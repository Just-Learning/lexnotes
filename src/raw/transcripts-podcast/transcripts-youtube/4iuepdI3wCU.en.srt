the act of remembering can change the

the act of remembering can change the

00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,349
the act of remembering can change the
memory if you remember some event and

memory if you remember some event and
 

5
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,270
memory if you remember some event and
then I tell you something about the

6
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:07,280
then I tell you something about the
 

7
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,549
then I tell you something about the
event later on when you remember the

8
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:10,559
event later on when you remember the
 

9
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,629
event later on when you remember the
event you might remember some original

10
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
event you might remember some original
 

11
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,270
event you might remember some original
information from the event as well as

12
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
information from the event as well as
 

13
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,670
information from the event as well as
some information about what I told you

14
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
some information about what I told you
 

15
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,950
some information about what I told you
and sometimes if you're not able to tell

16
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:19,960
and sometimes if you're not able to tell
 

17
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,109
and sometimes if you're not able to tell
the difference that information that I

18
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:22,119
the difference that information that I
 

19
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:24,429
the difference that information that I
told you gets mixed into the story that

20
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:24,439
told you gets mixed into the story that
 

21
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,750
told you gets mixed into the story that
you had originally so now I give you

you had originally so now I give you
some more misinformation or you're

experiencing self and the remembering

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,310
experiencing self and the remembering

you gained from the outcomes of your

you gained from the outcomes of your
 

59
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:15,590
you gained from the outcomes of your
decisions did not come from what you've

60
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
decisions did not come from what you've
 

61
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,990
decisions did not come from what you've
experienced but rather from what you

62
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
experienced but rather from what you
 

63
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,550
experienced but rather from what you
remember of the experience so uh can you

64
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
remember of the experience so uh can you
 

65
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,429
remember of the experience so uh can you
speak to this interesting difference

66
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:22,439
speak to this interesting difference
 

67
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,270
speak to this interesting difference
that you write about in your book of the

68
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,280
that you write about in your book of the
 

69
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,270
that you write about in your book of the
experiencing self and the remembering

self Danny really impacted me cuz I was

72
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:28,880
self Danny really impacted me cuz I was
 

73
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,270
self Danny really impacted me cuz I was
an undergrad at Berkeley and I got to

74
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
an undergrad at Berkeley and I got to
 

75
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,990
an undergrad at Berkeley and I got to
take a class from him long before he won

76
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,000
take a class from him long before he won
 

77
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,630
take a class from him long before he won
the Nobel Prize or anything and it was

78
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:34,640
the Nobel Prize or anything and it was
 

79
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,510
the Nobel Prize or anything and it was
just a mind-blowing class but this idea

80
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
just a mind-blowing class but this idea
 

81
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,510
just a mind-blowing class but this idea
of the remembering self and the

82
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
of the remembering self and the
 

83
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,749
of the remembering self and the
experiencing self I got into it because

84
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:42,759
experiencing self I got into it because
 

85
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,830
experiencing self I got into it because
it's so much about memory even though he

86
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:44,840
it's so much about memory even though he
 

87
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,389
it's so much about memory even though he
doesn't study memory so we're right now

88
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:47,399
doesn't study memory so we're right now
 

89
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,749
doesn't study memory so we're right now
having this experience right and people

90
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
having this experience right and people
 

91
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,950
having this experience right and people
are can watch it presumably on YouTube

92
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,960
are can watch it presumably on YouTube
 

93
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,310
are can watch it presumably on YouTube
or listen to it on audio but if you're

94
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:54,320
or listen to it on audio but if you're
 

95
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,029
or listen to it on audio but if you're
talking to somebody else you could

96
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:56,039
talking to somebody else you could
 

97
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,910
talking to somebody else you could
probably describe this whole thing in 10

98
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
probably describe this whole thing in 10
 

99
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,789
probably describe this whole thing in 10
minutes but that's going to miss a lot

100
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
minutes but that's going to miss a lot
 

101
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,469
minutes but that's going to miss a lot
of what actually happened and so the

102
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:03,479
of what actually happened and so the
 

103
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,670
of what actually happened and so the
idea there is is that the way we

104
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,680
idea there is is that the way we
 

105
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,949
idea there is is that the way we
remember things is not the replay of the

106
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
remember things is not the replay of the
 

107
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,469
remember things is not the replay of the
experience it's something totally

108
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
experience it's something totally
 

109
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,869
experience it's something totally
different and it tends to be biased by

110
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
different and it tends to be biased by
 

111
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,270
different and it tends to be biased by
the beginning and the end and he talks

112
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,280
the beginning and the end and he talks
 

113
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,589
the beginning and the end and he talks
about the Peaks but there's also the you

114
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
about the Peaks but there's also the you
 

115
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,790
about the Peaks but there's also the you
know the best parts the worst Parts Etc

116
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
know the best parts the worst Parts Etc
 

117
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,270
know the best parts the worst Parts Etc
and those are the things that we

118
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:22,280
and those are the things that we
 

119
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,390
and those are the things that we
remember and so when we make decisions

120
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,400
remember and so when we make decisions
 

121
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,589
remember and so when we make decisions
we usually consult memory and we feel

122
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:28,599
we usually consult memory and we feel
 

123
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,509
we usually consult memory and we feel
like our memories are record of what

124
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:30,519
like our memories are record of what
 

125
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,430
like our memories are record of what
we've experienced but it's not it's this

126
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,440
we've experienced but it's not it's this
 

127
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,949
we've experienced but it's not it's this
kind of very biased sample but it's

128
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:35,959
kind of very biased sample but it's
 

129
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,910
kind of very biased sample but it's
biased in an interesting and I think

130
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
biased in an interesting and I think
 

131
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,110
biased in an interesting and I think
biologically relevant way so in the way

132
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,120
biologically relevant way so in the way
 

133
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,790
biologically relevant way so in the way
we construct a narrative about our

134
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:43,800
we construct a narrative about our
 

135
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,949
we construct a narrative about our
past you say that uh it gives us an

136
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
past you say that uh it gives us an
 

137
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,949
past you say that uh it gives us an
illusion of stability can you explain

138
00:02:49,949 --> 00:02:49,959
illusion of stability can you explain
 

139
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,869
illusion of stability can you explain
that basically I think that a lot of

140
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:53,879
that basically I think that a lot of
 

141
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,509
that basically I think that a lot of
learning in the brain is driven towards

142
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:56,519
learning in the brain is driven towards
 

143
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:58,790
learning in the brain is driven towards
being able to make sense I mean really

144
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
being able to make sense I mean really
 

145
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,430
being able to make sense I mean really
memory is all about the the present and

146
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
memory is all about the the present and
 

147
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,869
memory is all about the the present and
the Future Past is done so biologically

148
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:03,879
the Future Past is done so biologically
 

149
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,229
the Future Past is done so biologically
speaking it's not important unless

150
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
speaking it's not important unless
 

151
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,949
speaking it's not important unless
there's something from the past that's

152
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:07,959
there's something from the past that's
 

153
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,309
there's something from the past that's
useful and so what our brains are really

154
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
useful and so what our brains are really
 

155
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,670
useful and so what our brains are really
optimized for is to learn about the

156
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
optimized for is to learn about the
 

157
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,309
optimized for is to learn about the
stuff from the past that's going to be

158
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:15,319
stuff from the past that's going to be
 

159
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,789
stuff from the past that's going to be
most useful in understanding the present

160
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:17,799
most useful in understanding the present
 

161
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,390
most useful in understanding the present
and predicting the future right and so

162
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400

videos of it now because this is kind of
 

209
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,069

the world we live in so that's like

210
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:12,079
the world we live in so that's like
 

211
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:13,869
the world we live in so that's like
everyday fortune telling that we do

212

everyday fortune telling that we do
 

213
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,270
everyday fortune telling that we do
though it's not real it's imagine and

214
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
though it's not real it's imagine and
 

215
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,590
though it's not real it's imagine and
it's amazing that we have this

216
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,600
it's amazing that we have this
 

217
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,749
it's amazing that we have this
capability and that's what memory is

218
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:20,759
capability and that's what memory is
 

219
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,310
capability and that's what memory is
about uh but it can also give us this

220
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,320
about uh but it can also give us this
 

221
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,430
about uh but it can also give us this
illusion that we know everything that's

222
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
illusion that we know everything that's
 

223
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,469
illusion that we know everything that's
about to happen um and I think what's

224
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:28,479
about to happen um and I think what's
 

225
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,710
about to happen um and I think what's
valuable about that that illusion is

226
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
valuable about that that illusion is
 

227
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,310
valuable about that that illusion is
when it's broken it gives us the

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:33,320
when it's broken it gives us the
 

229
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,110
when it's broken it gives us the
information right so I mean I'm sure

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,120
information right so I mean I'm sure
 

231
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,830
information right so I mean I'm sure
being in AI you know about information

232
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
being in AI you know about information

Theory and the idea is the information

234
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:39,960
Theory and the idea is the information
 

235
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,430
Theory and the idea is the information
is what you didn't already have and so

236
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:42,440
is what you didn't already have and so

00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,270
is what you didn't already have and so
those prediction errors that we make

those prediction errors that we make
 

239
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,150

475
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,069

I just said well failure is not an
 

477
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,150
I just said well failure is not an
option and eventually I got out of it

478
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
option and eventually I got out of it
 

479
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,829
option and eventually I got out of it
and uh froze and got cut up and I mean

started to tell people in my lab about
 

499
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,150
started to tell people in my lab about
this and then friends and it just became

500

we actually had some photos of just the
 

505
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,150
we actually had some photos of just the
crazy things like this generator that

506
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,160
crazy things like this generator that
 

507
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,150
crazy things like this generator that
was hanging over the water and we're

508
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,160
was hanging over the water and we're
 

509
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,310
was hanging over the water and we're
like ducking under this Z these metal

510
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,320
like ducking under this Z these metal
 

511
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,069
like ducking under this Z these metal
grings and I'm like going flat on and I

512
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
grings and I'm like going flat on and I
 

513
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,110
grings and I'm like going flat on and I
was just nuts you know but it became a

514
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
was just nuts you know but it became a
 

515
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,110
was just nuts you know but it became a
great story and it was defin I mean

Randy and I were already tight but that

518
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:28,519
Randy and I were already tight but that
 

519
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:31,350
Randy and I were already tight but that
was a real bonding experience for us and

520
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
was a real bonding experience for us and
 

521
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,790
was a real bonding experience for us and
yeah I mean and I learned from that that

522
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:33,800
yeah I mean and I learned from that that
 

523
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,910
yeah I mean and I learned from that that
it's like I don't look back on that

524
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
it's like I don't look back on that
 

525
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,910
it's like I don't look back on that
enough actually because I think uh we

526
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
enough actually because I think uh we
 

527
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,069
enough actually because I think uh we
often H at least for me I don't

528
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
often H at least for me I don't
 

529
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,949
often H at least for me I don't
necessarily have the confidence to think

530
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:43,959
necessarily have the confidence to think
 

531
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,710
necessarily have the confidence to think
that things will work out that I'll be

532
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:45,720
that things will work out that I'll be
 

533
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,030
that things will work out that I'll be
able to get through certain thing but my

534
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,040
able to get through certain thing but my
 

535
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,350
able to get through certain thing but my
ability to to actually get something

536
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,360
ability to to actually get something
 

537
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,870
ability to to actually get something
done in that moment is better than I

538
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
done in that moment is better than I
 

539
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,790
done in that moment is better than I
give myself credit for I think and uh

540
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
give myself credit for I think and uh
 

541
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,389
give myself credit for I think and uh
that was the lesson of that story that I

542
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
that was the lesson of that story that I
 

543
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,430
that was the lesson of that story that I
really took away well actually just for

544
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:00,440
really took away well actually just for
 

545
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,990
really took away well actually just for
me you're making me realize now that

546
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
me you're making me realize now that
 

547
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,470
me you're making me realize now that
it's not just those kinds of stories but

548
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
it's not just those kinds of stories but
 

549
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,949
it's not just those kinds of stories but
even things like periods of depression

550
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:09,959
even things like periods of depression
 

551
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:12,990
even things like periods of depression
or really low points to me at least it

552
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:13,000
or really low points to me at least it
 

553
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,069
or really low points to me at least it
feels like um motivating thing that the

554
00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:17,079
feels like um motivating thing that the
 

555
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,509
feels like um motivating thing that the
darker it gets the better the story will

556
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
darker it gets the better the story will
 

557
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,829
darker it gets the better the story will
be if you emerge on the other side that

558
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
be if you emerge on the other side that
 

559
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,230
be if you emerge on the other side that
to me feel feels like a motivating thing

560
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
to me feel feels like a motivating thing
 

561
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,030
to me feel feels like a motivating thing
so maybe if people listening to this and

562
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,040
so maybe if people listening to this and
 

563
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,470
so maybe if people listening to this and
they're going through some as we

564
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
they're going through some as we
 

565
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,509
they're going through some as we
said uh one one thing um that could be a

566
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:32,519
said uh one one thing um that could be a
 

567
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,389
said uh one one thing um that could be a
source of light is that it'll be a hell

568
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
source of light is that it'll be a hell
 

569
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,550
source of light is that it'll be a hell
of a good story when it's all over when

570
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
of a good story when it's all over when
 

571
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,590
of a good story when it's all over when
you merge in the other

572
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:38,600
you merge in the other
 

573
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,430
you merge in the other
side uh let me ask you about decisions

574
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
side uh let me ask you about decisions
 

575
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,670
side uh let me ask you about decisions
you've you already talked about it a

576
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:42,680
you've you already talked about it a
 

577
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,389
you've you already talked about it a
little bit but when we Face the world

578
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:45,399
little bit but when we Face the world
 

579
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,310
little bit but when we Face the world
and we're making different

580
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:47,320
and we're making different
 

581
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,230
and we're making different
decisions how much does our

582
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
decisions how much does our
 

583
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,110
decisions how much does our
memory come into play is it the the kind

584
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
memory come into play is it the the kind
 

585
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,269
memory come into play is it the the kind
of narratives that we've constructed

586
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
of narratives that we've constructed
 

587
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,509
of narratives that we've constructed
about the world that are used to make

588
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:57,519
about the world that are used to make
 

589
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,790
about the world that are used to make
predictions that's fundamentally part of

590
00:11:59,790 --> 00:11:59,800
predictions that's fundamentally part of
 

591
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,389
predictions that's fundamentally part of
the decision- making absolutely yeah so

592
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
the decision- making absolutely yeah so
 

593
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,069
the decision- making absolutely yeah so
let's say after this you and I decided

594
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
let's say after this you and I decided
 

595
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,990
let's say after this you and I decided
we're going to go for a beer right how

596
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
we're going to go for a beer right how
 

597
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,590
we're going to go for a beer right how
do you choose where to go you're

598
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:07,600
do you choose where to go you're
 

599
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,910
do you choose where to go you're
probably going to be like oh yeah this

600
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:08,920
probably going to be like oh yeah this
 

601
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,990
probably going to be like oh yeah this
new bar opened up near me had a great

602
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,000
new bar opened up near me had a great
 

603
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,870
new bar opened up near me had a great
time there they had a great beer

604
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
time there they had a great beer
 

605
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,990
time there they had a great beer
selection or you might say oh we went to

606
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,000
selection or you might say oh we went to
 

607
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,910
selection or you might say oh we went to
this place and it was totally crowded

608
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:16,920
this place and it was totally crowded
 

609
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,949
this place and it was totally crowded
and they're playing this horrible EDM or

610
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
and they're playing this horrible EDM or
 

611
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,910
and they're playing this horrible EDM or
whatever and so right there valuable

612
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:22,920
whatever and so right there valuable
 

613
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,470
whatever and so right there valuable
source of information right and then you

614
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:25,480
source of information right and then you
 

615
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,550
source of information right and then you
have these things like where you do this

616
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,560
have these things like where you do this
 

617
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,910
have these things like where you do this
counterfactual stuff like well well I

618
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:29,920
counterfactual stuff like well well I
 

619
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,710
counterfactual stuff like well well I
did this previously but what if I had

620
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:31,720
did this previously but what if I had
 

621
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,230
did this previously but what if I had
gone somewhere else and said maybe I'll

622
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,240
gone somewhere else and said maybe I'll
 

623
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,710
gone somewhere else and said maybe I'll
go to this other place because I didn't

624
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
go to this other place because I didn't
 

625
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,310
go to this other place because I didn't
try it the previous time so there's all

626
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,320
try it the previous time so there's all
 

627
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,629
try it the previous time so there's all
that kind of reasoning that goes into it

628
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:39,639
that kind of reasoning that goes into it
 

629
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,509
that kind of reasoning that goes into it
too um I think even if you think about

630
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:42,519
too um I think even if you think about
 

631
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,790
too um I think even if you think about
the big decisions in life right it's

632
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800
the big decisions in life right it's
 

633
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,629
the big decisions in life right it's
like you and I were talking before we

634
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
like you and I were talking before we
 

635
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,829
like you and I were talking before we
started recording about how I got into

636
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:48,839
started recording about how I got into
 

637
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,389
started recording about how I got into
memory research and you got into uh Ai

638
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
memory research and you got into uh Ai
 

639
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,829
memory research and you got into uh Ai
and it's like we all have these personal

640
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:54,839
and it's like we all have these personal
 

641
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,590
and it's like we all have these personal
reasons that guide us in these

642
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:56,600
reasons that guide us in these
 

643
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,269
reasons that guide us in these
particular directions and some of it's

644
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:58,279
particular directions and some of it's
 

645
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,870
particular directions and some of it's
the and environment and random factors

646
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
the and environment and random factors
 

647
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,470
the and environment and random factors
in life and some of it is memories of

648
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,480
in life and some of it is memories of
 

649
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,389
in life and some of it is memories of
things that we want to overcome or

650
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
things that we want to overcome or
 

651
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,350
things that we want to overcome or
things that we build on in a positive

652
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
things that we build on in a positive
 

653
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,629
things that we build on in a positive
way but either way they Define us and

654
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:13,639
way but either way they Define us and
 

655
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,269
way but either way they Define us and
probably the earlier in life the

656
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
probably the earlier in life the
 

657
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,670
probably the earlier in life the
memories happen the more defining the

658
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:17,680
memories happen the more defining the
 

659
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,509
memories happen the more defining the
more defining power they have in terms

660
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
more defining power they have in terms
 

661
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,269
more defining power they have in terms
of determining who we become I mean I do

662
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:22,279
of determining who we become I mean I do
 

663
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,629
of determining who we become I mean I do
feel like adolesence is much more

664
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
feel like adolesence is much more
 

665
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,030
feel like adolesence is much more
important than I think people give

666
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,040
important than I think people give
 

667
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,189
important than I think people give
credit for I think that there is this

668
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:28,199
credit for I think that there is this
 

669
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:30,069
credit for I think that there is this
kind of a sense like you know um the

670
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
kind of a sense like you know um the
 

671
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,990
kind of a sense like you know um the
first three years of life is the most

672
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
first three years of life is the most
 

673
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,310
first three years of life is the most
important part but uh the teenage years

674
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,320
important part but uh the teenage years
 

675
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,350
important part but uh the teenage years
are just so important for the brain you

676
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:38,360
are just so important for the brain you
 

677
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,949
are just so important for the brain you
know and so that's where a lot of mental

678
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
know and so that's where a lot of mental
 

679
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,230
know and so that's where a lot of mental
illness starts to emerge um you know now

680
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,240
illness starts to emerge um you know now
 

681
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,189
illness starts to emerge um you know now
we're thinking of things like

682
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:44,199
we're thinking of things like
 

683
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,310
we're thinking of things like
schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental

684
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:46,320
schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental
 

685
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,829
schizophrenia as a neurodevelopmental
disorder because it just emerges during

686
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:48,839
disorder because it just emerges during
 

687
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,189
disorder because it just emerges during
that period of adolescence and early

688
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:51,199
that period of adolescence and early
 

689
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,189
that period of adolescence and early
adulthood so and I think the other part

690
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:54,199
adulthood so and I think the other part
 

691
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,710
adulthood so and I think the other part
of it is is that you know as I guess I

692
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
of it is is that you know as I guess I
 

693
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,670
of it is is that you know as I guess I
was a little bit too firm in saying that

694
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:58,680
was a little bit too firm in saying that
 

695
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,350
was a little bit too firm in saying that
memory determines who we are it's really

696
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
memory determines who we are it's really
 

697
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,470
memory determines who we are it's really
the self is an evolving construct I

698
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:03,480
the self is an evolving construct I
 

699
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,150
the self is an evolving construct I
think we kind of underestimate that and

700
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
think we kind of underestimate that and
 

701
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,350
think we kind of underestimate that and
when you're a parent you feel like every

702
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
when you're a parent you feel like every
 

703
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,230
when you're a parent you feel like every
decision you make is consequential in

704
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,240
decision you make is consequential in
 

705
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,509
decision you make is consequential in
forming this child and plays a role but

706
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
forming this child and plays a role but
 

707
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,790
forming this child and plays a role but
so do the child's peers and so do you

708
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
so do the child's peers and so do you
 

709
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,749
so do the child's peers and so do you
know there's so much I mean that's why I

710
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:20,759
know there's so much I mean that's why I
 

711
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,829
know there's so much I mean that's why I
think the big part of Education I think

712
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:22,839
think the big part of Education I think
 

713
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:25,350
think the big part of Education I think
that's so important is not the content

714
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
that's so important is not the content
 

715
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,550
that's so important is not the content
you learn I mean think of how much dumb

716
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:27,560
you learn I mean think of how much dumb
 

717
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,350
you learn I mean think of how much dumb
stuff we learned in school right but uh

718
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
stuff we learned in school right but uh
 

719
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,389
stuff we learned in school right but uh
a lot of it is learning how to get along

720
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:33,399
a lot of it is learning how to get along
 

721
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,749
a lot of it is learning how to get along
with people and learning who you are and

722
00:14:36,749 --> 00:14:36,759
with people and learning who you are and
 

723
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,189
with people and learning who you are and
how you function and you know that can

724
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
how you function and you know that can
 

725
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,430
how you function and you know that can
be terribly traumatizing even if you

726
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
be terribly traumatizing even if you
 

727
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,110
be terribly traumatizing even if you
have a perfect you know parents working

728
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,120
have a perfect you know parents working
 

729
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,230
have a perfect you know parents working
on you is there some insight into the

730
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:47,240
on you is there some insight into the
 

731
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,710
on you is there some insight into the
human brain that explains um why we

732
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
human brain that explains um why we
 

733
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,310
human brain that explains um why we
don't seem to remember anything from the

734
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
don't seem to remember anything from the
 

735
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,150
don't seem to remember anything from the
first few years of life yeah yeah in

736
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,160
first few years of life yeah yeah in
 

737
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,110
first few years of life yeah yeah in
fact actually I was just talking to my

738
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
fact actually I was just talking to my
 

739
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,509
fact actually I was just talking to my
uh really good friend and colleague

740
00:14:58,509 --> 00:14:58,519
uh really good friend and colleague
 

741
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,629
uh really good friend and colleague
Simona gy who studies uh the

742
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
Simona gy who studies uh the
 

743
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,430
Simona gy who studies uh the
Neuroscience of Child Development and so

744
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:02,440
Neuroscience of Child Development and so
 

745
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,710
Neuroscience of Child Development and so
we were talking about this and so there

746
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720
we were talking about this and so there
 

747
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,790
we were talking about this and so there
are a bunch of reasons I would say so

748
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:07,800
are a bunch of reasons I would say so
 

749
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,470
are a bunch of reasons I would say so
one reason is there's an area of the

750
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:09,480
one reason is there's an area of the
 

751
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,790
one reason is there's an area of the
brain in the called the hippocampus

752
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:11,800
brain in the called the hippocampus
 

753
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,310
brain in the called the hippocampus
which is very very important for

754
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:13,320
which is very very important for
 

755
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,269
which is very very important for
remembering events or episodic memory

756
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:16,279
remembering events or episodic memory
 

757
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,389
remembering events or episodic memory
and so the first two years of life

758
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:18,399
and so the first two years of life
 

759
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,470
and so the first two years of life
there's a period called infantile

760
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
there's a period called infantile
 

761
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,870
there's a period called infantile
Amnesia and then the next couple years

762
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
Amnesia and then the next couple years
 

763
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,150
Amnesia and then the next couple years
of life after that there's a period

764
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,160
of life after that there's a period
 

765
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,629
of life after that there's a period
called childhood Amnesia and the

766
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
called childhood Amnesia and the
 

767
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,110
called childhood Amnesia and the
difference is that basically in lab and

768
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,120
difference is that basically in lab and
 

769
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,350
difference is that basically in lab and
you know even during childhood and

770
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:32,360
you know even during childhood and
 

771
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,069
you know even during childhood and
afterwards children basically don't have

772
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:36,079
afterwards children basically don't have
 

773
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,189
afterwards children basically don't have
any episodic memories for those first

774
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:38,199
any episodic memories for those first
 

775
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,550
any episodic memories for those first
two years the next two years it's very

776
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:40,560
two years the next two years it's very
 

777
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,110
two years the next two years it's very
fragmentary and that's why they call it

778
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:42,120
fragmentary and that's why they call it
 

779
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,710
fragmentary and that's why they call it
childhood Amnesia so there's some but

780
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:43,720
childhood Amnesia so there's some but
 

781
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,550
childhood Amnesia so there's some but
it's not much so one reason is that the

782
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
it's not much so one reason is that the
 

783
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,309
it's not much so one reason is that the
hippocampus is taking some time to

784
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:48,319
hippocampus is taking some time to
 

785
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:51,350
hippocampus is taking some time to
develop but another is the neocortex so

786
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
develop but another is the neocortex so
 

787
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,629
develop but another is the neocortex so
the whole folded stuff of gray matter

788
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:53,639
the whole folded stuff of gray matter
 

789
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,910
the whole folded stuff of gray matter
all around the hippocampus is developing

790
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:56,920
all around the hippocampus is developing
 

791
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,629
all around the hippocampus is developing
so rapidly and changing

792
00:15:59,629 --> 00:15:59,639
so rapidly and changing
 

793
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,509
so rapidly and changing
and a child's knowledge of the world is

794
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:01,519
and a child's knowledge of the world is
 

795
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,670
and a child's knowledge of the world is
just massively being built up right so I

796
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:04,680
just massively being built up right so I
 

797
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,550
just massively being built up right so I
mean I'm going to probably embarrass

798
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:06,560
mean I'm going to probably embarrass
 

799
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,309
mean I'm going to probably embarrass
myself but it's like if you showed like

800
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:09,319
myself but it's like if you showed like
 

801
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,949
myself but it's like if you showed like
you know you trained a neural network

802
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
you know you trained a neural network
 

803
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,350
you know you trained a neural network
and you give it like the first couple of

804
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,360
and you give it like the first couple of
 

805
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,189
and you give it like the first couple of
patterns or something like that and then

806
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:14,199
patterns or something like that and then
 

807
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,949
patterns or something like that and then
you bombard it with another like you

808
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:15,959
you bombard it with another like you
 

809
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:18,629
you bombard it with another like you
know years worth of data try to get back

810
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
know years worth of data try to get back
 

811
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,309
know years worth of data try to get back
those first couple of patterns right

812
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:20,319
those first couple of patterns right
 

813
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,670
those first couple of patterns right
it's like everything changes and so the

814
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:23,680
it's like everything changes and so the
 

815
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,030
it's like everything changes and so the
brain is so plastic the cortex is so

816
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,040
brain is so plastic the cortex is so
 

817
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,790
brain is so plastic the cortex is so
plastic during that time and we think

818
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:28,800
plastic during that time and we think
 

819
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,829
plastic during that time and we think
that that memories for events are very

820
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:30,839
that that memories for events are very
 

821
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,269
that that memories for events are very
distributed across the brain so imagine

822
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
distributed across the brain so imagine
 

823
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,269
distributed across the brain so imagine
you're trying to get back that pattern

824
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
you're trying to get back that pattern
 

825
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,870
you're trying to get back that pattern
of activity that happened during this

826
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
of activity that happened during this
 

827
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,389
of activity that happened during this
one moment but the roads that you would

828
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:39,399
one moment but the roads that you would
 

829
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,990
one moment but the roads that you would
take to get there have been completely

830
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:41,000
take to get there have been completely
 

831
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,189
take to get there have been completely
rerouted right so I think that's my best

832
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:44,199
rerouted right so I think that's my best
 

833
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,350
rerouted right so I think that's my best
explanation the third explanation is a

834
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:46,360
explanation the third explanation is a
 

835
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,990
explanation the third explanation is a
child's sense of self takes a while to

836
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,000
child's sense of self takes a while to
 

837
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,470
child's sense of self takes a while to
develop and so their experience of

838
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
develop and so their experience of
 

839
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,269
develop and so their experience of
learning might be more learning what

840
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:54,279
learning might be more learning what
 

841
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,710
learning might be more learning what
happened as opposed to having this first

842
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:56,720
happened as opposed to having this first
 

843
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,590
happened as opposed to having this first
person experience of I remember was

844
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
person experience of I remember was
 

845
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,590
person experience of I remember was
there well I think somebody uh once said

846
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:04,600
there well I think somebody uh once said
 

847
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,510
there well I think somebody uh once said
to me that uh kind of loosely

848
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:08,520
to me that uh kind of loosely
 

849
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,429
to me that uh kind of loosely
philosophically that the reason we don't

850
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:11,439
philosophically that the reason we don't
 

851
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,270
philosophically that the reason we don't
remember the first few years of life

852
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,280
remember the first few years of life
 

853
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,949
remember the first few years of life
infantile Amnesia is because how

infantile Amnesia is because how
 

855
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,069
infantile Amnesia is because how
traumatic it is MH basically the the

traumatic it is MH basically the the
 

857
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,069
traumatic it is MH basically the the
error rate that you mentioned when your

858
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,079
error rate that you mentioned when your
 

859
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,710
error rate that you mentioned when your

860
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:25,720
brain's prediction doesn't match reality
 

861
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,669
brain's prediction doesn't match reality
the error rate in the first few years of

862
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:27,679
the error rate in the first few years of
 

863
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,029
the error rate in the first few years of
life your first few months certainly is

864
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:30,039
life your first few months certainly is
 

865
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:33,029
life your first few months certainly is
probably crazy high it's just nonstop

866
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
probably crazy high it's just nonstop
 

867
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,110
probably crazy high it's just nonstop
freaking out the the collision between

868
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:36,120
freaking out the the collision between
 

869
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,710
freaking out the the collision between
your model of the world and how the

870
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:37,720
your model of the world and how the
 

871
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,310
your model of the world and how the
world works is just so high that you

872
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
world works is just so high that you
 

873
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,789
world works is just so high that you
want whatever the trauma of that is not

874
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
want whatever the trauma of that is not
 

875
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,710
want whatever the trauma of that is not
to linger around I always thought that

876
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:45,720
to linger around I always thought that
 

877
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,750
to linger around I always thought that
an interesting idea because like just

878
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:48,760
an interesting idea because like just
 

879
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,990
an interesting idea because like just
imagine the insanity of what's happening

880
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,000
imagine the insanity of what's happening
 

881
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,789
imagine the insanity of what's happening
in a human brain in the first couple

882
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:52,799
in a human brain in the first couple
 

883
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,149
in a human brain in the first couple
years just you you don't know anything

884
00:17:56,149 --> 00:17:56,159
years just you you don't know anything
 

885
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,630
years just you you don't know anything
and there's just this stream of

886
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:57,640
and there's just this stream of
 

887
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,390
and there's just this stream of
knowledge and we're somehow

888
00:17:59,390 --> 00:17:59,400
knowledge and we're somehow
 

889
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,230
knowledge and we're somehow
given how plastic everything is he just

890
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,240
given how plastic everything is he just
 

891
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,430
given how plastic everything is he just
kind of molds and figures it out but

892
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:03,440
kind of molds and figures it out but
 

893
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,190
kind of molds and figures it out but
it's it's like an

894
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:06,200
it's it's like an
 

895
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,149
it's it's like an
insane waterfall of information I

896
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:09,159
insane waterfall of information I
 

897
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:10,470
insane waterfall of information I
wouldn't necessarily describe it as a

898
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
wouldn't necessarily describe it as a
 

899
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,750
wouldn't necessarily describe it as a
trauma and we can get into this whole

900
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
trauma and we can get into this whole
 

901
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,909
trauma and we can get into this whole
stages of Life thing which I just love

902
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:14,919
stages of Life thing which I just love
 

903
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:17,029
stages of Life thing which I just love
basically those first few years there

904
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
basically those first few years there
 

905
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,549
basically those first few years there
are I mean you know I mean think about

906
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
are I mean you know I mean think about
 

907
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,990
are I mean you know I mean think about
it a kid's internal model of their body

908
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
it a kid's internal model of their body
 

909
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,070
it a kid's internal model of their body
is changing right it's like just

910
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
is changing right it's like just
 

911
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,310
is changing right it's like just
learning to move I mean like you know

912
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,320
learning to move I mean like you know
 

913
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,390
learning to move I mean like you know
you if you ever have a baby you'll know

914
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
you if you ever have a baby you'll know
 

915
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,029
you if you ever have a baby you'll know
that like the first three months they're

916
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:30,039
that like the first three months they're
 

917
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:32,230
that like the first three months they're
discovering their toes right it's just

918
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
discovering their toes right it's just
 

919
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,990
discovering their toes right it's just
nuts so everything is changing but

920
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,000
nuts so everything is changing but
 

921
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,149
nuts so everything is changing but
what's really fascinating is and I think

922
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:37,159
what's really fascinating is and I think
 

923
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,310
what's really fascinating is and I think
this is one of those this is not at all

924
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,320
this is one of those this is not at all
 

925
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,909
this is one of those this is not at all
me being a scientist but it's like one

926
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:40,919
me being a scientist but it's like one
 

927
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,310
me being a scientist but it's like one
of those things that people talk about

928
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
of those things that people talk about
 

929
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,110
of those things that people talk about
when they talk about the you know

930
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
when they talk about the you know
 

931
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,110
when they talk about the you know
positive aspects of children is that

932
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,120
positive aspects of children is that
 

933
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,190
positive aspects of children is that
they're exceptionally curious and they

934
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,200
they're exceptionally curious and they
 

935
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,830
they're exceptionally curious and they
have this kind of openness towards the

936
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:52,840
have this kind of openness towards the
 

937
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,750
have this kind of openness towards the
world and so that prediction error is

938
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
world and so that prediction error is
 

939
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,510
world and so that prediction error is
not a a negative traumatic thing I think

940
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:58,520
not a a negative traumatic thing I think
 

941
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,149
not a a negative traumatic thing I think
it's like a very positive thing because

942
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:01,159
it's like a very positive thing because
 

943
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:03,230
it's like a very positive thing because
it's what they use they're seeking

944
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:03,240
it's what they use they're seeking
 

945
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,149
it's what they use they're seeking
information one of the areas that I'm

946
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:05,159
information one of the areas that I'm
 

947
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:07,110
information one of the areas that I'm
very interested in is the prefrontal

948
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:07,120
very interested in is the prefrontal
 

949
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,870
very interested in is the prefrontal
cortex it's an area of the brain that I

950
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:09,880
cortex it's an area of the brain that I
 

951
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,750
cortex it's an area of the brain that I
mean I could talk all day about it but

952
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
mean I could talk all day about it but
 

953
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,029
mean I could talk all day about it but
it's it helps us use our knowledge to

954
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
it's it helps us use our knowledge to
 

955
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,230
it's it helps us use our knowledge to
say hey this is what I want to do now

956
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:17,240
say hey this is what I want to do now
 

957
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,870
say hey this is what I want to do now
this is my goal so this is how I'm going

958
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:19,880
this is my goal so this is how I'm going
 

959
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,430
this is my goal so this is how I'm going
to achieve it and focus everything

960
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:22,440
to achieve it and focus everything
 

961
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,310
to achieve it and focus everything
toward cycle right the prefrontal cortex

962
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,320
toward cycle right the prefrontal cortex
 

963
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,990
toward cycle right the prefrontal cortex
takes forever to develop in humans the

964
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
takes forever to develop in humans the
 

965
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,909
takes forever to develop in humans the
connections are still being tweaked and

966
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
connections are still being tweaked and
 

967
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,510
connections are still being tweaked and
reformed like into late adolescence

968
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
reformed like into late adolescence
 

969
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,669
reformed like into late adolescence
early adulthood which is when you tend

970
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:35,679
early adulthood which is when you tend
 

971
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,750
early adulthood which is when you tend
to see mental illness pop up right so

972
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:38,760
to see mental illness pop up right so
 

973
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,990
to see mental illness pop up right so
it's being massively reformed then you

974
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,000
it's being massively reformed then you
 

975
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,590
it's being massively reformed then you
have about 10 years maybe of prime

976
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
have about 10 years maybe of prime
 

977
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,789
have about 10 years maybe of prime
functioning of the prefrontal cortex and

978
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:45,799
functioning of the prefrontal cortex and
 

979
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,870
functioning of the prefrontal cortex and
then it starts going down again and you

980
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:47,880
then it starts going down again and you
 

981
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,549
then it starts going down again and you
end up being older and you start losing

end up being older and you start losing
 

983
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,549
end up being older and you start losing
all that frontal function so look at

984
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:52,559
all that frontal function so look at
 

985
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,789
all that frontal function so look at
this and you'd say okay from you sit

around episodic memory talks we always

988
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:56,480
around episodic memory talks we always
 

989
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,029
around episodic memory talks we always
say children are worse than adults at

990
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:58,039
say children are worse than adults at

995
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,029
older adults or worse than young adults
at episodic memory and I always say

996
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:03,039
at episodic memory and I always say
 

997
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,430
at episodic memory and I always say
would say God this so weird why would we

998
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
would say God this so weird why would we
 

999
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,950
would say God this so weird why would we
have this period of time that's so short

1000
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:07,960
have this period of time that's so short
 

1001
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,549
have this period of time that's so short
when we're perfect right or optimal and

1002
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:10,559
when we're perfect right or optimal and
 

1003
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,430
when we're perfect right or optimal and
I I like to use the word optimal now

1004
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:12,440
I I like to use the word optimal now
 

1005
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,750
I I like to use the word optimal now
because there's such a culture of

1006
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
because there's such a culture of
 

1007
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,990
because there's such a culture of
optimization right now and it's like I

1008
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,000
optimization right now and it's like I
 

1009
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,270
optimization right now and it's like I
realize I have to redefine what optimal

1010
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
realize I have to redefine what optimal
 

1011
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,669
realize I have to redefine what optimal
is because for most of the Human

1012
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:22,679

know I'm part of this Village and I have
 

1023
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,549
know I'm part of this Village and I have
to hunt and forage and get things done I

1024
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
to hunt and forage and get things done I
 

1025
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,390
to hunt and forage and get things done I
need a prefrontal cortex so I can stay

1026
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
need a prefrontal cortex so I can stay
 

1027
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,149
need a prefrontal cortex so I can stay

Village I'm kind of wandering around and

1032
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,240
Village I'm kind of wandering around and
 

1033
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,830
Village I'm kind of wandering around and
I've got some safety and I need to learn

1034
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
I've got some safety and I need to learn
 

1035
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,669
I've got some safety and I need to learn
about this culture because I know so

1036
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
about this culture because I know so
 

1037
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,549
about this culture because I know so
little what's the best way to do that

1038
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:55,559
little what's the best way to do that
 

1039
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,190
little what's the best way to do that
let's explore I don't want to be

1040
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
let's explore I don't want to be
 

1041
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,190
let's explore I don't want to be
constrained by goals as much I want to

1042
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,200
constrained by goals as much I want to
 

1043
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,110
constrained by goals as much I want to
really be free play and explore and

1044
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,120
really be free play and explore and
 

1045
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,549
really be free play and explore and
learn so you don't want a super tight

1046
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
learn so you don't want a super tight
 

1047
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,149
learn so you don't want a super tight
prefrontal cortex you don't even know

1048
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
prefrontal cortex you don't even know
 

1049
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,029
prefrontal cortex you don't even know
what the goals should be yet right it's

1050
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:08,039
what the goals should be yet right it's
 

1051
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,549
what the goals should be yet right it's
like if you're trying to design a model

1052
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:10,559
like if you're trying to design a model
 

1053
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,230
like if you're trying to design a model
that's based on a bad goal it's G to

1054
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:13,240
that's based on a bad goal it's G to
 

1055
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,870
that's based on a bad goal it's G to
it's not going to work well right so

1056
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:15,880
it's not going to work well right so
 

1057
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,789
it's not going to work well right so
then you go late in life you say why

1058
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:17,799
then you go late in life you say why
 

1059
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,669
then you go late in life you say why
don't you have a great prefrontal cortex

1060
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
don't you have a great prefrontal cortex
 

1061
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,830
don't you have a great prefrontal cortex
then but I think I mean if you go back

1062
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:22,840
then but I think I mean if you go back
 

1063
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,549
then but I think I mean if you go back
and you think how many species actually

1064
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:25,559
and you think how many species actually
 

1065
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,149
and you think how many species actually
stick around naturally long after their

1066
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
stick around naturally long after their
 

1067
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,070
stick around naturally long after their
child bearing ears are over after the

1068
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
child bearing ears are over after the
 

1069
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,430
child bearing ears are over after the
reproductive years are over like

1070
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
reproductive years are over like
 

1071
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,190
reproductive years are over like
menopause from what I understand

1072
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
menopause from what I understand
 

1073
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,750
menopause from what I understand
menopause is not all that common in the

1074
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:35,760
menopause is not all that common in the
 

1075
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,830
menopause is not all that common in the
animal world right why would that happen

1076
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:38,840
animal world right why would that happen
 

1077
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,630
animal world right why would that happen
and so I saw Alison gnik said something

1078
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
and so I saw Alison gnik said something
 

1079
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,870
and so I saw Alison gnik said something
about this so I started to look into

1080
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:43,880
about this so I started to look into
 

1081
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,190
about this so I started to look into
this about this idea that you know

1082
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,200
this about this idea that you know
 

1083
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,830
this about this idea that you know
really when you're older in most

1084
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:48,840
really when you're older in most
 

1085
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,830
really when you're older in most
societies your job is no longer to form

1086
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840

1087
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,630

1089
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,350

00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,310
Generations pass on the culture you know
even now in indigenous cultures that's

1100
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
even now in indigenous cultures that's
 

1101
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,750
even now in indigenous cultures that's
the role of the elders they're respected

1102
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:08,760
the role of the elders they're respected
 

1103
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,630
the role of the elders they're respected
they're not seen as you know people who

1104
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:10,640
they're not seen as you know people who
 

1105
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,310
they're not seen as you know people who
are past it and losing it and I thought

1106
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:13,320
are past it and losing it and I thought
 

1107
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,110
are past it and losing it and I thought
that was a very poignant thing that

1108
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,120
that was a very poignant thing that
 

1109
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,230
that was a very poignant thing that
memory is doing what it's supposed to

1110
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,240
memory is doing what it's supposed to
 

1111
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,870
memory is doing what it's supposed to
throughout these stages of life so it is

1112
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:21,880
throughout these stages of life so it is
 

1113
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,310
throughout these stages of life so it is
always optimal in a sense it's just

1114
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
always optimal in a sense it's just
 

1115
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,789
always optimal in a sense it's just
optimal for that stage of Life yeah and

1116
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:26,799
optimal for that stage of Life yeah and
 

1117
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,310
optimal for that stage of Life yeah and
for the Ecology of the system so you've

1118
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:29,320
for the Ecology of the system so you've
 

1119
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,549
for the Ecology of the system so you've
got so I looked into this and it's like

1120
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:31,559
got so I looked into this and it's like
 

1121
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,470
got so I looked into this and it's like
another species that has menopause is

1122
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:33,480
another species that has menopause is
 

1123
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,830
another species that has menopause is
Orcas Orca pods are led by the

1124
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
Orcas Orca pods are led by the
 

1125
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,789
Orcas Orca pods are led by the
grandmothers right so not the young

1126
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:37,799
grandmothers right so not the young
 

1127
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:40,149
grandmothers right so not the young
adults not the parents or whatever the

1128
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
adults not the parents or whatever the
 

1129
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,430
adults not the parents or whatever the
grandmothers and so they're the ones

1130
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:42,440
grandmothers and so they're the ones
 

1131
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,310
grandmothers and so they're the ones
that pass on the Traditions to the I

1132
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,320
that pass on the Traditions to the I
 

1133
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,590
that pass on the Traditions to the I
guess the younger generation of orcas

1134
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:47,600
guess the younger generation of orcas
 

1135
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,149
guess the younger generation of orcas
and if you you know if you look from

1136
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:49,159
and if you you know if you look from
 

1137
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,149
and if you you know if you look from
what little I understand different Orca

1138
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:51,159
what little I understand different Orca
 

1139
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:53,990
what little I understand different Orca
pods have different Traditions they hunt

1140
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
pods have different Traditions they hunt
 

1141
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,470
pods have different Traditions they hunt
for different things they have different

1142
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:55,480
for different things they have different
 

1143
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,110
for different things they have different
play traditions and uh that's a culture

1144
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,120
play traditions and uh that's a culture
 

1145
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,750
play traditions and uh that's a culture
right and so in Social

1146
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:01,760
right and so in Social
 

1147
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,470
right and so in Social
animals Evolution I think is designing

1148
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:05,480
animals Evolution I think is designing
 

1149
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,909
animals Evolution I think is designing
brains that are really around you know

1150
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:07,919
brains that are really around you know
 

1151
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,830
brains that are really around you know
it's it's obviously optimized for the

1152
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:10,840
it's it's obviously optimized for the
 

1153
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,950
it's it's obviously optimized for the
individual but also for kin and I think

1154
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:13,960
individual but also for kin and I think
 

1155
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,470
individual but also for kin and I think
that the kin are part of this like when

1156
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
that the kin are part of this like when
 

1157
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,789
that the kin are part of this like when
they're part of this intense social

1158
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:17,799
they're part of this intense social
 

1159
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,350
they're part of this intense social
group The Brain development should

1160
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:20,360
group The Brain development should
 

1161
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,909
group The Brain development should
parallel that the nature of the ecology

1162
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:22,919
parallel that the nature of the ecology
 

1163
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,350
parallel that the nature of the ecology
well it's just fascinating to think of

1164
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
well it's just fascinating to think of
 

1165
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,350
well it's just fascinating to think of
the individual Orca or human throughout

1166
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
the individual Orca or human throughout
 

1167
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,909
the individual Orca or human throughout
his life in stages doing a kind of

1168
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:32,919
his life in stages doing a kind of
 

1169
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:37,070
his life in stages doing a kind of
optimal wisdom development so in the

1170
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,080
optimal wisdom development so in the
 

1171
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,269
optimal wisdom development so in the
early days you don't even know what the

1172
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:38,279
early days you don't even know what the
 

1173
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,710
early days you don't even know what the
goal is and you figure out the goal and

1174
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:39,720
goal is and you figure out the goal and
 

1175
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,269
goal is and you figure out the goal and
you kind of optimize for that goal and

1176
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
you kind of optimize for that goal and
 

1177
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,310
you kind of optimize for that goal and
you pursue that goal and then all the

1178
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,320
you pursue that goal and then all the
 

1179
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,710
you pursue that goal and then all the
wisdom you collect through that then you

1180
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
wisdom you collect through that then you
 

1181
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,029
wisdom you collect through that then you
share with the others in the system with

1182
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
share with the others in the system with
 

1183
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,190
share with the others in the system with
the other individuals and as a as a

1184
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
the other individuals and as a as a
 

1185
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,230
the other individuals and as a as a
collective then you kind of converge

1186
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,240
collective then you kind of converge
 

1187
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,230
collective then you kind of converge
towards greater wisdom throughout the

1188
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,240
towards greater wisdom throughout the
 

1189
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,510
towards greater wisdom throughout the
generation so in that sense it's optimal

1190
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:58,520
generation so in that sense it's optimal
 

1191
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,750
generation so in that sense it's optimal
us humans and orcas got something going

1192
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:00,760
us humans and orcas got something going
 

1193
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,350
us humans and orcas got something going
on it works yeah apex

1194
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:04,360
on it works yeah apex
 

1195
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,990
on it works yeah apex
predators uh I just got a meglan on

1196
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,000
predators uh I just got a meglan on
 

1197
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,750
predators uh I just got a meglan on
tooth speaking of a Apex parties it's uh

1198
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
tooth speaking of a Apex parties it's uh
 

1199
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,909
tooth speaking of a Apex parties it's uh
just imagine the size of that

1200
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
just imagine the size of that
 

1201
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,789
just imagine the size of that
thing anyway uh how does the brain

1202
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
thing anyway uh how does the brain
 

1203
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,990
thing anyway uh how does the brain
forget and how and why does it remember

1204
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,000
forget and how and why does it remember
 

1205
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,510
forget and how and why does it remember
so maybe some of the mechanisms you

1206
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:24,520
so maybe some of the mechanisms you
 

1207
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,149
so maybe some of the mechanisms you
mentioned the hippocampus what are the

1208
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,159
mentioned the hippocampus what are the
 

1209
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,669
mentioned the hippocampus what are the
different components involved here so we

1210
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:28,679
different components involved here so we
 

1211
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:29,950
different components involved here so we
can think about this on a number of

1212
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:29,960
can think about this on a number of
 

1213
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,590
can think about this on a number of
levels maybe I'll give you the simplest

1214
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
levels maybe I'll give you the simplest
 

1215
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,789
levels maybe I'll give you the simplest
version first which is we tend to think

1216
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:33,799
version first which is we tend to think
 

1217
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,710
version first which is we tend to think
of memories as these individual things

1218
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:35,720
of memories as these individual things
 

1219
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,909
of memories as these individual things
and we can just access them maybe a

1220
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:37,919
and we can just access them maybe a
 

1221
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,590
and we can just access them maybe a
little bit like you know photos on your

1222
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:39,600
little bit like you know photos on your
 

1223
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,110
little bit like you know photos on your
phone or something like that but in the

1224
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,120
phone or something like that but in the
 

1225
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,149
phone or something like that but in the
brain the way it works is you have this

1226
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
brain the way it works is you have this
 

1227
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,710
brain the way it works is you have this
distributed pool of neurons and the

1228
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:47,720
distributed pool of neurons and the
 

1229
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,750
distributed pool of neurons and the
memories are kind of shared across

1230
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:49,760
memories are kind of shared across
 

1231
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,070
memories are kind of shared across
different pools of neurons and so what

1232
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,080
different pools of neurons and so what
 

1233
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,750
different pools of neurons and so what
you have is competition where sometimes

1234
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:54,760
you have is competition where sometimes
 

1235
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,789
you have is competition where sometimes
memories that overlap can be fighting

1236
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
memories that overlap can be fighting
 

1237
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,710
memories that overlap can be fighting
against each other right so sometimes we

1238
00:24:59,710 --> 00:24:59,720
against each other right so sometimes we
 

1239
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,389
against each other right so sometimes we
forget because that competition just

1240
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:02,399
forget because that competition just
 

1241
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:04,870
forget because that competition just
wipes things out sometimes we forget

1242
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
wipes things out sometimes we forget
 

1243
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,630
wipes things out sometimes we forget
because there aren't the biological

1244
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:06,640
because there aren't the biological
 

1245
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,149
because there aren't the biological
signals which we can get into that would

1246
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:09,159
signals which we can get into that would
 

1247
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:11,549
signals which we can get into that would
promote long-term retention and lots of

1248
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:11,559
promote long-term retention and lots of
 

1249
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,510
promote long-term retention and lots of
times we forget because we can't find

1250
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:14,520
times we forget because we can't find
 

1251
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,470
times we forget because we can't find
the queue that sends us back to the

1252
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
the queue that sends us back to the
 

1253
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,630
the queue that sends us back to the
right memory and we need the right cue

1254
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:18,640
right memory and we need the right cue
 

1255
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,510
right memory and we need the right cue
to be able to activate it right so um

1256
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:21,520
to be able to activate it right so um
 

1257
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,669
to be able to activate it right so um
you know for instance in an neural

1258
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:22,679
you know for instance in an neural
 

1259
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,310
you know for instance in an neural
network there is no you wouldn't go and

1260
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,320
network there is no you wouldn't go and
 

1261
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,310
network there is no you wouldn't go and
you'd say this is the memory right it's

1262
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:27,320
you'd say this is the memory right it's
 

1263
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,630
you'd say this is the memory right it's
like the whole Network I mean the whole

1264
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:29,640
like the whole Network I mean the whole
 

1265
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,950
like the whole Network I mean the whole
ecosystem of memories is in the weights

1266
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:31,960
ecosystem of memories is in the weights
 

1267
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,669
ecosystem of memories is in the weights
of the neural network and in fact you

1268
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:33,679
of the neural network and in fact you
 

1269
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,430
of the neural network and in fact you
could extract entirely new memories

1270
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
could extract entirely new memories
 

1271
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,510
could extract entirely new memories
depending on how you feed yeah you have

1272
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:37,520
depending on how you feed yeah you have
 

1273
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,430
depending on how you feed yeah you have
to have the right query the right prompt

1274
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:39,440
to have the right query the right prompt
 

1275
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,590
to have the right query the right prompt
to access that whatever the part you're

1276
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,600
to access that whatever the part you're
 

1277
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,510
to access that whatever the part you're
looking for that's exactly right that's

1278
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,520
looking for that's exactly right that's
 

1279
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,149
looking for that's exactly right that's
exactly right and in humans you have

1280
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:45,159
exactly right and in humans you have
 

1281
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:47,549
exactly right and in humans you have
this more complex set of ways memory

1282
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:47,559
this more complex set of ways memory
 

1283
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,789
this more complex set of ways memory
works there's as I said the knowledge or

1284
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:49,799
works there's as I said the knowledge or
 

1285
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,430
works there's as I said the knowledge or
what you call semantic memory and then

1286
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
what you call semantic memory and then
 

1287
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,430
what you call semantic memory and then
there's these memories for specific

1288
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
there's these memories for specific
 

1289
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,669
there's these memories for specific
events which we call episodic memory and

1290
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:55,679
events which we call episodic memory and
 

1291
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,549
events which we call episodic memory and
so there's different pieces of the

1292
00:25:57,549 --> 00:25:57,559
so there's different pieces of the
 

1293
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,230
so there's different pieces of the
puzzle that require different kinds of

1294
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
puzzle that require different kinds of
 

1295
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,470
puzzle that require different kinds of
cues so that's a big part of it too is

1296
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:03,480
cues so that's a big part of it too is
 

1297
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,149
cues so that's a big part of it too is
just this kind of what we call retrieval

1298
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:05,159
just this kind of what we call retrieval
 

1299
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,310
just this kind of what we call retrieval
failure you mentioned episodic memory

1300
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:07,320
failure you mentioned episodic memory
 

1301
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,029
failure you mentioned episodic memory
you mentioned semantic memory what are

1302
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,039
you mentioned semantic memory what are
 

1303
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,510
you mentioned semantic memory what are
the different separations here what's uh

1304
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
the different separations here what's uh
 

1305
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,430
the different separations here what's uh
working memory short-term memory

1306
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
working memory short-term memory
 

1307
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,669
working memory short-term memory
long-term memory what are the

1308
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:15,679
long-term memory what are the
 

1309
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,029
long-term memory what are the
interesting categories of memory yeah

1310
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:18,039
interesting categories of memory yeah
 

1311
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,669
interesting categories of memory yeah
and so memory researchers we love to cut

1312
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:20,679
and so memory researchers we love to cut
 

1313
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,470
and so memory researchers we love to cut
things up and say you know is memory one

1314
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:23,480
things up and say you know is memory one
 

1315
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,789
things up and say you know is memory one
thing or is it two things there's two

1316
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:24,799
thing or is it two things there's two
 

1317
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,870
thing or is it two things there's two
things or is three things and so one of

1318
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
things or is three things and so one of
 

1319
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,909
things or is three things and so one of
the things that there's value in that

1320
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
the things that there's value in that
 

1321
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,029
the things that there's value in that
and especially experimental value in

1322
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:32,039
and especially experimental value in
 

1323
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,310
and especially experimental value in
terms of being able to dissect thing in

1324
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:34,320
terms of being able to dissect thing in
 

1325
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,750
terms of being able to dissect thing in
the real world it's all connected speak

1326
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:36,760
the real world it's all connected speak
 

1327
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,029
the real world it's all connected speak
to your question working memory is a

1328
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
to your question working memory is a
 

1329
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,029
to your question working memory is a
term that was coined by Alan battley

1330
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
term that was coined by Alan battley
 

1331
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,110
term that was coined by Alan battley
it's basically thought to be this

1332
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,120
it's basically thought to be this
 

1333
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,110
it's basically thought to be this
ability to keep information online in

1334
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,120
ability to keep information online in
 

1335
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,590
ability to keep information online in
your mind right in front of you at a

1336
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
your mind right in front of you at a
 

1337
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,789
your mind right in front of you at a
given time and to be able to control the

1338
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:49,799
given time and to be able to control the
 

1339
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,909
given time and to be able to control the
flow of that information to choose what

1340
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:51,919
flow of that information to choose what
 

1341
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,029
flow of that information to choose what
information is relevant to be able to

1342
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:54,039
information is relevant to be able to
 

1343
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,070
information is relevant to be able to
manipulate it and so forth and one of

1344
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,080
manipulate it and so forth and one of
 

1345
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,430
manipulate it and so forth and one of
the things that Allan did that was was

1346
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,440
the things that Allan did that was was
 

1347
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,149
the things that Allan did that was was
quite brilliant was he said there's this

1348
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:01,159
quite brilliant was he said there's this
 

1349
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:02,950
quite brilliant was he said there's this
ability to kind of passively store

1350
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
ability to kind of passively store
 

1351
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,549
ability to kind of passively store
information you know see things in your

1352
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
information you know see things in your
 

1353
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,710
information you know see things in your
mind's eye or hear your internal

1354
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
mind's eye or hear your internal
 

1355
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,470
mind's eye or hear your internal
monologue but um you know we have that

1356
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:09,480
monologue but um you know we have that
 

1357
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,389
monologue but um you know we have that
ability to keep information in mind but

1358
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:12,399
ability to keep information in mind but
 

1359
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:14,190
ability to keep information in mind but
then we also have the separate what you

1360
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,200
then we also have the separate what you
 

1361
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,430
then we also have the separate what you
called an a central executive which is

1362
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
called an a central executive which is
 

1363
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,070
called an a central executive which is
identified a lot with the prefrontal

1364
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,080
identified a lot with the prefrontal
 

1365
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,950
identified a lot with the prefrontal
cortex it's this ability to control the

1366
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
cortex it's this ability to control the
 

1367
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,990
cortex it's this ability to control the
flow of information that's being kept

1368
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,000
flow of information that's being kept
 

1369
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,710
flow of information that's being kept
active based on what it is you're doing

1370
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:27,720
active based on what it is you're doing
 

1371
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,870
active based on what it is you're doing
now a lot of my early work was basically

1372
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:29,880
now a lot of my early work was basically
 

1373
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,710
now a lot of my early work was basically
saying that this working memory which

1374
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:31,720
saying that this working memory which
 

1375
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,149
saying that this working memory which
some memory researchers would call

1376
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:33,159
some memory researchers would call
 

1377
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:36,389
some memory researchers would call
short-term memory is not at all

1378
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,399
short-term memory is not at all
 

1379
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,310
short-term memory is not at all
independent from long-term memory that

1380
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
independent from long-term memory that
 

1381
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,070
independent from long-term memory that
is that a lot of executive function

1382
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:41,080
is that a lot of executive function
 

1383
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,950
is that a lot of executive function
requires learning and you have to have

1384
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
requires learning and you have to have
 

1385
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,029
requires learning and you have to have
like synaptic change for that to happen

1386
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
like synaptic change for that to happen
 

1387
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,750
like synaptic change for that to happen
and um but there's also transient forms

1388
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:47,760
and um but there's also transient forms
 

1389
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,710
and um but there's also transient forms
of memory so one of the things I've been

1390
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:49,720
of memory so one of the things I've been
 

1391
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,029
of memory so one of the things I've been
getting into lately is the idea that we

1392
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
getting into lately is the idea that we
 

1393
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,149
getting into lately is the idea that we
form internal models of events the

1394
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:57,159
form internal models of events the
 

1395
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,950
form internal models of events the
obvious one that I always us as birthday

1396
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:58,960
obvious one that I always us as birthday
 

1397
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,350
obvious one that I always us as birthday
parties right so you go to a child's

1398
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,360
parties right so you go to a child's
 

1399
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,590
parties right so you go to a child's
birthday party once the cake comes out

1400
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
birthday party once the cake comes out
 

1401
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,750
birthday party once the cake comes out
and they start you just see a candle You

1402
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
and they start you just see a candle You
 

1403
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,269
and they start you just see a candle You
can predict the whole frame you know set

1404
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:08,279
can predict the whole frame you know set
 

1405
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,669
can predict the whole frame you know set
of events that happens later and up till

1406
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:10,679
of events that happens later and up till
 

1407
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,310
of events that happens later and up till
that point where the child blows out the

1408
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
that point where the child blows out the
 

1409
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,350
that point where the child blows out the
candle you have an internal model in

1410
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,360
candle you have an internal model in
 

1411
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,029
candle you have an internal model in
your head of what's going on and so if

1412
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
your head of what's going on and so if
 

1413
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,630
your head of what's going on and so if
you follow people's eyes it's not

1414
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:18,640
you follow people's eyes it's not
 

1415
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,190
you follow people's eyes it's not
actually on what's happening it's going

1416
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,200
actually on what's happening it's going
 

1417
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,070
actually on what's happening it's going
where the action's about to happen um

1418
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,080
where the action's about to happen um
 

1419
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,310
where the action's about to happen um
which is just fascinating right so you

1420
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:24,320
which is just fascinating right so you
 

1421
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,269
which is just fascinating right so you
have this internal model and that's a

1422
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:26,279
have this internal model and that's a
 

1423
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,789
have this internal model and that's a
kind of a working memory product it's

1424
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
kind of a working memory product it's
 

1425
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,789
kind of a working memory product it's
something that you're keeping online

1426
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:30,799
something that you're keeping online
 

1427
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,389
something that you're keeping online
that's allowing you to interpret this

1428
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:32,399
that's allowing you to interpret this
 

1429
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,190
that's allowing you to interpret this
world around you now to build that model

1430
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
world around you now to build that model
 

1431
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,750
world around you now to build that model
though you need to pull out stuff from

1432
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:37,760
though you need to pull out stuff from
 

1433
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,430
though you need to pull out stuff from
uh your general knowledge of the world

1434
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
uh your general knowledge of the world
 

1435
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,590
uh your general knowledge of the world
which is what we call semantic memory

1436
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:41,600
which is what we call semantic memory
 

1437
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,430
which is what we call semantic memory
and then you'd want to be able to pull

1438
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
and then you'd want to be able to pull
 

1439
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,389
and then you'd want to be able to pull
out memories for specific events that

1440
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:45,399
out memories for specific events that
 

1441
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:46,950
out memories for specific events that
happen in the past which we call

1442
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:46,960
happen in the past which we call
 

1443
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,990
happen in the past which we call
episodic memory so in a way they're all

1444
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,000
episodic memory so in a way they're all
 

1445
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,509
episodic memory so in a way they're all
connected even though it's different um

1446
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:54,519
connected even though it's different um
 

1447
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:56,190
connected even though it's different um
the things that we're focusing on and

1448
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:56,200
the things that we're focusing on and
 

1449
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,110
the things that we're focusing on and
the way we organize information in the

1450
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,120
the way we organize information in the
 

1451
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,029
the way we organize information in the
present which is working memory will

1452
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,039
present which is working memory will
 

1453
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,990
present which is working memory will
play a big role in determining how we

1454
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,000
play a big role in determining how we
 

1455
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,710
play a big role in determining how we
remember that information later which

1456
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:03,720
remember that information later which
 

1457
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,430
remember that information later which
people typically call long-term memory

1458
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
people typically call long-term memory
 

1459
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,830
people typically call long-term memory
so if you have something like a a

1460
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:06,840
so if you have something like a a
 

1461
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,950
so if you have something like a a
birthday party and you've been to many

1462
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
birthday party and you've been to many
 

1463
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,110
birthday party and you've been to many
before you're going to load that from

1464
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:12,120
before you're going to load that from
 

1465
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,269
before you're going to load that from
dis into working memory this model and

1466
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:14,279
dis into working memory this model and
 

1467
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,710
dis into working memory this model and
then you're mostly operating on the

1468
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:15,720
then you're mostly operating on the
 

1469
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,149
then you're mostly operating on the
model and if it's a

1470
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
model and if it's a
 

1471
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,789
model and if it's a
new task you're you don't have a model

1472
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:22,799
new task you're you don't have a model
 

1473
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,669
new task you're you don't have a model
so you're more in the data collection

1474
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:24,679
so you're more in the data collection
 

1475
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,389
so you're more in the data collection
yeah one of the fascinating things that

1476
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
yeah one of the fascinating things that
 

1477
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,470
yeah one of the fascinating things that
we've been studying and this is we're

1478
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:28,480
we've been studying and this is we're
 

1479
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,750
we've been studying and this is we're
not at all the first to do this Jeff ZX

1480
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:30,760
not at all the first to do this Jeff ZX
 

1481
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,430
not at all the first to do this Jeff ZX
was a big Pioneer in this um and I've

1482
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
was a big Pioneer in this um and I've
 

1483
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,149
was a big Pioneer in this um and I've
been working with many other people Ken

1484
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:35,159
been working with many other people Ken
 

1485
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,350
been working with many other people Ken
Norman um Lea daachi NY or Colombia has

1486
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:38,360
Norman um Lea daachi NY or Colombia has
 

1487
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,669
Norman um Lea daachi NY or Colombia has
done some interesting stuff with this is

1488
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:40,679
done some interesting stuff with this is
 

1489
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,070
done some interesting stuff with this is
this idea that we form these internal

1490
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,080
this idea that we form these internal
 

1491
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,870
this idea that we form these internal
models at particular points of high

1492
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:45,880
models at particular points of high
 

1493
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,590
models at particular points of high
prediction error or points of I believe

1494
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:48,600
prediction error or points of I believe
 

1495
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,950
prediction error or points of I believe
also points of uncertainty points of

1496
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
also points of uncertainty points of
 

1497
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,190
also points of uncertainty points of
surprise or motivationally significant

1498
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
surprise or motivationally significant
 

1499
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,149
surprise or motivationally significant
periods and those points are when it's

1500
00:29:57,149 --> 00:29:57,159
periods and those points are when it's
 

1501
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,990
periods and those points are when it's
maximally op optimal to encode an

1502
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,000
maximally op optimal to encode an
 

1503
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,710
maximally op optimal to encode an
episodic memory so I used to think oh

1504
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:01,720
episodic memory so I used to think oh
 

1505
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,389
episodic memory so I used to think oh
well we're just encoding episodic

1506
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:03,399
well we're just encoding episodic
 

1507
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:05,350
well we're just encoding episodic
memories constantly boom boom boom boom

1508
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360
memories constantly boom boom boom boom
 

1509
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,750
memories constantly boom boom boom boom
boom but think about how much redundancy

1510
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:07,760
boom but think about how much redundancy
 

1511
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,350
boom but think about how much redundancy
there is in all that right it's just a

1512
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:10,360
there is in all that right it's just a
 

1513
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,350
there is in all that right it's just a
lot of information that you don't need

1514
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,360
lot of information that you don't need
 

1515
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,029
lot of information that you don't need
but if you capture an episodic memory at

1516
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:16,039
but if you capture an episodic memory at
 

1517
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,549
but if you capture an episodic memory at
the point of Maximum uncertainty for the

1518
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:19,559
the point of Maximum uncertainty for the
 

1519
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,350
the point of Maximum uncertainty for the
singular experience right you're just

1520
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
singular experience right you're just
 

1521
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,430
singular experience right you're just
it's only going to happen once but if

1522
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:23,440
it's only going to happen once but if
 

1523
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,990
it's only going to happen once but if
you capture it at the point of Maximum

1524
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,000
you capture it at the point of Maximum
 

1525
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,750
you capture it at the point of Maximum
uncertainty or maximum surprise you have

1526
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:27,760
uncertainty or maximum surprise you have
 

1527
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,350
uncertainty or maximum surprise you have
the most useful point in your experience

1528
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,360
the most useful point in your experience
 

1529
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,990
the most useful point in your experience
that you've grabbed and what we see is

1530
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,000
that you've grabbed and what we see is
 

1531
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,950
that you've grabbed and what we see is
that the hippocampus and these other

1532
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:35,960
that the hippocampus and these other
 

1533
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,710
that the hippocampus and these other
networks uh that are involved in

1534
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:37,720
networks uh that are involved in
 

1535
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,509
networks uh that are involved in
generating these internal models of

1536
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:39,519
generating these internal models of
 

1537
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,549
generating these internal models of
events they show a heighten period of

1538
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:42,559
events they show a heighten period of
 

1539
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,430
events they show a heighten period of
connectivity or correlated activity

1540
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:45,440
connectivity or correlated activity
 

1541
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,350
connectivity or correlated activity
during those breaks between different

00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,360
during those breaks between different
 

1543
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,389
during those breaks between different
events which we call event boundaries

1544
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:49,399
events which we call event boundaries
 

1545
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:50,549
events which we call event boundaries
these are the points where you're like

1546
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
these are the points where you're like
 

1547
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,070
these are the points where you're like
surprised or you cross from one room to

1548
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,080
surprised or you cross from one room to
 

1549
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,830
surprised or you cross from one room to
another and so forth and that

1550
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:54,840
another and so forth and that
 

1551
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,669
another and so forth and that
communication is associated with a bump

1552
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:56,679
communication is associated with a bump
 

1553
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,430
communication is associated with a bump
of activity in the hippocampus and

1554
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:58,440
of activity in the hippocampus and
 

1555
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,110
of activity in the hippocampus and
better memory and so

1556
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,120
better memory and so
 

1557
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,509
better memory and so
if people have a very good internal

1558
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:04,519
if people have a very good internal
 

1559
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,789
if people have a very good internal
model throughout that event you don't

1560
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
model throughout that event you don't
 

1561
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,230
model throughout that event you don't
need to do much memory processing you're

1562
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:09,240
need to do much memory processing you're
 

1563
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,590
need to do much memory processing you're
in a predictive mode right and so then

1564
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
in a predictive mode right and so then
 

1565
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,389
in a predictive mode right and so then
at these event boundaries you encode and

1566
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:13,399
at these event boundaries you encode and
 

1567
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:14,750
at these event boundaries you encode and
then you retrieve and you're like okay

1568
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:14,760
then you retrieve and you're like okay
 

1569
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,990
then you retrieve and you're like okay
wait a minute what's going on here ranat

1570
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,000
wait a minute what's going on here ranat
 

1571
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,870
wait a minute what's going on here ranat
now talking about orcas what's going on

1572
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:19,880
now talking about orcas what's going on
 

1573
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,070
now talking about orcas what's going on
and maybe you have to go back and

1574
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,080
and maybe you have to go back and
 

1575
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,870
and maybe you have to go back and
remember reading my book to pull out the

1576
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
remember reading my book to pull out the
 

1577
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,509
remember reading my book to pull out the
episodic memory to make sense of

1578
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:24,519
episodic memory to make sense of
 

1579
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,669
episodic memory to make sense of
whatever it is I'm babbling about right

1580
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:26,679
whatever it is I'm babbling about right
 

1581
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:29,350
whatever it is I'm babbling about right
and so there's this beauti dynamics that

1582
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
and so there's this beauti dynamics that
 

1583
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,070
and so there's this beauti dynamics that
you can see in the brain of these

1584
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
you can see in the brain of these
 

1585
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,789
you can see in the brain of these
different networks that are coming

1586
00:31:33,789 --> 00:31:33,799
different networks that are coming
 

1587
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:36,190
different networks that are coming
together and then deail a different

1588
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,200
together and then deail a different
 

1589
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,350
together and then deail a different
points in time that are allowing you to

1590
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:38,360
points in time that are allowing you to
 

1591
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,110
points in time that are allowing you to
go into these modes and so to speak to

1592
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
go into these modes and so to speak to
 

1593
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,350
go into these modes and so to speak to
your original question to some extent

1594
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,360
your original question to some extent
 

1595
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,190
your original question to some extent
when we're talking about semantic memory

1596
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:45,200
when we're talking about semantic memory
 

1597
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,350
when we're talking about semantic memory
and episodic memory and working memory

1598
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
and episodic memory and working memory
 

1599
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,909
and episodic memory and working memory
you can think about it as these

1600
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:48,919
you can think about it as these
 

1601
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:50,750
you can think about it as these
processes that are unfolding as these

1602
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:50,760
processes that are unfolding as these
 

1603
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,789
processes that are unfolding as these
networks kind of come together and Pull

Apart can memory be trained and improved

1606
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,080
Apart can memory be trained and improved

you've
described what aspect of it is a

on what your definition of optimal is so

1618
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
on what your definition of optimal is so
 

1619
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,070
on what your definition of optimal is so
what I say in the book is is that you

1620
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,080
what I say in the book is is that you
 

1621
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,710
what I say in the book is is that you
don't want to remember more you want to

1622
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:15,720
don't want to remember more you want to
 

1623
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,710
don't want to remember more you want to
remember better which means focusing on

1624
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
remember better which means focusing on
 

1625
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,430
remember better which means focusing on
the things that are important and that's

1626
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:20,440
the things that are important and that's
 

1627
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,830
the things that are important and that's
what our brains are designed to do so if

1628
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:22,840
what our brains are designed to do so if
 

1629
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,990
what our brains are designed to do so if
you go back to the earliest quantitative

1630
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,000
you go back to the earliest quantitative
 

1631
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,190
you go back to the earliest quantitative
studies in memory by ebing house what

1632
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,200
studies in memory by ebing house what
 

1633
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,350
studies in memory by ebing house what
you see is that he was trying so hard to

1634
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,360
you see is that he was trying so hard to
 

1635
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,029
you see is that he was trying so hard to
memorize this arbitrary nonsense and

1636
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,039
memorize this arbitrary nonsense and
 

1637
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,149
memorize this arbitrary nonsense and
within a day he lost about 60% of that

1638
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:36,159
within a day he lost about 60% of that
 

1639
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,190
within a day he lost about 60% of that
information and he was using he was

1640
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:38,200
information and he was using he was
 

1641
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,990
information and he was using he was
basically using a very very generous way

1642
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,000
basically using a very very generous way
 

1643
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,310
basically using a very very generous way
of measuring it right so as far as we

1644
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,320
of measuring it right so as far as we
 

1645
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,350
of measuring it right so as far as we
know nobody has managed to violate those

1646
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:46,360
know nobody has managed to violate those
 

1647
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,669
know nobody has managed to violate those
basics of having people forget you know

1648
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:48,679
basics of having people forget you know
 

1649
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,629
basics of having people forget you know
most of their experiences so if your

1650
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:50,639
most of their experiences so if your
 

1651
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:52,269
most of their experiences so if your
expectation is that you should remember

1652
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:52,279
expectation is that you should remember
 

1653
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,909
expectation is that you should remember
everything and that's what your optimal

1654
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:53,919
everything and that's what your optimal
 

1655
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,149
everything and that's what your optimal
is you're already off because that's

1656
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:56,159
is you're already off because that's
 

1657
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:57,549
is you're already off because that's
just not what human brains are designed

1658
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:57,559
just not what human brains are designed
 

1659
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,990
just not what human brains are designed
to do do on the other hand what we see

1660
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,000
to do do on the other hand what we see
 

1661
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,430
to do do on the other hand what we see
over and over again is that the brain

1662
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:02,440
over and over again is that the brain
 

1663
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,230
over and over again is that the brain
does basically one of the cool things

1664
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:05,240
does basically one of the cool things
 

1665
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,029
does basically one of the cool things
about the design of the brain is it's

1666
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
about the design of the brain is it's
 

1667
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,430
about the design of the brain is it's
always less is more less is more right

1668
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440
always less is more less is more right
 

1669
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,549
always less is more less is more right
it's like I mean I've seen estimates

1670
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:11,559
it's like I mean I've seen estimates
 

1671
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:13,310
it's like I mean I've seen estimates
that the human brain uses something like

1672
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:13,320
that the human brain uses something like
 

1673
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,870
that the human brain uses something like
12 to 20 watts you know in a day I mean

1674
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:15,880
12 to 20 watts you know in a day I mean
 

1675
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,549
12 to 20 watts you know in a day I mean
that's just nuts the low power

1676
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:17,559
that's just nuts the low power
 

1677
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,310
that's just nuts the low power
consumption right so it's all about

1678
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
consumption right so it's all about
 

1679
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,509
consumption right so it's all about
reusing information and and making the

1680
00:33:22,509 --> 00:33:22,519
reusing information and and making the
 

1681
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,750
reusing information and and making the
most of what we already have and so um

1682
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:26,760
most of what we already have and so um
 

1683
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,430
most of what we already have and so um
that's why basically again what you see

1684
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:29,440
that's why basically again what you see
 

1685
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,830
that's why basically again what you see
biologically is you know neuromodulators

1686
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:31,840
biologically is you know neuromodulators
 

1687
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,230
biologically is you know neuromodulators
for instance these chemicals in the

1688
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:33,240
for instance these chemicals in the
 

1689
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,549
for instance these chemicals in the
brain like neopine phrine dopamine uh

1690
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:36,559
brain like neopine phrine dopamine uh
 

1691
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,430
brain like neopine phrine dopamine uh
serotonin these are chemicals that are

1692
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:38,440
serotonin these are chemicals that are
 

1693
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,549
serotonin these are chemicals that are
released during moments that tend to be

1694
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:41,559
released during moments that tend to be
 

1695
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,789
released during moments that tend to be
biologically significant surprise fear

1696
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:44,799
biologically significant surprise fear
 

1697
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,789
biologically significant surprise fear
stress Etc and so these chemicals

1698
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
stress Etc and so these chemicals
 

1699
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,590
stress Etc and so these chemicals
promote lasting plasticity right

1700
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
promote lasting plasticity right
 

1701
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,389
promote lasting plasticity right
essentially some mechanisms by which the

1702
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:53,399
essentially some mechanisms by which the
 

1703
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:56,029
essentially some mechanisms by which the
brain can say prioritize the information

1704
00:33:56,029 --> 00:33:56,039
brain can say prioritize the information
 

1705
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,310
brain can say prioritize the information
that you carry with you into the future

1706
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
that you carry with you into the future
 

1707
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,590
that you carry with you into the future
attention is a big factor as well our

1708
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:00,600
attention is a big factor as well our
 

1709
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,230
attention is a big factor as well our
ability to focus our attention on what's

1710
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,240
ability to focus our attention on what's
 

1711
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,710
ability to focus our attention on what's
important and so uh there's different

1712
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:06,720
important and so uh there's different
 

1713
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,710
important and so uh there's different
schools of thought on training attention

1714
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:09,720
schools of thought on training attention
 

1715
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,270
schools of thought on training attention
for instance um uh so one of my

1716
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:12,280
for instance um uh so one of my
 

1717
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,349
for instance um uh so one of my

another one of my friends and colleagues

1732
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:30,639
another one of my friends and colleagues
 

1733
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,069
another one of my friends and colleagues
has work on kind of training through

1734
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:33,079
has work on kind of training through
 

1735
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,990
has work on kind of training through
video games actually as a way of

1736
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:35,000
video games actually as a way of
 

1737
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,669
video games actually as a way of
training attention and so uh it's not

1738
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:38,679
training attention and so uh it's not
 

1739
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,109
training attention and so uh it's not
clear to me you know one of the

1740
00:34:40,109 --> 00:34:40,119
clear to me you know one of the
 

1741
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,710
clear to me you know one of the
challenges though in training is you

1742
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:41,720
challenges though in training is you
 

1743
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,109
challenges though in training is you
tend to overfit to the thing that you're

1744
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:45,119
tend to overfit to the thing that you're
 

1745
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,710
tend to overfit to the thing that you're
trying to optimize right so you tend to

1746
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:47,720
trying to optimize right so you tend to
 

1747
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,869
trying to optimize right so you tend to
if I'm looking at a video game I can

1748
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
if I'm looking at a video game I can
 

1749
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,349
if I'm looking at a video game I can
definitely get better at paying

1750
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:52,359
definitely get better at paying
 

1751
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,710
definitely get better at paying
attention in the context of the video

1752
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:53,720
attention in the context of the video
 

1753
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,470
attention in the context of the video
game but you transfer it to the outside

1754
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:55,480
game but you transfer it to the outside
 

1755
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,150
game but you transfer it to the outside
world that's very controversial

1756
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160
world that's very controversial
 

1757
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,670
world that's very controversial
the implication there is that attention

1758
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:00,680
the implication there is that attention
 

1759
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,310
the implication there is that attention
is a fundamental component of

1760
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,320
is a fundamental component of
 

1761
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,270
is a fundamental component of
remembering something allocating

1762
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,280
remembering something allocating
 

1763
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,630
remembering something allocating
attention to it and then attention might

1764
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:06,640
attention to it and then attention might
 

1765
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,349
attention to it and then attention might
be something that you could train how

1766
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
be something that you could train how
 

1767
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,069
be something that you could train how
you allocate attention and how you hold

1768
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,079
you allocate attention and how you hold
 

1769
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,510
you allocate attention and how you hold
attention on a thing I can say that in

1770
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:14,520
attention on a thing I can say that in
 

1771
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,670
attention on a thing I can say that in
fact we do in certain ways right so if

1772
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,680
fact we do in certain ways right so if
 

1773
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,470
fact we do in certain ways right so if
you are an expert in something you are

1774
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:20,480
you are an expert in something you are
 

1775
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,790
you are an expert in something you are
training attention so we did this one

1776
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:22,800
training attention so we did this one
 

1777
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,470
training attention so we did this one
study of expertise in the brain and uh

1778
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,480
study of expertise in the brain and uh
 

1779
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,910
study of expertise in the brain and uh
you so people used to think say if

1780
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
you so people used to think say if
 

1781
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,470
you so people used to think say if
you're a bird expert or something right

1782
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:29,480
you're a bird expert or something right
 

1783
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,150
you're a bird expert or something right
people will go like if you get really

1784
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,160
people will go like if you get really
 

1785
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,950
people will go like if you get really
into this world of birds you start to

1786
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:33,960
into this world of birds you start to
 

1787
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,790
into this world of birds you start to
see the differences in your visual

1788
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:35,800
see the differences in your visual
 

1789
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,670
see the differences in your visual
cortex is tuned up and it's all about

researchers love to say everything's

1794
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,160
researchers love to say everything's
 

1795
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,950
researchers love to say everything's
visual you know but but it's like we did

1796
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:43,960
visual you know but but it's like we did
 

1797
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,430
visual you know but but it's like we did
the study of attention and working or E

1798
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:46,440
the study of attention and working or E
 

1799
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,030
the study of attention and working or E
working memory and expertise and one of

1800
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
working memory and expertise and one of
 

1801
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,430
working memory and expertise and one of
the things that surprised us were the

1802
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:50,440
the things that surprised us were the
 

1803
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,910
the things that surprised us were the
biggest effects as people became experts

1804
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:52,920
biggest effects as people became experts
 

1805
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,430
biggest effects as people became experts
in identifying these different kinds of

1806
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
in identifying these different kinds of
 

1807
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,990
in identifying these different kinds of
just crazy objects that we made up as

1808
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
just crazy objects that we made up as
 

1809
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,630
just crazy objects that we made up as
they develop this expertise of being

1810
00:35:59,630 --> 00:35:59,640
they develop this expertise of being
 

1811
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,069
they develop this expertise of being
able to identify what made them

1812
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:01,079
able to identify what made them
 

1813
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,630
able to identify what made them
different from each other and what made

1814
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:02,640
different from each other and what made
 

1815
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,349
different from each other and what made
them unique we were actually seeing

1816
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:04,359
them unique we were actually seeing
 

1817
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:06,069
them unique we were actually seeing
massive increases in activity in the

1818
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
massive increases in activity in the
 

1819
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,270
massive increases in activity in the
prefrontal cortex and this fits with

1820
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:08,280
prefrontal cortex and this fits with
 

1821
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,069
prefrontal cortex and this fits with
some of the studies of Chess experts and

1822
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:10,079
some of the studies of Chess experts and
 

1823
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,550
some of the studies of Chess experts and
so forth that it's not so much that you

1824
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:12,560
so forth that it's not so much that you
 

1825
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,390
so forth that it's not so much that you
learn the patterns passively you learn

1826
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:15,400
learn the patterns passively you learn
 

1827
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,670
learn the patterns passively you learn
what to look for you learn what's

1828
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:17,680
what to look for you learn what's
 

1829
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,589
what to look for you learn what's
important what's not right and you can

1830
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:19,599
important what's not right and you can
 

1831
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,349
important what's not right and you can
see this in any kind of expert

1832
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:22,359
see this in any kind of expert
 

1833
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:24,750
see this in any kind of expert
professional athlete they're looking

1834
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:24,760
professional athlete they're looking
 

1835
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,190
professional athlete they're looking
three steps ahead of where they're

1836
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,200
three steps ahead of where they're
 

1837
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,190
three steps ahead of where they're
supposed to be so that's kind of a

1838
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,200
supposed to be so that's kind of a
 

1839
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,630
supposed to be so that's kind of a
training of attention and those are also

1840
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:30,640
training of attention and those are also
 

1841
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,550
training of attention and those are also
what you'd call Expert memory skills so

1842
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:33,560
what you'd call Expert memory skills so
 

1843
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,390
what you'd call Expert memory skills so
um if you take the memory athletes I

1844
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:35,400
um if you take the memory athletes I
 

1845
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,510
um if you take the memory athletes I
know that's something we're both

1846
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:36,520
know that's something we're both
 

1847
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,190
know that's something we're both
interested in and you know so these are

1848
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,200
interested in and you know so these are
 

1849
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,349
interested in and you know so these are
people who train in these competitions

1850
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:40,359
people who train in these competitions
 

1851
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:42,069
people who train in these competitions
and they'll memorize like a deck of

1852
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079
and they'll memorize like a deck of
 

1853
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,950
and they'll memorize like a deck of
cards and like a really short amount of

1854
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:43,960
cards and like a really short amount of
 

1855
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,109
cards and like a really short amount of
time um there's a a great memory athlete

1856
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:48,119
time um there's a a great memory athlete
 

1857
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,870
time um there's a a great memory athlete
her name I think is pronounced yenya

1858
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
her name I think is pronounced yenya
 

1859
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,190
her name I think is pronounced yenya
winter soul but she uh so I think she's

1860
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,200
winter soul but she uh so I think she's
 

1861
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,790
winter soul but she uh so I think she's
got like a giant Instagram following and

1862
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:55,800
got like a giant Instagram following and
 

1863
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,510
got like a giant Instagram following and
so she had this YouTube video that went

1864
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:58,520
so she had this YouTube video that went
 

1865
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,230
so she had this YouTube video that went
um where she had memorized an entire

1866
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:00,240
um where she had memorized an entire
 

1867
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,030
um where she had memorized an entire
Ikea catalog right and so how do people

1868
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:04,040
Ikea catalog right and so how do people
 

1869
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,990
Ikea catalog right and so how do people
do this by all accounts from people who

1870
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:07,000
do this by all accounts from people who
 

1871
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,470
do this by all accounts from people who
become memory athletes they weren't born

1872
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:09,480
become memory athletes they weren't born
 

1873
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,910
become memory athletes they weren't born
with some extraordinary memory but they

1874
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920
with some extraordinary memory but they
 

1875
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,349
with some extraordinary memory but they
practic strategies over and over and

1876
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:14,359
practic strategies over and over and
 

1877
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,430
practic strategies over and over and
over again the strategy that they use

1878
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:16,440
over again the strategy that they use
 

1879
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,910
over again the strategy that they use
for memorizing a particular thing it can

1880
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:18,920
for memorizing a particular thing it can
 

1881
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,910
for memorizing a particular thing it can
become automatic and you can just deploy

1882
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:20,920
become automatic and you can just deploy
 

1883
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,150
become automatic and you can just deploy
it in an instant right so again it's not

1884
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,160
it in an instant right so again it's not
 

1885
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,150
it in an instant right so again it's not
necessarily going to one strategy for

1886
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160
necessarily going to one strategy for
 

1887
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,390
necessarily going to one strategy for
learning the order of a deck ofs cards

1888
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,400
learning the order of a deck ofs cards
 

1889
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,150
learning the order of a deck ofs cards
might not help you for something else

1890
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,160
might not help you for something else
 

1891
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,710
might not help you for something else
that you need like you know remembering

1892
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:31,720
that you need like you know remembering
 

1893
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,030
that you need like you know remembering
your way around Austin Texas but it's

1894
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
your way around Austin Texas but it's
 

1895
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,069
your way around Austin Texas but it's
going to be these whatever you're

1896
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:37,079
going to be these whatever you're
 

1897
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:39,470
going to be these whatever you're
interested in you can optimize for that

1898
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:39,480
interested in you can optimize for that
 

1899
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,990
interested in you can optimize for that
and that's just a natural byproduct of

1900
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,000
and that's just a natural byproduct of
 

1901
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,510
and that's just a natural byproduct of
expertise there's certain hacks there's

1902
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:44,520
expertise there's certain hacks there's
 

1903
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,030
expertise there's certain hacks there's
something called The Memory Palace that

1904
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,040
something called The Memory Palace that
 

1905
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,430
something called The Memory Palace that
I've played with I don't know if you're

1906
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,440
I've played with I don't know if you're
 

1907
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,870
I've played with I don't know if you're
familiar with that whole technique and

1908
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:49,880
familiar with that whole technique and
 

1909
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,510
familiar with that whole technique and
it works it's interesting so uh another

1910
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:53,520
it works it's interesting so uh another
 

1911
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,510
it works it's interesting so uh another
thing I recommend for people a lot is I

1912
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
thing I recommend for people a lot is I
 

1913
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,230
thing I recommend for people a lot is I
use anky a lot every day it's a app that

1914
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,240
use anky a lot every day it's a app that
 

1915
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,390
use anky a lot every day it's a app that
does space repetition so I think medical

1916
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
does space repetition so I think medical
 

1917
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,910
does space repetition so I think medical
students and like students use this a

1918
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:03,920
students and like students use this a
 

1919
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,230
students and like students use this a
lot to remember a lot of different

1920
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:05,240
lot to remember a lot of different
 

1921
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,190
lot to remember a lot of different
things oh yeah okay we can come back to

1922
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,200
things oh yeah okay we can come back to
 

1923
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,670
things oh yeah okay we can come back to
this but yeah sure it's the whole

1924
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:08,680
this but yeah sure it's the whole
 

1925
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,470
this but yeah sure it's the whole
concept of space repetition you just uh

1926
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:11,480
concept of space repetition you just uh
 

1927
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,790
concept of space repetition you just uh
when when the thing is fresh you kind of

1928
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:13,800
when when the thing is fresh you kind of
 

1929
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,990
when when the thing is fresh you kind of
have to remind yourself of it a lot and

1930
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,000
have to remind yourself of it a lot and
 

1931
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,150
have to remind yourself of it a lot and
then over time you can wait uh a week a

1932
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:20,160
then over time you can wait uh a week a
 

1933
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,030
then over time you can wait uh a week a
month a year before you have to recall

1934
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,040
month a year before you have to recall
 

1935
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,230
month a year before you have to recall
the thing again and that way you

1936
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:25,240
the thing again and that way you
 

1937
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,589
the thing again and that way you
essentially have something like note

1938
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:26,599
essentially have something like note
 

1939
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:29,670
essentially have something like note
cards the can have tens of thousands of

1940
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
cards the can have tens of thousands of
 

1941
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,150
cards the can have tens of thousands of
and can only spend 30 minutes a day and

1942
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,160
and can only spend 30 minutes a day and
 

1943
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,150
and can only spend 30 minutes a day and
actually be refreshing all of that

1944
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,160
actually be refreshing all of that
 

1945
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,910
actually be refreshing all of that
information all that knowledge it's

1946
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:35,920
information all that knowledge it's
 

1947
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,950
information all that knowledge it's
really great and then for uh Memory

1948
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:37,960
really great and then for uh Memory
 

1949
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,270
really great and then for uh Memory
Palace is a technique that allows you to

1950
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,280
Palace is a technique that allows you to
 

1951
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,150
Palace is a technique that allows you to
remember things like the Ikea catalog or

1952
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
remember things like the Ikea catalog or
 

1953
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,150
remember things like the Ikea catalog or
by placing them visually in a place that

1954
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,160
by placing them visually in a place that
 

1955
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,710
by placing them visually in a place that
you're really familiar with like I'm

1956
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
you're really familiar with like I'm
 

1957
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,870
you're really familiar with like I'm
really familiar with this place so I can

1958
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:50,880
really familiar with this place so I can
 

1959
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,910
really familiar with this place so I can
put uh uh numbers or facts or whatever

1960
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:54,920
put uh uh numbers or facts or whatever
 

1961
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,589
put uh uh numbers or facts or whatever
you want to remember you can walk along

1962
00:38:56,589 --> 00:38:56,599
you want to remember you can walk along
 

1963
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,390
you want to remember you can walk along
that little pal reminds you it's cool

1964
00:38:59,390 --> 00:38:59,400
that little pal reminds you it's cool
 

1965
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,710
that little pal reminds you it's cool
like there's stuff like that that I

1966
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:02,720
like there's stuff like that that I
 

1967
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,030
like there's stuff like that that I
think athletes memory athletes could use

1968
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:05,040
think athletes memory athletes could use
 

1969
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,069
think athletes memory athletes could use
but I think also regular people can use

1970
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:07,079
but I think also regular people can use
 

1971
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,069
but I think also regular people can use
one of the things I have to solve for

1972
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:09,079
one of the things I have to solve for
 

1973
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,390
one of the things I have to solve for
myself is how to remember names I'm

1974
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:11,400
myself is how to remember names I'm
 

1975
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,030
myself is how to remember names I'm
horrible at it yeah I think is because

1976
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,040
horrible at it yeah I think is because
 

1977
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,950
horrible at it yeah I think is because
when people introduce

1978
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:15,960
when people introduce
 

1979
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,950
when people introduce
themselves I have the the social anxiety

1980
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:19,960
themselves I have the the social anxiety
 

1981
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,750
themselves I have the the social anxiety
of the interaction where I'm like I know

1982
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:22,760
of the interaction where I'm like I know
 

1983
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,990
of the interaction where I'm like I know
I should be remembering that but I have

1984
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,000
I should be remembering that but I have
 

1985
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,309
I should be remembering that but I have
I'm freaking out internally about

1986
00:39:28,309 --> 00:39:28,319
I'm freaking out internally about
 

1987
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:30,630
I'm freaking out internally about
social interaction in general and so

1988
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,640
social interaction in general and so
 

1989
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,630
social interaction in general and so
therefore I forget immediately so I'm

1990
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:32,640
therefore I forget immediately so I'm
 

1991
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,150
therefore I forget immediately so I'm
looking for good tricks for that so uh

1992
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,160
looking for good tricks for that so uh
 

1993
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,550
looking for good tricks for that so uh
I'm I feel like we've got a lot in

1994
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:38,560
I'm I feel like we've got a lot in
 

1995
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,030
I'm I feel like we've got a lot in
common because when people introduce

1996
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,040
common because when people introduce
 

1997
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,030
common because when people introduce
themselves to me it's almost like I have

1998
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:43,040
themselves to me it's almost like I have
 

1999
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,109
themselves to me it's almost like I have
this like just blank blackout for a

2000
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:46,119
this like just blank blackout for a
 

2001
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,870
this like just blank blackout for a
moment and then I'm just looking at them

2002
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:47,880
moment and then I'm just looking at them
 

2003
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,950
moment and then I'm just looking at them
like what happened I look away or

2004
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:49,960
like what happened I look away or
 

2005
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,190
like what happened I look away or
something what's wrong with me yeah so I

2006
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:52,200
something what's wrong with me yeah so I
 

2007
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,190
something what's wrong with me yeah so I
mean I'm totally with you on this the

2008
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,200
mean I'm totally with you on this the
 

2009
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,589
mean I'm totally with you on this the
reason why it's hard is that there's no

2010
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:56,599
reason why it's hard is that there's no
 

2011
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:59,990
reason why it's hard is that there's no
reason should be able to remember names

2012
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,000
reason should be able to remember names
 

2013
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,630
reason should be able to remember names
because when you say remembering a name

2014
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:01,640
because when you say remembering a name
 

2015
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,069
because when you say remembering a name
you're not really remembering a name

2016
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:03,079
you're not really remembering a name
 

2017
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,589
you're not really remembering a name
maybe in my case you are but most of the

2018
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:04,599
maybe in my case you are but most of the
 

2019
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,630
maybe in my case you are but most of the
time you're associating a name with a

2020
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,640
time you're associating a name with a
 

2021
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,630
time you're associating a name with a
with a face and an identity and that's a

2022
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:09,640
with a face and an identity and that's a
 

2023
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,109
with a face and an identity and that's a
completely arbitrary thing right I mean

2024
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:12,119
completely arbitrary thing right I mean
 

2025
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:14,109
completely arbitrary thing right I mean
maybe in the olden days somebody named

2026
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:14,119
maybe in the olden days somebody named
 

2027
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,510
maybe in the olden days somebody named
Miller it's like they're actually making

2028
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,520
Miller it's like they're actually making
 

2029
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,829
Miller it's like they're actually making
flower or something like that but you

2030
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:17,839
flower or something like that but you
 

2031
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,349
flower or something like that but you
know for the most part it's like uh

2032
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:20,359
know for the most part it's like uh
 

2033
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:22,390
know for the most part it's like uh
these names are just utterly arbitrary

2034
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:22,400
these names are just utterly arbitrary
 

2035
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,430
these names are just utterly arbitrary
so you have no thing to latch on to and

2036
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
so you have no thing to latch on to and
 

2037
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,030
so you have no thing to latch on to and
so it's not really a thing that our

2038
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,040
so it's not really a thing that our
 

2039
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,109
so it's not really a thing that our
brain does very well to learn

2040
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:29,119
brain does very well to learn
 

2041
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,630
brain does very well to learn
meaningless arbitrary stuff so what you

2042
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:31,640
meaningless arbitrary stuff so what you
 

2043
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,470
meaningless arbitrary stuff so what you
need to do is build connection somehow

2044
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:35,480
need to do is build connection somehow
 

2045
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,470
need to do is build connection somehow
visualize a connection and sometimes

2046
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:37,480
visualize a connection and sometimes
 

2047
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,829
visualize a connection and sometimes
it's it's obvious or sometimes it's not

2048
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:40,839
it's it's obvious or sometimes it's not
 

2049
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,309
it's it's obvious or sometimes it's not
I'm trying to think of a good one for

2050
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:42,319
I'm trying to think of a good one for
 

2051
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,829
I'm trying to think of a good one for
you now but the first thing I think of

2052
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:43,839
you now but the first thing I think of
 

2053
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,270
you now but the first thing I think of
is Lex Luthor but yeah so I Le doesn't

2054
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,280
is Lex Luthor but yeah so I Le doesn't
 

2055
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,510
is Lex Luthor but yeah so I Le doesn't
Lex Luthor wear a a suit I think I I

2056
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:50,520
Lex Luthor wear a a suit I think I I
 

2057
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,990
Lex Luthor wear a a suit I think I I
know he has a shaved head though he's

2058
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:53,000
know he has a shaved head though he's
 

2059
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,670
know he has a shaved head though he's
bald which you're not you got a great

2060
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:54,680
bald which you're not you got a great
 

2061
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,670
bald which you're not you got a great
head if I trade hair with you any day

2062
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:56,680
head if I trade hair with you any day
 

2063
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,710
head if I trade hair with you any day
but but like you know but something like

2064
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:58,720
but but like you know but something like
 

2065
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,630
but but like you know but something like
that but if I can come up with something

2066
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:00,640
that but if I can come up with something
 

2067
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,870
that but if I can come up with something
like I could say okay so Lex Luther is

2068
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
like I could say okay so Lex Luther is
 

2069
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,630
like I could say okay so Lex Luther is
this criminal mastermind and then I just

2070
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:04,640
this criminal mastermind and then I just
 

2071
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,430
this criminal mastermind and then I just
imagine you talked about stabbing or

2072
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:06,440
imagine you talked about stabbing or
 

2073
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,510
imagine you talked about stabbing or
whatever

2074
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
whatever
 

2075
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,829
whatever
earlier kind of connected and that's it

2076
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:09,839
earlier kind of connected and that's it
 

2077
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,990
earlier kind of connected and that's it
yeah yeah and I but I'm serious though

2078
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
yeah yeah and I but I'm serious though
 

2079
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,230
yeah yeah and I but I'm serious though
that these kinds of weird associations

2080
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:14,240
that these kinds of weird associations
 

2081
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,349
that these kinds of weird associations
now building a richer Network I mean one

2082
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:16,359
now building a richer Network I mean one
 

2083
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:19,109
now building a richer Network I mean one
of the things that I find is if I've

2084
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:19,119
of the things that I find is if I've
 

2085
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,870
of the things that I find is if I've
like you can have somebody's name that's

2086
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880
like you can have somebody's name that's
 

2087
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,309
like you can have somebody's name that's
just totally generic like John Smith or

2088
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:23,319
just totally generic like John Smith or
 

2089
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,470
just totally generic like John Smith or
something not that no offense to people

2090
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:25,480
something not that no offense to people
 

2091
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,069
something not that no offense to people
that that name but you know I if I see a

2092
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
that that name but you know I if I see a
 

2093
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,470
that that name but you know I if I see a
generic name like that but I've read

2094
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,480
generic name like that but I've read
 

2095
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,990
generic name like that but I've read
John Smith's papers academically and

2096
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,000
John Smith's papers academically and
 

2097
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,550
John Smith's papers academically and
then I meet John Smith at a conference I

2098
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:35,560
then I meet John Smith at a conference I
 

2099
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,430
then I meet John Smith at a conference I
can immediately associate that name with

2100
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
can immediately associate that name with
 

2101
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,550
can immediately associate that name with
that face because I have this

2102
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:38,560
that face because I have this
 

2103
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,750
that face because I have this
pre-existing Network to lock everything

2104
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:40,760
pre-existing Network to lock everything
 

2105
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,030
pre-existing Network to lock everything
into right and so you can build that

2106
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,040
into right and so you can build that
 

2107
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,710
into right and so you can build that
Network and that's what the method of

2108
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:44,720
Network and that's what the method of
 

2109
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,790
Network and that's what the method of
loai or the Memory Palace technique is

2110
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
loai or the Memory Palace technique is
 

2111
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,270
loai or the Memory Palace technique is
all about is you have a pre-existing

2112
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
all about is you have a pre-existing
 

2113
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,470
all about is you have a pre-existing
structure in your head of like your

2114
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:51,480
structure in your head of like your
 

2115
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,109
structure in your head of like your
childhood home or this mental Palace

2116
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:54,119
childhood home or this mental Palace
 

2117
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,870
childhood home or this mental Palace
that you've created for yourself and so

2118
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:56,880
that you've created for yourself and so
 

2119
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,150
that you've created for yourself and so
now you can put arbitrary pieces of

2120
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,160
now you can put arbitrary pieces of
 

2121
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,470
now you can put arbitrary pieces of
information in different locations in

2122
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:02,480
information in different locations in
 

2123
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,910
information in different locations in
that mental structure of yours and then

2124
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:04,920
that mental structure of yours and then
 

2125
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,470
that mental structure of yours and then
you can walk through the different path

2126
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:07,480
you can walk through the different path
 

2127
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,430
you can walk through the different path
and find all the pieces of information

2128
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
and find all the pieces of information
 

2129
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,630
and find all the pieces of information
you're looking for so the method of Loi

2130
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:11,640
you're looking for so the method of Loi
 

2131
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,510
you're looking for so the method of Loi
is a great method for just learning

2132
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
is a great method for just learning
 

2133
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,230
is a great method for just learning
arbitrary things because it allows you

2134
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:16,240
arbitrary things because it allows you
 

2135
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,470
arbitrary things because it allows you
to link them together and get that cue

2136
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:18,480
to link them together and get that cue
 

2137
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,349
to link them together and get that cue
that you need to pop in and find

2138
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
that you need to pop in and find
 

2139
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,390
that you need to pop in and find
everything right we should maybe Linger

2140
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,400
everything right we should maybe Linger
 

2141
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,829
everything right we should maybe Linger
on this Memory Palace thing just to make

2142
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:27,839
on this Memory Palace thing just to make
 

2143
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,910
on this Memory Palace thing just to make
obvious cuz when people were describing

2144
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:29,920
obvious cuz when people were describing
 

2145
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,990
obvious cuz when people were describing
to me a while ago what this is it seems

2146
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,000
to me a while ago what this is it seems
 

2147
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,230
to me a while ago what this is it seems
insane I just you literally think of a

2148
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,240
insane I just you literally think of a
 

2149
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,270
insane I just you literally think of a
place like a childhood home or a home

2150
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280
place like a childhood home or a home
 

2151
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,150
place like a childhood home or a home
that you're really

2152
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,160
that you're really
 

2153
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,190
that you're really
visually uh familiar with and you

2154
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,200
visually uh familiar with and you
 

2155
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,790
visually uh familiar with and you
literally place in that

2156
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:48,800
literally place in that
 

2157
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,589
literally place in that
three-dimensional space facts or people

2158
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:52,599
three-dimensional space facts or people
 

2159
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,069
three-dimensional space facts or people
or whatever you want to remember and you

2160
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:55,079
or whatever you want to remember and you
 

2161
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:57,870
or whatever you want to remember and you
just walk in your mind

2162
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:57,880
just walk in your mind
 

2163
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,390
just walk in your mind
along that place visually and you can

2164
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:01,400
along that place visually and you can
 

2165
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,589
along that place visually and you can
remember uh remind yourself of the

2166
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
remember uh remind yourself of the
 

2167
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,510
remember uh remind yourself of the
different things one of the limitations

2168
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520
different things one of the limitations
 

2169
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,510
different things one of the limitations
is there is a sequence to it m so it's I

2170
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:08,520
is there is a sequence to it m so it's I
 

2171
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,470
is there is a sequence to it m so it's I
think your brain somehow you need you

2172
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,480
think your brain somehow you need you
 

2173
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,270
think your brain somehow you need you
can't just like go upstairs right away

2174
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:12,280
can't just like go upstairs right away
 

2175
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,790
can't just like go upstairs right away
or something you have to like walk along

2176
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:13,800
or something you have to like walk along
 

2177
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,829
or something you have to like walk along
the the room so it's really great for

2178
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
the the room so it's really great for
 

2179
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,630
the the room so it's really great for
remembering sequences but it's also not

2180
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:17,640
remembering sequences but it's also not
 

2181
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,670
remembering sequences but it's also not
great for remembering like individual

evolved from this like kind of knowledge
 

2289
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:21,829
evolved from this like kind of knowledge
of space and you know basically this

2290
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
of space and you know basically this
 

2291
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,470

primitive abilities to figure out where
 

2293
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,430
primitive abilities to figure out where
you are and so people explain the method

2294
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
you are and so people explain the method
 

2295
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,750
you are and so people explain the method
Loi that way and and you know whether or

2296

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,150
you it's just I saw it on a TV show you
know uh so what you mentioned space

2336
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:13,160
know uh so what you mentioned space
 

2337
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,710
know uh so what you mentioned space
repetition so what um do you like this

2338
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:15,720
repetition so what um do you like this
 

2339
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,069
repetition so what um do you like this
process maybe can you explain it oh yeah

2340
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
process maybe can you explain it oh yeah
 

2341
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,750
process maybe can you explain it oh yeah
if I'm trying to memorize something

2342
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:19,760
if I'm trying to memorize something
 

2343
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,109
if I'm trying to memorize something
let's say if I have an hour to memorize

2344
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:22,119
let's say if I have an hour to memorize
 

2345
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:25,190
let's say if I have an hour to memorize
as many Spanish words as I can if I just

2346
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:25,200
as many Spanish words as I can if I just
 

2347
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,589
as many Spanish words as I can if I just
try to do like half an hour tomorrow and

2348
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:27,599
try to do like half an hour tomorrow and
 

2349
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,349
try to do like half an hour tomorrow and
then I later in the day I do half an

2350
00:46:29,349 --> 00:46:29,359
then I later in the day I do half an
 

2351
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,190
then I later in the day I do half an
hour I won't retain that information as

2352
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:32,200
hour I won't retain that information as
 

2353
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,030
hour I won't retain that information as
long as if I do half an hour today and

2354
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
long as if I do half an hour today and
 

2355
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,910
long as if I do half an hour today and
half an hour one week from now and so

2356
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:37,920
half an hour one week from now and so
 

2357
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,829
half an hour one week from now and so
doing that extra spacing should help me

2358
00:46:40,829 --> 00:46:40,839
doing that extra spacing should help me
 

2359
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,990
doing that extra spacing should help me
retain the information better now

2360
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:43,000
retain the information better now
 

2361
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,870
retain the information better now
there's a interesting boundary condition

2362
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:45,880
there's a interesting boundary condition
 

2363
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,870
there's a interesting boundary condition
which is it depends on when you need

2364
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:47,880
which is it depends on when you need
 

2365
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,950
which is it depends on when you need
that information so many of us you know

2366
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:50,960
that information so many of us you know
 

2367
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,150
that information so many of us you know
for me like I I can't remember so much

2368
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:53,160
for me like I I can't remember so much
 

2369
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,750
for me like I I can't remember so much
from college and high school cuz I

2370
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:54,760
from college and high school cuz I
 

2371
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,430
from college and high school cuz I
crammed cuz I just did everything at the

2372
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:56,440
crammed cuz I just did everything at the
 

2373
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,630
crammed cuz I just did everything at the
last minute

2374
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:57,640
last minute
 

2375
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,750
last minute
and sometimes I would literally study

2376
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:00,760
and sometimes I would literally study
 

2377
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,270
and sometimes I would literally study
like you know in the hallway right

2378
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:02,280
like you know in the hallway right
 

2379
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,309
like you know in the hallway right
before the test that was great because

2380
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:05,319
before the test that was great because
 

2381
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:07,150
before the test that was great because
what would happen is is I just had that

2382
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:07,160
what would happen is is I just had that
 

2383
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,109
what would happen is is I just had that
information right there and so actually

2384
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:10,119
information right there and so actually
 

2385
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,630
information right there and so actually
not spacing can really help you if you

2386
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:12,640
not spacing can really help you if you
 

2387
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,190
not spacing can really help you if you
need it very quickly right but the

2388
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:15,200
need it very quickly right but the
 

2389
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,069
need it very quickly right but the
problem is is that you tend to forget it

2390
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:17,079
problem is is that you tend to forget it
 

2391
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:19,309
problem is is that you tend to forget it
later on but on the other hand if you

2392
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:19,319
later on but on the other hand if you
 

2393
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:21,910
later on but on the other hand if you
space things out you get a benefit for

2394
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:21,920
space things out you get a benefit for
 

2395
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,910
space things out you get a benefit for
later on retention and so there's many

2396
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
later on retention and so there's many
 

2397
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,630
later on retention and so there's many
different explanations we have a

2398
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:27,640
different explanations we have a
 

2399
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,190
different explanations we have a
computational model of this it's

2400
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:29,200
computational model of this it's
 

2401
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,870
computational model of this it's
currently under revision um but in our

2402
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:31,880
currently under revision um but in our
 

2403
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,710
currently under revision um but in our
computer model what we say is is that an

2404
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:34,720
computer model what we say is is that an
 

2405
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,470
computer model what we say is is that an
easy maybe a good way of thinking about

2406
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:36,480
easy maybe a good way of thinking about
 

2407
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,270
easy maybe a good way of thinking about
this is this conversation that you and I

2408
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:39,280
this is this conversation that you and I
 

2409
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:41,549
this is this conversation that you and I
are having It's associated with a

2410
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:41,559
are having It's associated with a
 

2411
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:44,230
are having It's associated with a
particular context a particular place in

2412
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:44,240
particular context a particular place in
 

2413
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,750
particular context a particular place in
time and so all these little cues that

2414
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:46,760
time and so all these little cues that
 

2415
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,230
time and so all these little cues that
are in the background these little

2416
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
are in the background these little
 

2417
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,549
are in the background these little
guitar sculptures that you have and that

2418
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:50,559
guitar sculptures that you have and that
 

2419
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,510
guitar sculptures that you have and that
big light umbrella thing right all these

2420
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:52,520
big light umbrella thing right all these
 

2421
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,230
big light umbrella thing right all these
things are part of my memory for what

2422
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:54,240
things are part of my memory for what
 

2423
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,589
things are part of my memory for what
we're talking about the content so

2424
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
we're talking about the content so
 

2425
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,470
we're talking about the content so
now later on you're sitting around and

2426
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
now later on you're sitting around and
 

2427
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,150
now later on you're sitting around and
you're at home drinking a beer and

2428
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,160
you're at home drinking a beer and
 

2429
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,349
you're at home drinking a beer and
you're thinking God what a strange

2430
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
you're thinking God what a strange
 

2431
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,870
you're thinking God what a strange
interview that was right so now you're

2432
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:05,880
interview that was right so now you're
 

2433
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,910
interview that was right so now you're
trying to remember it but the context is

2434
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:07,920
trying to remember it but the context is
 

2435
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,069
trying to remember it but the context is
different so your current situation

2436
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:12,079
different so your current situation
 

2437
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,630
different so your current situation
doesn't match up with the memory that

2438
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:13,640
doesn't match up with the memory that
 

2439
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,870
doesn't match up with the memory that
you pulled up there's error there's a

2440
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:15,880
you pulled up there's error there's a
 

2441
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,430
you pulled up there's error there's a
mismatch between what you pulled up and

2442
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:18,440
mismatch between what you pulled up and
 

2443
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,990
mismatch between what you pulled up and
your current context and so in our model

2444
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:21,000
your current context and so in our model
 

2445
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,270
your current context and so in our model
what you start to do is you start to

2446
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:23,280
what you start to do is you start to
 

2447
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,790
what you start to do is you start to
erase or alter the parts of the memory

2448
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:25,800
erase or alter the parts of the memory
 

2449
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,309
erase or alter the parts of the memory
that are associated with the specific

2450
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:27,319
that are associated with the specific
 

2451
00:48:27,319 --> 00:48:29,990
that are associated with the specific
place and time and you heighten the

2452
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:30,000
place and time and you heighten the
 

2453
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,150
place and time and you heighten the
information about the content and so if

2454
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:33,160
information about the content and so if
 

2455
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,069
information about the content and so if
you remember this information in

2456
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:35,079
you remember this information in
 

2457
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,390
you remember this information in
different times and different places

2458
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:37,400
different times and different places
 

2459
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,030
different times and different places
it's more accessible at different times

2460
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:40,040
it's more accessible at different times
 

2461
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,750
it's more accessible at different times
and different places because it's not

2462
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,760
and different places because it's not
 

2463
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,990
and different places because it's not
overfitted in a in an AI kind of way of

2464
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:45,000
overfitted in a in an AI kind of way of
 

2465
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,790
overfitted in a in an AI kind of way of
thinking about things it's not

2466
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:45,800
thinking about things it's not
 

2467
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,069
thinking about things it's not
overfitted to one particular context but

2468
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:48,079
overfitted to one particular context but
 

2469
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,589
overfitted to one particular context but
that's also why the memories that we

2470
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:49,599
that's also why the memories that we
 

2471
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,829
that's also why the memories that we
call upon the most also feel kind of

2472
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:52,839
call upon the most also feel kind of
 

2473
00:48:52,839 --> 00:48:54,270
call upon the most also feel kind of
like they're just things that we read

2474
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:54,280
like they're just things that we read
 

2475
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,549
like they're just things that we read
about almost you don't vividly reimagine

2476
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:56,559
about almost you don't vividly reimagine
 

2477
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,030
about almost you don't vividly reimagine
them right it's like they're just these

2478
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:58,040
them right it's like they're just these
 

2479
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,589
them right it's like they're just these
things that just come to us like facts

2480
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:00,599
things that just come to us like facts
 

2481
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,510
things that just come to us like facts
right yeah and it's a little bit

2482
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:02,520
right yeah and it's a little bit
 

2483
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,109
right yeah and it's a little bit
different than semantic memory but it's

2484
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:04,119
different than semantic memory but it's
 

2485
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:06,670
different than semantic memory but it's
like basically the these events that we

2486
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:06,680
like basically the these events that we
 

2487
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,990
like basically the these events that we
have recalled every you know over and

2488
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:09,000
have recalled every you know over and
 

2489
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,230
have recalled every you know over and
over and over again we keep updating

2490
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:11,240
over and over again we keep updating
 

2491
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,109
over and over again we keep updating
that memory so it's less and less tied

2492
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:13,119
that memory so it's less and less tied
 

2493
00:49:13,119 --> 00:49:15,270
that memory so it's less and less tied
to the original experience but then we

2494
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:15,280
to the original experience but then we
 

2495
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,829
to the original experience but then we
have those other ones which it's like

2496
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:16,839
have those other ones which it's like
 

2497
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:18,870
have those other ones which it's like
you just get a reminder of that very

2498
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:18,880
you just get a reminder of that very
 

2499
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,670
you just get a reminder of that very
specific context you smell something you

2500
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:21,680
specific context you smell something you
 

2501
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,109
specific context you smell something you
hear a song you see a place that you

2502
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:24,119
hear a song you see a place that you
 

2503
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,109
hear a song you see a place that you
haven't been to in a while and boom it

2504
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:26,119
haven't been to in a while and boom it
 

2505
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:27,870
haven't been to in a while and boom it
just comes back back to you and that's

2506
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:27,880
just comes back back to you and that's
 

2507
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,549
just comes back back to you and that's
the exact opposite of what you get with

2508
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:29,559
the exact opposite of what you get with
 

2509
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:32,109
the exact opposite of what you get with
spacing right that's so fascinating so

2510
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:32,119
spacing right that's so fascinating so
 

2511
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:34,190
spacing right that's so fascinating so
with space repetition one of its powers

2512
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:34,200
with space repetition one of its powers
 

2513
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,829
with space repetition one of its powers
is that you lose attachment to a

2514
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:35,839
is that you lose attachment to a
 

2515
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,390
is that you lose attachment to a
particular

2516
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:37,400
particular
 

2517
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,789
particular
context but then it

2518
00:49:39,789 --> 00:49:39,799
context but then it
 

2519
00:49:39,799 --> 00:49:43,510
context but then it
loses the the intensity of the flavor of

2520
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:43,520
loses the the intensity of the flavor of
 

2521
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,670
loses the the intensity of the flavor of
the memory MH that's interesting that's

2522
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:46,680
the memory MH that's interesting that's
 

2523
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,549
the memory MH that's interesting that's
so interesting yeah but you know at the

2524
00:49:48,549 --> 00:49:48,559
so interesting yeah but you know at the
 

2525
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,309
so interesting yeah but you know at the
same time it becomes stronger in the

2526
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
same time it becomes stronger in the
 

2527
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,309
same time it becomes stronger in the
sense that the content becomes stronger

2528
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:52,319
sense that the content becomes stronger
 

2529
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,309
sense that the content becomes stronger
yeah so it's used for uh for learning

2530
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
yeah so it's used for uh for learning
 

2531
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,670
yeah so it's used for uh for learning
languages for learning facts for

2532
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
languages for learning facts for
 

2533
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,069
languages for learning facts for
learning for you know for that generic

2534
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:58,079
learning for you know for that generic
 

2535
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,069
learning for you know for that generic
semantic information type of memories

2536
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:00,079
semantic information type of memories
 

2537
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:01,710
semantic information type of memories
yeah and and I think this this falls

2538
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:01,720
yeah and and I think this this falls
 

2539
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,670
yeah and and I think this this falls
into a category we've done other

2540
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:03,680
into a category we've done other
 

2541
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,710
into a category we've done other
modeling um one of these is a published

2542
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:05,720
modeling um one of these is a published
 

2543
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,470
modeling um one of these is a published
study in pla computational biology where

2544
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:08,480
study in pla computational biology where
 

2545
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,390
study in pla computational biology where
we showed that uh another way which is I

2546
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:12,400
we showed that uh another way which is I
 

2547
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,789
we showed that uh another way which is I
think related to the spacing effect is

2548
00:50:14,789 --> 00:50:14,799
think related to the spacing effect is
 

2549
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:17,309
think related to the spacing effect is
What's called the testing effect so uh

2550
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:17,319
What's called the testing effect so uh
 

2551
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:18,750
What's called the testing effect so uh
the idea is is that if you're trying to

2552
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:18,760
the idea is is that if you're trying to
 

2553
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,670
the idea is is that if you're trying to
learn words uh let's say in Spanish or

2554
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
learn words uh let's say in Spanish or
 

2555
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,030
learn words uh let's say in Spanish or
something like that and this doesn't

2556
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:23,040
something like that and this doesn't
 

2557
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,150
something like that and this doesn't
have to be words it could be anything

2558
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:25,160
have to be words it could be anything
 

2559
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,109
have to be words it could be anything
you test yourself on the words and that

2560
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:28,119
you test yourself on the words and that
 

2561
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,190
you test yourself on the words and that
act of testing yourself helps you retain

2562
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:30,200
act of testing yourself helps you retain
 

2563
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,309
act of testing yourself helps you retain
it better over time than if you just

2564
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:32,319
it better over time than if you just
 

2565
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,710
it better over time than if you just
studied it right and

2566
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:34,720
studied it right and
 

2567
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,870
studied it right and
so from traditional learning theories

2568
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:37,880
so from traditional learning theories
 

2569
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,630
so from traditional learning theories
some learning theories anyway this seems

2570
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:39,640
some learning theories anyway this seems
 

2571
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,109
some learning theories anyway this seems
weird why would you do better giving

2572
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:42,119
weird why would you do better giving
 

2573
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,750
weird why would you do better giving
yourself this extra error from testing

2574
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:44,760
yourself this extra error from testing
 

2575
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,910
yourself this extra error from testing
yourself rather than just you know

2576
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:46,920
yourself rather than just you know
 

2577
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,870
yourself rather than just you know
giving yourself perfect input that's a

2578
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:48,880
giving yourself perfect input that's a
 

2579
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,910
giving yourself perfect input that's a
replica of what it is that you're trying

2580
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:50,920
replica of what it is that you're trying
 

2581
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,190
replica of what it is that you're trying
to learn and I think the reason is is

2582
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:53,200
to learn and I think the reason is is
 

2583
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,230
to learn and I think the reason is is
that you get better retention from that

2584
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:56,240
that you get better retention from that
 

2585
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,510
that you get better retention from that
error that mismatch that we talked about

2586
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:58,520
error that mismatch that we talked about
 

2587
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,870
error that mismatch that we talked about
right so what's happening in our model

2588
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
right so what's happening in our model
 

2589
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,710
right so what's happening in our model
it's actually conceptually kind of

2590
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:02,720
it's actually conceptually kind of
 

2591
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,510
it's actually conceptually kind of
similar to what happens with back propop

2592
00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:04,520
similar to what happens with back propop
 

2593
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,750
similar to what happens with back propop
in uh AI so or neural networks and so

2594
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:07,760
in uh AI so or neural networks and so
 

2595
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,390
in uh AI so or neural networks and so
the idea is is that you expose here's

2596
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:10,400
the idea is is that you expose here's
 

2597
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,910
the idea is is that you expose here's
the bad connections and here's the good

2598
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:12,920
the bad connections and here's the good
 

2599
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,030
the bad connections and here's the good
connections and so we can keep the the

2600
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:16,040
connections and so we can keep the the
 

2601
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,789
connections and so we can keep the the
parts of the cell assembly that are good

2602
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:17,799
parts of the cell assembly that are good
 

2603
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:19,349
parts of the cell assembly that are good
for the memory and lose the ones that

2604
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:19,359
for the memory and lose the ones that
 

2605
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:21,910
for the memory and lose the ones that
are not so good but if you don't stress

2606
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:21,920
are not so good but if you don't stress
 

2607
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,829
are not so good but if you don't stress
test the memory you haven't exposed it

2608
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:23,839
test the memory you haven't exposed it
 

2609
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:26,990
test the memory you haven't exposed it
to the error fully and so that's why I

2610
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:27,000
to the error fully and so that's why I
 

2611
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,549
to the error fully and so that's why I
think this is kind of this is a thing

2612
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:28,559
think this is kind of this is a thing
 

2613
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:30,230
think this is kind of this is a thing
that I come back to over and over again

2614
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,240
that I come back to over and over again
 

2615
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,309
that I come back to over and over again
is that you will retain information

2616
00:51:33,309 --> 00:51:33,319
is that you will retain information
 

2617
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:35,710
is that you will retain information
better if you're constantly pushing

2618
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:35,720
better if you're constantly pushing
 

2619
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,309
better if you're constantly pushing
yourself to your limit right if you are

2620
00:51:39,309 --> 00:51:39,319
yourself to your limit right if you are
 

2621
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:42,030
yourself to your limit right if you are
feeling like you're coasting then you're

2622
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:42,040
feeling like you're coasting then you're
 

2623
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,670
feeling like you're coasting then you're
actually not learning so it's like

2624
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:45,680
actually not learning so it's like
 

2625
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,589
actually not learning so it's like
always you should always be stress

2626
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:47,599
always you should always be stress
 

2627
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,870
always you should always be stress
testing the memory system yeah and feel

2628
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:50,880
testing the memory system yeah and feel
 

2629
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,510
testing the memory system yeah and feel
good about it you know even though

2630
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:52,520
good about it you know even though
 

2631
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,309
good about it you know even though
everyone tells me oh my memory is

2632
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:54,319
everyone tells me oh my memory is
 

2633
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,630
everyone tells me oh my memory is
terrible in the moment they're over

2634
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:56,640
terrible in the moment they're over
 

2635
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,190
terrible in the moment they're over
confident about what they'll retain

2636
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:58,200
confident about what they'll retain
 

2637
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,270
confident about what they'll retain
later on so it it's fascinating and so

2638
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
later on so it it's fascinating and so
 

2639
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,710
later on so it it's fascinating and so
what happens is when you test yourself

2640
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:03,720
what happens is when you test yourself
 

2641
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,349
what happens is when you test yourself
you're like oh my God I thought I knew

2642
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
you're like oh my God I thought I knew
 

2643
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,670
you're like oh my God I thought I knew
that but I don't and so it can be

2644

00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,670
it like obvious things just disappear
from mind and it's cool like it it shows

2732
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:01,680
from mind and it's cool like it it shows
 

2733
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,430
from mind and it's cool like it it shows
actually the power of the Mind in a

2734
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:03,440
actually the power of the Mind in a
 

2735
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,670
actually the power of the Mind in a
positive sense to erase memories you

2736
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:05,680
positive sense to erase memories you
 

2737
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,990
positive sense to erase memories you
want erased maybe um but I don't know I

2738
00:54:08,990 --> 00:54:09,000
want erased maybe um but I don't know I
 

2739
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,190
want erased maybe um but I don't know I
don't know if there's a good explanation

2740
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:10,200
don't know if there's a good explanation
 

2741
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,789

that I found is is that some people
really just revolutionize a field by cre

2746
00:54:19,309 --> 00:54:19,319
really just revolutionize a field by cre
 

2747
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,430
really just revolutionize a field by cre
by creating a problem that didn't exist

2748
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:21,440
by creating a problem that didn't exist
 

2749
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,990
by creating a problem that didn't exist
before it's kind of like why I love

00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:23,000
before it's kind of like why I love
 

2751

science is like I I engineering is like
 

2753
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,829

solving other people problems and
 

2755
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,870
solving other people problems and
science is about creating problems I'm

science is about creating problems I'm
 

2757
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,470
science is about creating problems I'm
just much more like I want to break

2758
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:31,480
just much more like I want to break
 

2759
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,270
just much more like I want to break
things and you know create problems uh

2760
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:34,280
things and you know create problems uh
 

2761
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,470
things and you know create problems uh
not necessarily move fast though but but

00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:37,480
not necessarily move fast though but but

memory researchers of all time she comes
 

2769
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,510
memory researchers of all time she comes
up young woman in the field and this

2770
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:45,520
up young woman in the field and this
 

2771
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:49,549
up young woman in the field and this
mostly guy field and she gets into this

2772
00:54:49,549 --> 00:54:49,559
mostly guy field and she gets into this
 

2773
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,430
mostly guy field and she gets into this
idea of how do we tell the difference

2774
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,440
idea of how do we tell the difference
 

2775
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,309
idea of how do we tell the difference
between things that we've imagined and

2776
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:53,319
between things that we've imagined and
 

2777
00:54:53,319 --> 00:54:55,390
between things that we've imagined and
things that we actually remember how do

2778
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:55,400
things that we actually remember how do
 

2779
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,349
things that we actually remember how do
we tell I get some mental experience

2780
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:57,359
we tell I get some mental experience
 

2781
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,950
we tell I get some mental experience
where did that mental experience come

2782
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:58,960
where did that mental experience come
 

2783
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,430
where did that mental experience come
from right and it turns out this is a

2784
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:01,440
from right and it turns out this is a
 

2785
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,150
from right and it turns out this is a
huge problem because essentially our

2786
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
huge problem because essentially our
 

2787
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,430
huge problem because essentially our
mental experience of remembering

2788
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:05,440
mental experience of remembering
 

2789
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,470
mental experience of remembering
something that happened our mental

2790
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:07,480
something that happened our mental
 

2791
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,150
something that happened our mental
experience of thinking about something

2792
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:10,160
experience of thinking about something
 

2793
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:11,589
experience of thinking about something
how do you tell the difference they're

2794
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:11,599
how do you tell the difference they're
 

2795
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,470
how do you tell the difference they're
both largely constructions in our head

2796
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:15,480
both largely constructions in our head
 

2797
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,950
both largely constructions in our head
and so it is very important and the way

2798
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
and so it is very important and the way
 

2799
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,190
and so it is very important and the way
that you do it is I mean it's not

2800
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:22,200
that you do it is I mean it's not
 

2801
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,069
that you do it is I mean it's not
perfect but the way that we often do it

2802
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
perfect but the way that we often do it
 

2803
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,630
perfect but the way that we often do it
and succeed is by again using using our

2804
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
and succeed is by again using using our
 

2805
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,870
and succeed is by again using using our
prefrontal cortex and really focusing on

2806
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:29,880
prefrontal cortex and really focusing on
 

2807
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,950
prefrontal cortex and really focusing on
the sensory information or the place and

2808
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:32,960
the sensory information or the place and
 

2809
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,589
the sensory information or the place and
time and the things that put us back

2810
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:34,599
time and the things that put us back
 

2811
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:37,630
time and the things that put us back
into when this information happened and

2812
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:37,640
into when this information happened and
 

2813
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,069
into when this information happened and
if it's something you thought about

2814
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:39,079
if it's something you thought about
 

2815
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:40,670
if it's something you thought about
you're not going to have all of that

2816
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:40,680
you're not going to have all of that
 

2817
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,710
you're not going to have all of that
Vivid detail as you do for something

Vivid detail as you do for something
 

2819
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,789
Vivid detail as you do for something
that actually happened but it doesn't

2820
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:44,799
that actually happened but it doesn't
 

2821
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,630
that actually happened but it doesn't
work all the time but that that's a big

2822
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:46,640
work all the time but that that's a big
 

2823
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:47,950
work all the time but that that's a big
thing that you have to do but it takes

2824
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:47,960
thing that you have to do but it takes
 

2825
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,190
thing that you have to do but it takes
time it's slow and it's again effortful

2826
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:51,200
time it's slow and it's again effortful
 

2827
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,630
time it's slow and it's again effortful
but that's what you need to remember

2828
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:52,640
but that's what you need to remember
 

2829
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,630
but that's what you need to remember
accurately but what's cool and I think

2830
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
accurately but what's cool and I think
 

2831
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,349
accurately but what's cool and I think
this is what you alluded to about how

2832
00:55:56,349 --> 00:55:56,359
this is what you alluded to about how
 

2833
00:55:56,359 --> 00:55:58,270
this is what you alluded to about how
that was an interesting experience is

instead of trying to focus it on being

instead of trying to focus it on being
 

2911
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,589
instead of trying to focus it on being

you're just ruthlessly recombining

you're just ruthlessly recombining
 

2915
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,150
you're just ruthlessly recombining

necessary kind of goal in mind um I mean

2918
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
necessary kind of goal in mind um I mean
 

2919
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,270
necessary kind of goal in mind um I mean
or at least that's one kind of creation

2920
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:39,280
or at least that's one kind of creation

so imagination is

2922
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:41,160
so imagination is
 

2923
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,510
so imagination is
um

2924
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,520
um
 

2925
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,829

fundamentally coupled with memory in in

2926
00:57:46,829 --> 00:57:46,839
fundamentally coupled with memory in in
 

2927
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:49,670
fundamentally coupled with memory in in
both directions I think so I mean it's

2928
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,680
both directions I think so I mean it's
 

2929
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,109
both directions I think so I mean it's
not clear that it is in everyone but one

00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
not clear that it is in everyone but one

of the things that's been studied is
 

2933
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,349
of the things that's been studied is
some patients who have amnesia for

00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:01,960
to the hippocampus and if you ask them
 

2939
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,349
to the hippocampus and if you ask them
to imagine things that are not in front

2940
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:04,359
to imagine things that are not in front
 

2941
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:06,230
to imagine things that are not in front
of them like imagine what could happen

2942
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,240
of them like imagine what could happen
 

2943
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,190

find it very difficult to give you a

2946
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:11,119
find it very difficult to give you a
 

2947
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,510
find it very difficult to give you a
scenario what could happen or if they do

scenario what could happen or if they do
 

2949
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,430
scenario what could happen or if they do
it' be more stereotype like yes this

2950
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:15,440
it' be more stereotype like yes this
 

2951
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:16,870
it' be more stereotype like yes this
would happen this would but it's not

00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:16,880
would happen this would but it's not
 

2953
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,150
would happen this would but it's not
like they can come up with anything

2954
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,160
like they can come up with anything
 

2955
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,430
like they can come up with anything
that's very Vivid and creative in that

2956
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:20,440
that's very Vivid and creative in that
 

2957
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,589
that's very Vivid and creative in that
sense as partly because when you have

2958
00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:22,599
sense as partly because when you have
 

2959
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,270
sense as partly because when you have
amnesia you're stuck in the present

2960
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:25,280
amnesia you're stuck in the present
 

2961
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,950
amnesia you're stuck in the present
because the get a very good model of the

2962
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:27,960
because the get a very good model of the
 

2963
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,910
because the get a very good model of the
future it really helps to have episodic

2964
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:29,920
future it really helps to have episodic
 

2965
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,190
future it really helps to have episodic
memories to draw upon right and so

2966
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:33,200
memories to draw upon right and so
 

2967
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,670
memories to draw upon right and so
that's that's the basic idea and in fact

2968
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:35,680
that's that's the basic idea and in fact
 

2969
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,150
that's that's the basic idea and in fact
one of the most impressive things when

2970
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
one of the most impressive things when
 

2971
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,710
one of the most impressive things when
people started to scan people's brains

2972
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:40,720
people started to scan people's brains
 

2973
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:43,990
people started to scan people's brains
and ask people to remember past events

2974
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:44,000
and ask people to remember past events
 

2975
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,270
and ask people to remember past events
what they found was there was this big

2976
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:45,280
what they found was there was this big
 

2977
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,950
what they found was there was this big
network of the brain called the default

2978
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:46,960
network of the brain called the default
 

2979
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,190
network of the brain called the default
mode Network it gets a lot of pressed

2980
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:49,200
mode Network it gets a lot of pressed
 

2981
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,270
mode Network it gets a lot of pressed
because it's like thought to be

2982
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:50,280
because it's like thought to be
 

2983
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,109
because it's like thought to be
important it's engaged during mind

2984
00:58:52,109 --> 00:58:52,119
important it's engaged during mind
 

2985
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:53,990
important it's engaged during mind
wandering and if I ask you to pay

2986
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:54,000
wandering and if I ask you to pay
 

2987
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,309
wandering and if I ask you to pay
attention to something it only comes on

2988
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:56,319
attention to something it only comes on
 

2989
00:58:56,319 --> 00:58:57,950
attention to something it only comes on
when you stop paying attention you know

2990
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:57,960
when you stop paying attention you know
 

2991
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,430
when you stop paying attention you know
so people oh it's just this kind of you

2992
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:00,440
so people oh it's just this kind of you
 

2993
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,910
so people oh it's just this kind of you
know daydreaming Network and I thought

2994
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:02,920
know daydreaming Network and I thought
 

2995
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,589
know daydreaming Network and I thought
this is just ridiculous research who

2996
00:59:04,589 --> 00:59:04,599
this is just ridiculous research who
 

2997
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:07,349
this is just ridiculous research who
cares you know um but then what people

2998
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:07,359
cares you know um but then what people
 

2999
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:09,510
cares you know um but then what people
found was when people recall episodic

3000
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:09,520
found was when people recall episodic
 

3001
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:13,230
found was when people recall episodic
memories this network gets active and uh

3002
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:13,240
memories this network gets active and uh
 

3003
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,910
memories this network gets active and uh
so we started to look into it and this

3004
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:15,920
so we started to look into it and this
 

3005
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,470
so we started to look into it and this
network of areas is really closely

3006
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
network of areas is really closely
 

3007
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,349
network of areas is really closely
functionally interacting with the

3008
00:59:20,349 --> 00:59:20,359
functionally interacting with the
 

3009
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:22,870
functionally interacting with the
hippocampus and so in fact some would

3010
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
hippocampus and so in fact some would
 

3011
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,710
hippocampus and so in fact some would
say the hippocampus is part of this

3012
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
say the hippocampus is part of this
 

3013
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,109
say the hippocampus is part of this
default Network and if you look at brain

3014
00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:28,119
default Network and if you look at brain
 

3015
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:30,510
default Network and if you look at brain
images of people or brain maps of

3016
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:30,520
images of people or brain maps of
 

3017
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,230
images of people or brain maps of
Activation so to speak of people

3018
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:32,240

00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:36,359
that could happen in the future even
 

3023
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,589
that could happen in the future even
things that couldn't really be very

plausible they look very similar I mean

3026
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:41,240
plausible they look very similar I mean
 

3027
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,910
plausible they look very similar I mean
you know to the naked eye they look

3028
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:42,920
you know to the naked eye they look
 

3029
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,789
you know to the naked eye they look
almost the same as maps of brain

3039
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:55,390

is that basically it's kind of taking
 

3041

see it all as one yeah there was
 

3135
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,510
see it all as one yeah there was
actually this famous ponist he's kind of

3136
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:49,520
actually this famous ponist he's kind of
 

3137
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,029
actually this famous ponist he's kind of
like back then the equivalent of a

3138
01:01:51,029 --> 01:01:51,039
like back then the equivalent of a
 

3139
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:52,430
like back then the equivalent of a
memory athlete except he would go to

3140
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:52,440
memory athlete except he would go to
 

3141
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,470
memory athlete except he would go to
shows and do this uh um those described

3142
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:55,480
shows and do this uh um those described
 

3143
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,309
shows and do this uh um those described
by the this uh really famous neuros

3144
01:01:57,309 --> 01:01:57,319
by the this uh really famous neuros
 

3145
01:01:57,319 --> 01:02:00,390
by the this uh really famous neuros
psychologist from Russia named uh Lura

3146
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:00,400
psychologist from Russia named uh Lura
 

3147
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,750
psychologist from Russia named uh Lura
and so this guy was named Solomon shevi

3148
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:03,760
and so this guy was named Solomon shevi
 

3149
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,470
and so this guy was named Solomon shevi
and he had this condition called

3150
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:05,480
and he had this condition called
 

3151
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,069
and he had this condition called
synesthesia that basically created these

3152
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:08,079
synesthesia that basically created these
 

3153
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,190
synesthesia that basically created these
weird associations between different

3154
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:10,200
weird associations between different
 

3155
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,950
weird associations between different
senses that normally wouldn't go

3156
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:11,960
senses that normally wouldn't go
 

3157
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,910
senses that normally wouldn't go
together so that gave him this

3158
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:14,920
together so that gave him this
 

3159
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,910
together so that gave him this
incredibly vivid

3160
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:16,920
incredibly vivid
 

3161
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,190
incredibly vivid
imagination that he would use to

3162
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,200
imagination that he would use to
 

3163
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,710
imagination that he would use to
basically imagine all sorts of things

3164
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:22,720
basically imagine all sorts of things
 

3165
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,269
basically imagine all sorts of things
that he would need to memorize and he

3166
01:02:24,269 --> 01:02:24,279
that he would need to memorize and he
 

3167
01:02:24,279 --> 01:02:26,549
that he would need to memorize and he
would just imagine like just create

3168
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559
would just imagine like just create
 

3169
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,950
would just imagine like just create
these incredibly detailed things in his

3170
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:28,960
these incredibly detailed things in his
 

3171
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,670
these incredibly detailed things in his
head that allowed him to memorize all

3172
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:30,680
head that allowed him to memorize all
 

3173
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,710
head that allowed him to memorize all
sorts of stuff but it also really

3174
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:33,720
sorts of stuff but it also really
 

3175
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,510
sorts of stuff but it also really
haunted him by some reports that

3176
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:35,520
haunted him by some reports that
 

3177
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,349
haunted him by some reports that
basically it was like he was at some

3178
01:02:38,349 --> 01:02:38,359
basically it was like he was at some
 

3179
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:39,870
basically it was like he was at some
point you know and again who knows the

3180
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:39,880
point you know and again who knows the
 

3181
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,190
point you know and again who knows the
drinking was part of this but at some

3182
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:42,200
drinking was part of this but at some
 

3183
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,950
drinking was part of this but at some
point had trouble differentiating his

3184
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:43,960
point had trouble differentiating his
 

3185
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,670
point had trouble differentiating his
imagination from reality right and this

3186
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:46,680
imagination from reality right and this
 

3187
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,910
imagination from reality right and this
is this is interesting because it's like

3188
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:48,920
is this is interesting because it's like
 

3189
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:51,870
is this is interesting because it's like
I mean that's what psychosis is in some

3190
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:51,880
I mean that's what psychosis is in some
 

3191
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:55,390
I mean that's what psychosis is in some
ways is you you know first of all you're

3192
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:55,400
ways is you you know first of all you're
 

3193
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,309
ways is you you know first of all you're
just learning connections from

3194
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:57,319
just learning connections from
 

3195
01:02:57,319 --> 01:02:58,990
just learning connections from
prediction errors that you probably

3196
01:02:58,990 --> 01:02:59,000
prediction errors that you probably
 

3197
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,510
prediction errors that you probably
shouldn't learn and the other part of it

3198
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,520
shouldn't learn and the other part of it
 

3199
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,349
shouldn't learn and the other part of it
is is that your internal signals are

3200
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:04,359
is is that your internal signals are
 

3201
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:06,910
is is that your internal signals are
being confused with actual things in the

3202
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:06,920
being confused with actual things in the
 

3203
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,390
being confused with actual things in the
outside world right well that's why a

3204
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:09,400
outside world right well that's why a
 

3205
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,109
outside world right well that's why a
lot of this stuff is both feature and

3206
01:03:11,109 --> 01:03:11,119
lot of this stuff is both feature and
 

3207
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:13,269
lot of this stuff is both feature and
bug it's a double-edged sword yeah I

3208
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:13,279
bug it's a double-edged sword yeah I
 

3209
01:03:13,279 --> 01:03:14,470
bug it's a double-edged sword yeah I
mean it might be why there's such an

3210
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:14,480
mean it might be why there's such an
 

3211
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,430
mean it might be why there's such an
interesting relationship between genius

3212
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:16,440
interesting relationship between genius
 

3213
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,069
interesting relationship between genius
and

3214
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:18,079
and
 

3215
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,029
and
psychosis yeah maybe they're just uh two

3216
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
psychosis yeah maybe they're just uh two
 

3217
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,190
psychosis yeah maybe they're just uh two
sides of the same

3218
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:23,200
sides of the same
 

3219
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,829
sides of the same
coin humans are fascinating aren't they

3220
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:25,839
coin humans are fascinating aren't they
 

3221
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:28,710
coin humans are fascinating aren't they
I think so sometimes scary but mostly

3222
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:28,720
I think so sometimes scary but mostly
 

3223
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,549
I think so sometimes scary but mostly
fascinating can we just talk about

3224
01:03:31,549 --> 01:03:31,559
fascinating can we just talk about
 

3225
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,349
fascinating can we just talk about
memory sport a little longer there's

3226
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:33,359
memory sport a little longer there's
 

3227

01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:21,760
chemo brain where people become like
 

3269
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,549
chemo brain where people become like
they just lose a lot of their

3270
01:04:23,549 --> 01:04:23,559
they just lose a lot of their
 

3271
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:26,670
they just lose a lot of their
sharpness um and so he wanted to fight

3272
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:26,680
sharpness um and so he wanted to fight
 

3273
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,789
sharpness um and so he wanted to fight
that by learning these memory skills so

3274
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:28,799
that by learning these memory skills so
 

3275
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,109
that by learning these memory skills so
he bought a book and this is the story

3276
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:31,119
he bought a book and this is the story
 

3277
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,670
he bought a book and this is the story
you hear in a lot of memory athletes is

3278
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:32,680
you hear in a lot of memory athletes is
 

3279
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,549
you hear in a lot of memory athletes is
they buy a book by other memory athletes

3280
01:04:35,549 --> 01:04:35,559
they buy a book by other memory athletes
 

3281
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:38,510
they buy a book by other memory athletes
or other memory experts so to speak and

3282
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:38,520
or other memory experts so to speak and
 

3283
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,190
or other memory experts so to speak and
they just learn those skills and

3284
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:40,200
they just learn those skills and
 

3285
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,190
they just learn those skills and
practice them over and over again they

3286
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:42,200
practice them over and over again they
 

3287
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,150
practice them over and over again they
start by winning bets and so forth and

3288
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:44,160
start by winning bets and so forth and
 

3289
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,230
start by winning bets and so forth and
then they go into these competitions and

3290
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:46,240
then they go into these competitions and
 

3291
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,990
then they go into these competitions and
the competitions are typically things

3292
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
the competitions are typically things
 

3293
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,710
the competitions are typically things
like memorizing long strings of numbers

3294
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:50,720
like memorizing long strings of numbers
 

3295
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,349
like memorizing long strings of numbers
or memorizing you know orders of cards

3296
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:53,359
or memorizing you know orders of cards
 

3297
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,710
or memorizing you know orders of cards
and so forth so there tend to be pretty

3298
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:55,720
and so forth so there tend to be pretty
 

3299
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,710
and so forth so there tend to be pretty
arbitrary things not like things that

3300
01:04:57,710 --> 01:04:57,720
arbitrary things not like things that
 

3301
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,990
arbitrary things not like things that
would be able you'd be able to bring a

3302
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
would be able you'd be able to bring a
 

3303
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,069
would be able you'd be able to bring a
lot of prior knowledge but they build

3304
01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:03,079
lot of prior knowledge but they build
 

3305
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:04,990
lot of prior knowledge but they build
the skills that you need to memorize

3306
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:05,000
the skills that you need to memorize
 

3307
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,109
the skills that you need to memorize
arbitrary things yeah it's fascinating

3308
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:07,119
arbitrary things yeah it's fascinating
 

3309
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,710
arbitrary things yeah it's fascinating
I've uh gotten a chance to work with

3310
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:08,720
I've uh gotten a chance to work with
 

3311
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,990
I've uh gotten a chance to work with
something called uh endb tasks so

3312
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:11,000
something called uh endb tasks so
 

3313
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,910
something called uh endb tasks so
there's all these kinds of tasks memory

3314
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:12,920
there's all these kinds of tasks memory
 

3315
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,470
there's all these kinds of tasks memory
recall tasks that are used to kind of

3316
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:15,480
recall tasks that are used to kind of
 

3317
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,990
recall tasks that are used to kind of
load up the quote unquote working memory

3318
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
load up the quote unquote working memory
 

3319
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,549
load up the quote unquote working memory
yeah yeah and to

3320
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:19,559
yeah yeah and to
 

3321
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:22,069
yeah yeah and to
see the psychologist used it to test all

3322
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:22,079
see the psychologist used it to test all
 

3323
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:23,470
see the psychologist used it to test all
kinds of stuff like to see how well

3324
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:23,480
kinds of stuff like to see how well
 

3325
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,349
kinds of stuff like to see how well
you're good at multitasking use it in

3326
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:26,359
you're good at multitasking use it in
 

3327
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:28,470
you're good at multitasking use it in
particular for the task of driving like

3328
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:28,480
particular for the task of driving like
 

3329
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,150
particular for the task of driving like
if it if we fill up your brain

3330
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:31,160
if it if we fill up your brain
 

3331
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,510
if it if we fill up your brain
with intensive working memory tasks how

3332
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
with intensive working memory tasks how
 

3333
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:39,150
with intensive working memory tasks how
good are you at also not crashing that

3334
01:05:39,150 --> 01:05:39,160
good are you at also not crashing that
 

3335
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:42,430
good are you at also not crashing that
kind of stuff so it's fascinating but

3336
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:42,440
kind of stuff so it's fascinating but
 

3337
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,510
kind of stuff so it's fascinating but
again those tasks are arbitrary and

3338
01:05:44,510 --> 01:05:44,520
again those tasks are arbitrary and
 

3339
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,430
again those tasks are arbitrary and
they're usually about recalling a

3340
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:46,440
they're usually about recalling a
 

3341
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,190
they're usually about recalling a
sequence of numbers in some kind of semi

3342
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
sequence of numbers in some kind of semi
 

3343
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,750
sequence of numbers in some kind of semi
complex way are you uh do you have any

3344
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:51,760
complex way are you uh do you have any
 

3345
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,349
complex way are you uh do you have any
favorite tasks of this nature in your

3346
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:53,359
favorite tasks of this nature in your
 

3347
01:05:53,359 --> 01:05:58,069
favorite tasks of this nature in your
own uh studies I've really been most

3348
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
own uh studies I've really been most
 

3349
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,990
own uh studies I've really been most
excited about going in the opposite

3350
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
excited about going in the opposite
 

3351
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,990
excited about going in the opposite
direction and using things that are more

3352
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
direction and using things that are more
 

3353
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,109
direction and using things that are more
and more

3354
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:03,119
and more
 

3355
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,750
and more
naturalistic and the reason is is that

3356
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:05,760
naturalistic and the reason is is that
 

3357
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,470
naturalistic and the reason is is that
we've really move we've moved in that

3358
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:07,480
we've really move we've moved in that
 

3359
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,109
we've really move we've moved in that
direction because what we found is that

3360
01:06:10,109 --> 01:06:10,119
direction because what we found is that
 

3361
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:13,230
direction because what we found is that
memory works very very differently when

3362
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:13,240
memory works very very differently when
 

3363
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,910
memory works very very differently when
you study it when you study memory in

3364
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:15,920
you study it when you study memory in
 

3365
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,910
you study it when you study memory in
the way that people typically

3366
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:17,920
the way that people typically
 

3367
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,390
the way that people typically
remember and so it goes into a much more

3368
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:21,400
remember and so it goes into a much more
 

3369
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,750
remember and so it goes into a much more
predictive mode and you have these um

3370
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:23,760
predictive mode and you have these um
 

3371
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,390
predictive mode and you have these um
event boundaries for instance and you

3372
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:25,400
event boundaries for instance and you
 

3373
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,549
event boundaries for instance and you
have

3374
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
have
 

3375
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:29,789
have
uh but a lot of what happens is this

3376
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:29,799
uh but a lot of what happens is this
 

3377
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:31,829
uh but a lot of what happens is this
kind of fascinating mix that we've been

3378
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:31,839
kind of fascinating mix that we've been
 

3379
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:34,630
kind of fascinating mix that we've been
talking about a mix of interpretations

3380
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:34,640
talking about a mix of interpretations
 

3381
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,670
talking about a mix of interpretations
and Imagination with perception and so

3382
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:38,680
and Imagination with perception and so
 

3383
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:41,029
and Imagination with perception and so
um and the new direction we're going in

3384
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
um and the new direction we're going in
 

3385
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,470
um and the new direction we're going in
is understanding uh navigation in our

3386
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:43,480
is understanding uh navigation in our
 

3387
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,109
is understanding uh navigation in our
memory for places and the reason is is

3388
01:06:46,109 --> 01:06:46,119
memory for places and the reason is is
 

3389
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:48,190
memory for places and the reason is is
that there's a lot of work that's done

3390
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:48,200
that there's a lot of work that's done
 

3391
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,829
that there's a lot of work that's done
in rats which is very good work they

3392
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:50,839
in rats which is very good work they
 

3393
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,990
in rats which is very good work they
have a rat and they put it in a box and

3394
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:53,000
have a rat and they put it in a box and
 

3395
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,069
have a rat and they put it in a box and
the rat goes chases cheese in a box and

3396
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:55,079
the rat goes chases cheese in a box and
 

3397
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,309
the rat goes chases cheese in a box and
you'll find cells in the hippocampus

3398
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:57,319
you'll find cells in the hippocampus
 

3399
01:06:57,319 --> 01:06:59,269
you'll find cells in the hippocampus
that fire when a rat is in different

3400
01:06:59,269 --> 01:06:59,279
that fire when a rat is in different
 

3401
01:06:59,279 --> 01:07:02,549
that fire when a rat is in different
places in the box and so the

3402
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:02,559
places in the box and so the
 

3403
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,190
places in the box and so the
conventional wisdom is that the

3404
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:04,200
conventional wisdom is that the
 

3405
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:07,549
conventional wisdom is that the
hippocampus forms this map of the box

3406
01:07:07,549 --> 01:07:07,559
hippocampus forms this map of the box
 

3407
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:11,670
hippocampus forms this map of the box
and I think that probably may happen

3408
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:11,680
and I think that probably may happen
 

3409
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:14,190
and I think that probably may happen
when you have like absolutely no

3410
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:14,200
when you have like absolutely no
 

3411
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,470
when you have like absolutely no
knowledge of the world right but I think

3412
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:17,480
knowledge of the world right but I think
 

3413
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:18,990
knowledge of the world right but I think
one of the cool things about human

3414
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:19,000
one of the cool things about human
 

3415
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,309
one of the cool things about human
memory is we can bring to bear our past

3416
01:07:21,309 --> 01:07:21,319
memory is we can bring to bear our past
 

3417
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:24,390
memory is we can bring to bear our past
experiences to e economically learn new

3418
01:07:24,390 --> 01:07:24,400
experiences to e economically learn new
 

3419
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:28,150
experiences to e economically learn new
ones and so for instance if you learn a

3420
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:28,160
ones and so for instance if you learn a
 

3421
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,150
ones and so for instance if you learn a
map of an Ikea let's say if I go to the

3422
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:30,160
map of an Ikea let's say if I go to the
 

3423
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,990
map of an Ikea let's say if I go to the
IKEA in Austin I'm sure there's one here

3424
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:33,000
IKEA in Austin I'm sure there's one here
 

3425
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,390
IKEA in Austin I'm sure there's one here
I probably could go to this Ikea and

3426
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:35,400
I probably could go to this Ikea and
 

3427
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,230
I probably could go to this Ikea and
find my way to the you know where the

3428
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,240
find my way to the you know where the
 

3429
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,029
find my way to the you know where the
wine glasses are without having to even

3430
01:07:41,029 --> 01:07:41,039
wine glasses are without having to even
 

3431
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,750
wine glasses are without having to even
think about it because it's got a very

3432
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:42,760
think about it because it's got a very
 

3433
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,309
think about it because it's got a very
similar layout even though Ikea is a

3434
01:07:44,309 --> 01:07:44,319
similar layout even though Ikea is a
 

3435
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,589
similar layout even though Ikea is a
nightmare to get around once I learned

3436
01:07:46,589 --> 01:07:46,599
nightmare to get around once I learned
 

3437
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:48,990
nightmare to get around once I learned
my local Ikea I can use that map

3438
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:49,000
my local Ikea I can use that map
 

3439
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,269
my local Ikea I can use that map
everywhere white form a brand new one

3440
01:07:51,269 --> 01:07:51,279
everywhere white form a brand new one
 

3441
01:07:51,279 --> 01:07:55,029
everywhere white form a brand new one
for a new place and so that kind of

3442
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:55,039
for a new place and so that kind of
 

3443
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,589
for a new place and so that kind of
ability to reuse information really

3444
01:07:57,589 --> 01:07:57,599
ability to reuse information really
 

3445
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,430
ability to reuse information really
comes into play when we look at things

3446
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:00,440
comes into play when we look at things
 

3447
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,910
comes into play when we look at things
that are you know more naturalistic

3448
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:02,920
that are you know more naturalistic
 

3449
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,269
that are you know more naturalistic
tasks um and uh another thing that we're

3450
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:06,279
tasks um and uh another thing that we're
 

3451
01:08:06,279 --> 01:08:07,870
tasks um and uh another thing that we're
really interested in is this idea of

3452
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:07,880
really interested in is this idea of
 

3453
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,069
really interested in is this idea of
like what if instead of basically

3454
01:08:11,069 --> 01:08:11,079
like what if instead of basically
 

3455
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:13,750
like what if instead of basically
mapping out every coordinate in a space

3456
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:13,760
mapping out every coordinate in a space
 

3457
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,229
mapping out every coordinate in a space
you form a pretty economical graph that

3458
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:17,239
you form a pretty economical graph that
 

3459
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:19,829
you form a pretty economical graph that
connects basically the major landmarks

3460
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:19,839
connects basically the major landmarks
 

3461
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,470
connects basically the major landmarks
together and being able to use that as

3462
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:22,480
together and being able to use that as
 

3463
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,229
together and being able to use that as
you know emphasizing the things that are

3464
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:24,239
you know emphasizing the things that are
 

3465
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:26,189
you know emphasizing the things that are
most important the places that you go

3466
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:26,199
most important the places that you go
 

3467
01:08:26,199 --> 01:08:28,349
most important the places that you go
for food and the places that are

3468
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:28,359
for food and the places that are
 

3469
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:30,990
for food and the places that are
landmarks that help you get around and

3470
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:31,000
landmarks that help you get around and
 

3471
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,990
landmarks that help you get around and
then filling in the blanks for the rest

01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:33,000
then filling in the blanks for the rest
 

3473
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,990
then filling in the blanks for the rest
because I really believe that cognitive

01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,110

combination of actual verifiable details
 

3483
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:48,950
combination of actual verifiable details
and then a lot of inference that you

3484
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:48,960
and then a lot of inference that you
 

3485
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,189
and then a lot of inference that you
make so what have you learned about this

3486
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:51,199
make so what have you learned about this
 

3487
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:55,149
make so what have you learned about this
kind of spatial mapping of places how do

3488
01:08:55,149 --> 01:08:55,159
kind of spatial mapping of places how do
 

3489
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:57,990
kind of spatial mapping of places how do
people represent locations uh there's a

3490
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
people represent locations uh there's a
 

3491
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,349
people represent locations uh there's a
lot of variability I think that and

3492
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:00,359
lot of variability I think that and
 

3493
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:02,510
lot of variability I think that and
there's a lot of disagreement about how

3494
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:02,520
there's a lot of disagreement about how
 

3495
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,590
there's a lot of disagreement about how
people represent locations in a world of

3496
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:05,600
people represent locations in a world of
 

3497
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,269
people represent locations in a world of
GPS and physical maps people can learn

3498
01:09:09,269 --> 01:09:09,279
GPS and physical maps people can learn
 

3499
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:10,789
GPS and physical maps people can learn
it from like basically what they call

3500
01:09:10,789 --> 01:09:10,799
it from like basically what they call
 

3501
01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:12,590
it from like basically what they call
like survey perspective of being able to

3502
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:12,600
like survey perspective of being able to
 

3503
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,789
like survey perspective of being able to
see everything and so that's one way in

3504
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:15,799
see everything and so that's one way in
 

3505
01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:17,189
see everything and so that's one way in
which humans can do it that's a little

3506
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:17,199
which humans can do it that's a little
 

3507
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,789
which humans can do it that's a little
bit different um there's one way which

3508
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:19,799
bit different um there's one way which
 

3509
01:09:19,799 --> 01:09:22,470
bit different um there's one way which
we can memorize Roots like I know how to

3510
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:22,480
we can memorize Roots like I know how to
 

3511
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:24,950
we can memorize Roots like I know how to
get from here to let's say if I knew

3512
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:24,960
get from here to let's say if I knew
 

3513
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,789
get from here to let's say if I knew
walk here from my hotel I could just

3514
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:26,799
walk here from my hotel I could just
 

3515
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:29,510
walk here from my hotel I could just
rigidly follow that route back right and

3516
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:29,520
rigidly follow that route back right and
 

3517
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:31,789
rigidly follow that route back right and
there's another more integrative way

3518
01:09:31,789 --> 01:09:31,799
there's another more integrative way
 

3519
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:34,110
there's another more integrative way
which would be what's called a cognitive

3520
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:34,120
which would be what's called a cognitive
 

3521
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,789
which would be what's called a cognitive
map which would be kind of a a sense of

3522
01:09:36,789 --> 01:09:36,799
map which would be kind of a a sense of
 

3523
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,829
map which would be kind of a a sense of
how everything relates to each

3524
01:09:38,829 --> 01:09:38,839
how everything relates to each
 

3525
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:41,950
how everything relates to each
other and so there's lots of people who

3526
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:41,960
other and so there's lots of people who
 

3527
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,910
other and so there's lots of people who
believe that these maps that we have in

3528
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:44,920
believe that these maps that we have in
 

3529
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,030
believe that these maps that we have in
our head are isomorphic with the world

3530
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
our head are isomorphic with the world
 

3531
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:49,630
our head are isomorphic with the world
they're like these literal coordinates

3532
01:09:49,630 --> 01:09:49,640
they're like these literal coordinates
 

3533
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,430
they're like these literal coordinates
um that follow ukian space and as you

3534
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:52,440
um that follow ukian space and as you
 

3535
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,470
um that follow ukian space and as you
know ukian mathematics is very

3536
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:54,480
know ukian mathematics is very
 

3537
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,910
know ukian mathematics is very
constrained right

3538
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:55,920
constrained right
 

3539
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,910
constrained right
and I think that we are actually much

3540
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:57,920
and I think that we are actually much
 

3541
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,189
and I think that we are actually much
more generative in our maps of space so

3542
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
more generative in our maps of space so
 

3543
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,189
more generative in our maps of space so
that we do have these bits and pieces

3544
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
that we do have these bits and pieces
 

3545
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,870
that we do have these bits and pieces
and and we we've got a small task it's

3546
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:05,880
and and we we've got a small task it's
 

3547
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:08,910
and and we we've got a small task it's
right now not yet like uh we need to do

3548
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:08,920
right now not yet like uh we need to do
 

3549
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,510
right now not yet like uh we need to do
some work on it for further analyses but

3550
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:11,520
some work on it for further analyses but
 

3551
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,470
some work on it for further analyses but
one of the things we're looking at is uh

3552
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:14,480
one of the things we're looking at is uh
 

3553
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,550
one of the things we're looking at is uh
these signals called ripples in the

3554
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:16,560
these signals called ripples in the
 

3555
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,830
these signals called ripples in the
hippocampus which are these bursts of

3556
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:18,840
hippocampus which are these bursts of
 

3557
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,790
hippocampus which are these bursts of
activity that you see that are

3558
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800
activity that you see that are
 

3559
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,630
activity that you see that are
synchronized with areas in in the

3560
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:22,640
synchronized with areas in in the
 

3561
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,590
synchronized with areas in in the
neocortex in the default Network

3562
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:24,600
neocortex in the default Network
 

3563
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:27,669
neocortex in the default Network
actually and so what we find is is that

3564
01:10:27,669 --> 01:10:27,679
actually and so what we find is is that
 

3565
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,470
actually and so what we find is is that
those ripples seem to increase at

3566
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:29,480
those ripples seem to increase at
 

3567
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,390
those ripples seem to increase at
navigationally important points when

3568
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:31,400
navigationally important points when
 

3569
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,270
navigationally important points when
you're making a decision or when you

3570
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,280
you're making a decision or when you
 

3571
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,870
you're making a decision or when you
reach a goal it speaks to the emotion

3572
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:35,880
reach a goal it speaks to the emotion
 

3573
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:38,510
reach a goal it speaks to the emotion
thing right because if you have limited

01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:38,520
thing right because if you have limited

choices if I'm walking down a street I

3576
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:41,920
choices if I'm walking down a street I
 

3577
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,430
choices if I'm walking down a street I
could really just get a mental map of

3578
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:44,440
could really just get a mental map of
 

3579
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,229
could really just get a mental map of
the neighborhood with a more minimal

3580
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:46,239
the neighborhood with a more minimal
 

3581
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:48,030
the neighborhood with a more minimal
kind of thing by just saying here's the

3582
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:48,040
kind of thing by just saying here's the
 

3583
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,229
kind of thing by just saying here's the
intersections and here's the directions

3584
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:50,239
intersections and here's the directions
 

3585
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:51,950
intersections and here's the directions
I take to get in between them and what

3586
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:51,960
I take to get in between them and what
 

3587
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,070
I take to get in between them and what
we found in general in our MRI studies

3588
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:54,080
we found in general in our MRI studies
 

3589
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:58,510
we found in general in our MRI studies
is basic Ally the more people can reduce

3590
01:10:58,510 --> 01:10:58,520
is basic Ally the more people can reduce
 

3591
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,270
is basic Ally the more people can reduce
the problem whether it's space or any

3592
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:01,280
the problem whether it's space or any
 

3593
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:04,550
the problem whether it's space or any
kind of decision-making problem the less

3594
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:04,560
kind of decision-making problem the less
 

3595
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,070
kind of decision-making problem the less
the hippocampus encodes it really is

3596
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:07,080
the hippocampus encodes it really is
 

3597
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,870
the hippocampus encodes it really is
very economical towards the points of

3598
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:09,880
very economical towards the points of
 

3599
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,790
very economical towards the points of
most highest information content and

3600
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:12,800
most highest information content and
 

3601
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,030
most highest information content and
value so can you describe the encoding

3602
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:16,040
value so can you describe the encoding
 

3603
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,669
value so can you describe the encoding
in the hippocampus and the ripples you

3604
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:17,679
in the hippocampus and the ripples you
 

3605
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,350
in the hippocampus and the ripples you
were talking about with the what's the

3606
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360
were talking about with the what's the
 

3607
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,030
were talking about with the what's the
signal in which we see the ripples yeah

3608
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:24,040
signal in which we see the ripples yeah
 

3609
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,550
signal in which we see the ripples yeah
so this is really interesting there are

3610
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:25,560
so this is really interesting there are
 

3611
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,830
so this is really interesting there are
these oscillations right so there's

3612
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
these oscillations right so there's
 

3613
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,910
these oscillations right so there's
these waves that you basically see and

3614
01:11:30,910 --> 01:11:30,920
these waves that you basically see and
 

3615
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,870
these waves that you basically see and
um these waves are points of very high

3616
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:32,880
um these waves are points of very high
 

3617
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,950
um these waves are points of very high
excitability and low

3618
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:34,960
excitability and low
 

3619
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,830
excitability and low
excitability and uh at least during they

3620
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:37,840
excitability and uh at least during they
 

3621
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,590
excitability and uh at least during they
happen actually during slow wave sleep

3622
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:39,600
happen actually during slow wave sleep
 

3623
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,550
happen actually during slow wave sleep
too so the deepest stages of sleep and

3624
01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:41,560
too so the deepest stages of sleep and
 

3625
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,990
too so the deepest stages of sleep and
you're just zoned out right you see

3626
01:11:43,990 --> 01:11:44,000
you're just zoned out right you see
 

3627
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,189
you're just zoned out right you see
these very slow waves where it's like

3628
01:11:46,189 --> 01:11:46,199
these very slow waves where it's like
 

3629
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:48,070
these very slow waves where it's like
very excitable and then very unexcitable

3630
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:48,080
very excitable and then very unexcitable
 

3631
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,669
very excitable and then very unexcitable
it goes up and down and on top of them

3632
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:50,679
it goes up and down and on top of them
 

3633
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:52,270
it goes up and down and on top of them
you'll see these little sharp wve

3634
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:52,280
you'll see these little sharp wve
 

3635
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,870
you'll see these little sharp wve
Ripples and when there's a ripple in the

3636
01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:54,880
Ripples and when there's a ripple in the
 

3637
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,350
Ripples and when there's a ripple in the
hip campus you tend to see a sequence of

3638
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:58,360
hip campus you tend to see a sequence of
 

3639
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,790
hip campus you tend to see a sequence of
cells that resemble a sequence of cells

3640
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:01,800
cells that resemble a sequence of cells
 

3641
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,030
cells that resemble a sequence of cells
that fire when you know an animal is

3642
01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:04,040
that fire when you know an animal is
 

3643
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,709
that fire when you know an animal is
actually doing something in the world so

3644
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
actually doing something in the world so
 

3645
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,750
actually doing something in the world so
it almost is like a little people call

3646
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:08,760
it almost is like a little people call
 

3647
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,830
it almost is like a little people call
it replay I think it's a little bit I

3648
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:10,840
it replay I think it's a little bit I
 

3649
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,510
it replay I think it's a little bit I
don't like that term but it's basically

3650
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
don't like that term but it's basically
 

3651
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,830
don't like that term but it's basically
a little bit of a compressed play of the

3652
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:17,840
a little bit of a compressed play of the
 

3653
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,669
a little bit of a compressed play of the
sequence of activity in the brain that

3654
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
sequence of activity in the brain that
 

3655
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,550
sequence of activity in the brain that
was taking place earlier and during

3656
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:22,560
was taking place earlier and during
 

3657
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:24,390
was taking place earlier and during
those moments there's a little window of

3658
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:24,400
those moments there's a little window of
 

3659
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,550
those moments there's a little window of
communication between the hippocampus

3660
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
communication between the hippocampus
 

3661
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,310
communication between the hippocampus
and these areas in the Neo cortex and so

3662
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:29,320
and these areas in the Neo cortex and so
 

3663
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,229
and these areas in the Neo cortex and so
um that I think helps you form new

3664
01:12:32,229 --> 01:12:32,239
um that I think helps you form new
 

3665
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:34,870
um that I think helps you form new
memories but it also helps you I think

3666
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:34,880
memories but it also helps you I think
 

3667
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,270
memories but it also helps you I think
stabilize them but also really connect

3668
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
stabilize them but also really connect
 

3669
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,030
stabilize them but also really connect
different things together in memory and

3670
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:39,040
different things together in memory and
 

3671
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,430
different things together in memory and
allows you to build Bridges between

3672
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,440
allows you to build Bridges between
 

3673
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,430
allows you to build Bridges between
different events that you've had and so

3674
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
different events that you've had and so
 

3675
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,030
different events that you've had and so
this is one of at least our theories of

3676
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:46,040
this is one of at least our theories of
 

3677
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,510
this is one of at least our theories of
sleep and its real role in helping you

3678
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:48,520
sleep and its real role in helping you
 

3679
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,430
sleep and its real role in helping you
see the connections between different

3680
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:50,440
see the connections between different
 

3681
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,510
see the connections between different
events that you've experienced oh the so

3682
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:52,520
events that you've experienced oh the so
 

3683
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,229
events that you've experienced oh the so
during sleep is when the connections are

3684
01:12:54,229 --> 01:12:54,239
during sleep is when the connections are
 

3685
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:57,149
during sleep is when the connections are
formed the connections between different

3686
01:12:57,149 --> 01:12:57,159
formed the connections between different
 

3687
01:12:57,159 --> 01:12:59,790
formed the connections between different
events yeah right so it's like You See

3688
01:12:59,790 --> 01:12:59,800
events yeah right so it's like You See
 

3689
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,629
events yeah right so it's like You See
Me Now you see me next week you see me a

3690
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:02,639
Me Now you see me next week you see me a
 

3691
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:04,790
Me Now you see me next week you see me a
month later you start to build a little

3692
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:04,800
month later you start to build a little
 

3693
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,550
month later you start to build a little
internal model of how I behave and and

3694
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:07,560
internal model of how I behave and and
 

3695
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,310
internal model of how I behave and and
you know what to expect of me and we

3696
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:10,320
you know what to expect of me and we
 

3697
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,910
you know what to expect of me and we
think sleep one of the things that

3698
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:11,920
think sleep one of the things that
 

3699
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,030
think sleep one of the things that
allows you to do is figure out those

3700
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:14,040
allows you to do is figure out those
 

3701
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:16,390
allows you to do is figure out those
connections and connect the dots and

3702
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:16,400
connections and connect the dots and
 

3703
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,510
connections and connect the dots and
find the signal and the noise so you

3704
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:18,520
find the signal and the noise so you
 

3705
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,430
find the signal and the noise so you
mentioned uh

3706
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:20,440
mentioned uh
 

3707
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,229
mentioned uh
fmri what is it and how is it used in

3708
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:23,239
fmri what is it and how is it used in
 

3709
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:25,310
fmri what is it and how is it used in
studying memory this is actually the

3710
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:25,320
studying memory this is actually the
 

3711
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,229
studying memory this is actually the
reason why I got into this whole field

3712
01:13:27,229 --> 01:13:27,239
reason why I got into this whole field
 

3713
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:30,310
reason why I got into this whole field
of science is when I was in grad school

3714
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,320
of science is when I was in grad school
 

3715
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,149
of science is when I was in grad school
fmri was just really taking off as a

3716
01:13:33,149 --> 01:13:33,159
fmri was just really taking off as a
 

3717
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,750
fmri was just really taking off as a
technique for studying brain activity

3718
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:35,760
technique for studying brain activity
 

3719
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,790
technique for studying brain activity
and uh what's beautiful about it is you

3720
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:37,800
and uh what's beautiful about it is you
 

3721
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,830
and uh what's beautiful about it is you
can study the whole human brain and uh

3722
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:40,840
can study the whole human brain and uh
 

3723
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,030
can study the whole human brain and uh
there's lots of limits to it but you can

3724
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
there's lots of limits to it but you can
 

3725
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,270
there's lots of limits to it but you can
basically do it in person without

3726
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:45,280
basically do it in person without
 

3727
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:48,149
basically do it in person without
sticking anything into their brains and

3728
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:48,159
sticking anything into their brains and
 

3729
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,229
sticking anything into their brains and
very non-invasive I mean for me being an

3730
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:50,239
very non-invasive I mean for me being an
 

3731
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,030
very non-invasive I mean for me being an
MRI scanner is like being in the womb I

3732
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:52,040
MRI scanner is like being in the womb I
 

3733
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,629
MRI scanner is like being in the womb I
just fall asleep if I'm not being asked

3734
01:13:54,629 --> 01:13:54,639
just fall asleep if I'm not being asked
 

3735
01:13:54,639 --> 01:13:56,510
just fall asleep if I'm not being asked
to do it anything I get very sleepy you

3736
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:56,520
to do it anything I get very sleepy you
 

3737
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,629
to do it anything I get very sleepy you
know um but you can have people watch

3738
01:13:59,629 --> 01:13:59,639
know um but you can have people watch
 

3739
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:01,310
know um but you can have people watch
movies while they're being scanned or

3740
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:01,320
movies while they're being scanned or
 

3741
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,149
movies while they're being scanned or
you can have them do tests of memory

3742
01:14:03,149 --> 01:14:03,159
you can have them do tests of memory
 

3743
01:14:03,159 --> 01:14:05,310
you can have them do tests of memory
like giving them words and so forth to

3744
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:05,320
like giving them words and so forth to
 

3745
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:08,950
like giving them words and so forth to
memorize uh but what MRI is itself is

3746
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:08,960
memorize uh but what MRI is itself is
 

3747
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,830
memorize uh but what MRI is itself is
just this technique where you put people

3748
01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:11,840
just this technique where you put people
 

3749
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:15,470
just this technique where you put people
in a very high magnetic field typical

3750
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:15,480
in a very high magnetic field typical
 

3751
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,350
in a very high magnetic field typical
ones we would use would be three Tesla

3752
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
ones we would use would be three Tesla
 

3753
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,830
ones we would use would be three Tesla
to give you an idea so a three Tesla

3754
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840
to give you an idea so a three Tesla
 

3755
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,149
to give you an idea so a three Tesla
magnet you put somebody in and what

3756
01:14:22,149 --> 01:14:22,159
magnet you put somebody in and what
 

3757
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,750
magnet you put somebody in and what
happens is you get this very weak but

3758
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:24,760
happens is you get this very weak but
 

3759
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,310
happens is you get this very weak but
you know measurable magnetization in the

3760
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:27,320
you know measurable magnetization in the
 

3761
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,709
you know measurable magnetization in the
brain and then you apply a radio

3762
01:14:29,709 --> 01:14:29,719
brain and then you apply a radio
 

3763
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:31,709
brain and then you apply a radio
frequency pulse which is basically a

3764
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:31,719
frequency pulse which is basically a
 

3765
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:34,270
frequency pulse which is basically a
different electromagnetic field and so

3766
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:34,280
different electromagnetic field and so
 

3767
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,550
different electromagnetic field and so
you're basically using water the water

3768
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,560
you're basically using water the water
 

3769
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,950
you're basically using water the water
molecules in the brain as a tracer so to

3770
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:38,960
molecules in the brain as a tracer so to
 

3771
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,310
molecules in the brain as a tracer so to
speak um and uh part of it in fmri is

3772
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:43,320
speak um and uh part of it in fmri is
 

3773
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,390
speak um and uh part of it in fmri is
the fact that these magnetic fields that

3774
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:46,400
the fact that these magnetic fields that
 

3775
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,669
the fact that these magnetic fields that
you mess with by by

3776
01:14:48,669 --> 01:14:48,679
you mess with by by
 

3777
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:51,390
you mess with by by
manipulating um these radio frequency

3778
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:51,400
manipulating um these radio frequency
 

3779
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,270
manipulating um these radio frequency
pulses and the static field and you have

3780
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:54,280
pulses and the static field and you have
 

3781
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:56,070
pulses and the static field and you have
things called GR R would change the

3782
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:56,080
things called GR R would change the
 

3783
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,550
things called GR R would change the
strength of the magnetic field in

3784
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:57,560
strength of the magnetic field in
 

3785
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,149
strength of the magnetic field in
different parts of the head so they're

3786
01:14:59,149 --> 01:14:59,159
different parts of the head so they're
 

3787
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:01,270
different parts of the head so they're
all we tweak them in different ways but

3788
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:01,280
all we tweak them in different ways but
 

3789
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:04,510
all we tweak them in different ways but
the basic idea that we use in eim is

3790
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:04,520
the basic idea that we use in eim is
 

3791
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:07,870
the basic idea that we use in eim is
that blood is Flowing to the brain and

3792
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:07,880
that blood is Flowing to the brain and
 

3793
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,790
that blood is Flowing to the brain and
when you have blood that doesn't have

3794
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:09,800
when you have blood that doesn't have
 

3795
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,110
when you have blood that doesn't have
oxygen on it it's a little bit more

3796
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:12,120
oxygen on it it's a little bit more
 

3797
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,030
oxygen on it it's a little bit more
magnetizable than blood that does

3798
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:14,040
magnetizable than blood that does
 

3799
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,910
magnetizable than blood that does
because you have hemoglobin that carries

3800
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:15,920
because you have hemoglobin that carries
 

3801
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,270
because you have hemoglobin that carries
the oxygen the iron basically in the

3802
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:18,280
the oxygen the iron basically in the
 

3803
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,229
the oxygen the iron basically in the
blood that makes it red and so that

3804
01:15:21,229 --> 01:15:21,239
blood that makes it red and so that
 

3805
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:23,669
blood that makes it red and so that
hemoglobin when it's deoxygenated

3806
01:15:23,669 --> 01:15:23,679
hemoglobin when it's deoxygenated
 

3807
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,910
hemoglobin when it's deoxygenated
actually um has different magnetic field

3808
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:26,920
actually um has different magnetic field
 

3809
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,430
actually um has different magnetic field
properties than when it has oxygen and

3810
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:29,440
properties than when it has oxygen and
 

3811
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,830
properties than when it has oxygen and
it turns out when you have an increase

3812
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:31,840
it turns out when you have an increase
 

3813
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,629
it turns out when you have an increase
in local activity in some part of the

3814
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:33,639
in local activity in some part of the
 

3815
01:15:33,639 --> 01:15:36,629
in local activity in some part of the
brain the blood flows there and as a

3816
01:15:36,629 --> 01:15:36,639
brain the blood flows there and as a
 

3817
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:41,030
brain the blood flows there and as a
result you get a lower concentration of

3818
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,040
result you get a lower concentration of
 

3819
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,270
result you get a lower concentration of
hemoglobin that is not oxygenated and

3820
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:45,280
hemoglobin that is not oxygenated and
 

3821
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,590
hemoglobin that is not oxygenated and
then that gives you more signal so I

3822
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:48,600
then that gives you more signal so I
 

3823
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,910
then that gives you more signal so I
gave you I think I sent you a gif as you

3824
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:51,920
gave you I think I sent you a gif as you
 

3825
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,990
gave you I think I sent you a gif as you
like to say yeah we had off record in

3826
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:55,000
like to say yeah we had off record in
 

3827
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,790
like to say yeah we had off record in
intense argument uh about if it's

3828
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:57,800
intense argument uh about if it's
 

3829
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,790
intense argument uh about if it's
pronounced GIF or GIF but that's we we

3830
01:15:59,790 --> 01:15:59,800
pronounced GIF or GIF but that's we we
 

3831
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:02,430
pronounced GIF or GIF but that's we we
shall set that aside as friends we could

3832
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:02,440
shall set that aside as friends we could
 

3833
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,629
shall set that aside as friends we could
have called it a Stern rebuke perhaps

3834
01:16:04,629 --> 01:16:04,639
have called it a Stern rebuke perhaps
 

3835
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:09,310
have called it a Stern rebuke perhaps
but rebuke yeah I drew a hard line uh it

3836
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:09,320
but rebuke yeah I drew a hard line uh it
 

3837
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,390
but rebuke yeah I drew a hard line uh it
is true the creator of gift said it's

3838
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:11,400
is true the creator of gift said it's
 

3839
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,950
is true the creator of gift said it's
pronounced GIF but that's the only

3840
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:12,960
pronounced GIF but that's the only
 

3841
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,070
pronounced GIF but that's the only
person that pronounces gif anyway yes

3842
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
person that pronounces gif anyway yes
 

3843
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:19,750
person that pronounces gif anyway yes
you sent a GI uh a gif of uh this would

3844
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:19,760
you sent a GI uh a gif of uh this would
 

3845
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,790
you sent a GI uh a gif of uh this would
be basically a whole a movie of fmri

3846
01:16:23,790 --> 01:16:23,800
be basically a whole a movie of fmri
 

3847
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,430
be basically a whole a movie of fmri
data and so when you look at it's not

3848
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:25,440
data and so when you look at it's not
 

3849
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:27,189
data and so when you look at it's not
very impressive it looks like these like

3850
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:27,199
very impressive it looks like these like
 

3851
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:29,830
very impressive it looks like these like
very pixelated maps of the brain but

3852
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
very pixelated maps of the brain but
 

3853
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,510
very pixelated maps of the brain but
it's mostly kind of like white but these

3854
01:16:32,510 --> 01:16:32,520
it's mostly kind of like white but these
 

3855
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,149
it's mostly kind of like white but these
tiny changes in the intensity of those

3856
01:16:35,149 --> 01:16:35,159
tiny changes in the intensity of those
 

3857
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:36,629
tiny changes in the intensity of those
signals that you probably wouldn't be

3858
01:16:36,629 --> 01:16:36,639
signals that you probably wouldn't be
 

3859
01:16:36,639 --> 01:16:39,750
signals that you probably wouldn't be
able to visually perceive like about 1%

3860
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:39,760
able to visually perceive like about 1%
 

3861
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,790
able to visually perceive like about 1%
can be statistically very very large

3862
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:41,800
can be statistically very very large
 

3863
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,709
can be statistically very very large
effects for us and that allows us to see

3864
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:44,719
effects for us and that allows us to see
 

3865
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:46,910
effects for us and that allows us to see
hey there's an increase in activity in

3866
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:46,920
hey there's an increase in activity in
 

3867
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,310
hey there's an increase in activity in
some part of the brain when I'm doing

3868
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:49,320
some part of the brain when I'm doing
 

3869
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,030
some part of the brain when I'm doing
some task like trying to remember

3870
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
some task like trying to remember
 

3871
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,750
some task like trying to remember
something and I can use those changes to

3872
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
something and I can use those changes to
 

3873
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,229
something and I can use those changes to
even predict is a person going to

3874
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:56,239
even predict is a person going to
 

3875
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,669
even predict is a person going to
remember this later or not and the

3876
01:16:58,669 --> 01:16:58,679
remember this later or not and the
 

3877
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:00,550
remember this later or not and the
coolest thing that people have done is

3878
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:00,560
coolest thing that people have done is
 

3879
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:01,350
coolest thing that people have done is
to

3880
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
to
 

3881
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:04,870
to
decode um what people are remembering

3882
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:04,880
decode um what people are remembering
 

3883
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,189
decode um what people are remembering
from the patterns of activity from

3884
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:07,199
from the patterns of activity from
 

3885
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,790
from the patterns of activity from
because maybe when I'm remembering this

3886
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:08,800
because maybe when I'm remembering this
 

3887
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,110
because maybe when I'm remembering this
thing like I'm remembering the house

3888
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,120
thing like I'm remembering the house
 

3889
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,030
thing like I'm remembering the house
where I grew up I might have one pixel

3890
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:14,040
where I grew up I might have one pixel
 

3891
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:15,629
where I grew up I might have one pixel
that's bright in the hippoc campus and

3892
01:17:15,629 --> 01:17:15,639
that's bright in the hippoc campus and
 

3893
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:18,669
that's bright in the hippoc campus and
one that's dark and if I'm remembering

3894
01:17:18,669 --> 01:17:18,679
one that's dark and if I'm remembering
 

3895
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:21,270
one that's dark and if I'm remembering
uh you know something like more like uh

3896
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:21,280
uh you know something like more like uh
 

3897
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,709
uh you know something like more like uh
uh the car that I used to drive when I

3898
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:22,719
uh the car that I used to drive when I
 

3899
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:24,709
uh the car that I used to drive when I
was 16 I might see the opposite pattern

3900
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:24,719
was 16 I might see the opposite pattern
 

3901
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:26,870
was 16 I might see the opposite pattern
where a different pixels spray and so

3902
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:26,880
where a different pixels spray and so
 

3903
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,270
where a different pixels spray and so
all that little stuff that we used to

3904
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:28,280
all that little stuff that we used to
 

3905
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,870
all that little stuff that we used to
think of noise uh we can now think of

3906
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:30,880
think of noise uh we can now think of
 

3907
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:33,229
think of noise uh we can now think of
almost like a QR code for memory so to

3908
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:33,239
almost like a QR code for memory so to
 

3909
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:34,910
almost like a QR code for memory so to
speak where different memories have a

3910
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:34,920
speak where different memories have a
 

3911
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:37,350
speak where different memories have a
different little pattern of bright

3912
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:37,360
different little pattern of bright
 

3913
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,229
different little pattern of bright
pixels and dark pixels and so this

3914
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:39,239
pixels and dark pixels and so this
 

3915
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,629
pixels and dark pixels and so this
really revolutionized my research so

3916
01:17:41,629 --> 01:17:41,639
really revolutionized my research so
 

3917
01:17:41,639 --> 01:17:43,350
really revolutionized my research so
there's fancy research out there where

3918
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:43,360
there's fancy research out there where
 

3919
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,310
there's fancy research out there where
people really I mean not even that I

3920
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:45,320
people really I mean not even that I
 

3921
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,750
people really I mean not even that I
mean by your standards this would be

3922
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:46,760
mean by your standards this would be
 

3923
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,870
mean by your standards this would be
stone age but you know a flying machine

3924
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:48,880
stone age but you know a flying machine
 

3925
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,910
stone age but you know a flying machine
learning techniques to do decoding and

3926
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:50,920
learning techniques to do decoding and
 

3927
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:52,790
learning techniques to do decoding and
so forth and now there's a lot of

3928
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
so forth and now there's a lot of
 

3929
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,990
so forth and now there's a lot of
forward encoding models and you you can

3930
01:17:54,990 --> 01:17:55,000
forward encoding models and you you can
 

3931
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,270
forward encoding models and you you can
go to town with this stuff right and I'm

3932
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:58,280
go to town with this stuff right and I'm
 

3933
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,550
go to town with this stuff right and I'm
much more old school of Designing

3934
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:00,560
much more old school of Designing
 

3935
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,990
much more old school of Designing
experiments where you basically say okay

3936
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:03,000
experiments where you basically say okay
 

3937
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,910
experiments where you basically say okay
here's a whole web of inter of memories

3938
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:05,920
here's a whole web of inter of memories
 

3939
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,629
here's a whole web of inter of memories
that overlap in some way shape or form

3940
01:18:08,629 --> 01:18:08,639
that overlap in some way shape or form
 

3941
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,149
that overlap in some way shape or form
do memories that occurred in the same

3942
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:11,159
do memories that occurred in the same
 

3943
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:14,470
do memories that occurred in the same
place have a similar QR code and do

3944
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
place have a similar QR code and do
 

3945
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,750
place have a similar QR code and do
memories that occur in different places

3946
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:15,760
memories that occur in different places
 

3947
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,669
memories that occur in different places
have a different QR code and you can

3948
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
have a different QR code and you can
 

3949
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,790
have a different QR code and you can
just use things like correlation

3950
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:19,800
just use things like correlation
 

3951
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:21,790
just use things like correlation
coefficients or cosine distance to

3952
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:21,800
coefficients or cosine distance to
 

3953
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:24,149
coefficients or cosine distance to
measure that stuff right super simple

3954
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
measure that stuff right super simple
 

3955
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:26,470
measure that stuff right super simple
right and so what happens is you can

3956
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:26,480
right and so what happens is you can
 

3957
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,110
right and so what happens is you can
start to get a whole state space of how

3958
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,120
start to get a whole state space of how
 

3959
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,790
start to get a whole state space of how
a brain area is indexing all these

3960
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:31,800
a brain area is indexing all these
 

3961
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,110
a brain area is indexing all these
different memories it's super

3962
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,120
different memories it's super
 

3963
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,110
different memories it's super
fascinating because what we could see is

3964
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,120
fascinating because what we could see is
 

3965
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:38,510
fascinating because what we could see is
this little like separation between how

3966
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:38,520
this little like separation between how
 

3967
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,149
this little like separation between how
certain brain areas are processing

3968
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:40,159
certain brain areas are processing
 

3969
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,629
certain brain areas are processing
memory for who was there in other brain

3970
01:18:42,629 --> 01:18:42,639
memory for who was there in other brain
 

3971
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:44,189
memory for who was there in other brain
areas of processing information about

3972
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:44,199
areas of processing information about
 

3973
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:46,790
areas of processing information about
where it occurred or the situation

3974
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:46,800
where it occurred or the situation
 

3975
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,750
where it occurred or the situation
that's kind of unfolding and some are

3976
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:48,760
that's kind of unfolding and some are
 

3977
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:51,070
that's kind of unfolding and some are
giving you information about what are my

3978
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:51,080
giving you information about what are my
 

3979
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,750
giving you information about what are my
goals that are involved and so forth and

3980
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:53,760
goals that are involved and so forth and
 

3981
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,310
goals that are involved and so forth and
so and H campus is just putting it all

3982
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:56,320
so and H campus is just putting it all
 

3983
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,390
so and H campus is just putting it all
together into these unique things that

3984
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400
together into these unique things that
 

3985
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,149
together into these unique things that
just are about when and where it

3986
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:00,159
just are about when and where it
 

3987
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:02,669
just are about when and where it
happened so there is a separation

3988
01:19:02,669 --> 01:19:02,679
happened so there is a separation
 

3989
01:19:02,679 --> 01:19:05,310
happened so there is a separation
between spatial

3990
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:05,320
between spatial
 

3991
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,189
between spatial

Concepts like literally there's distinct

3994
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:11,080
Concepts like literally there's distinct
 

3995
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,709
Concepts like literally there's distinct
as you said QR codes for these so to

3996
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:13,719
as you said QR codes for these so to
 

3997
01:19:13,719 --> 01:19:15,790
as you said QR codes for these so to
speak let me try a different analogy too

3998
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:15,800
speak let me try a different analogy too
 

3999
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,430
speak let me try a different analogy too
that might be more accessible for people

4000
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:18,440
that might be more accessible for people
 

4001
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:20,110
that might be more accessible for people
which should be like uh You' got a

4002
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:20,120
which should be like uh You' got a
 

4003
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,270
which should be like uh You' got a
folder on your computer right I open it

4004
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:22,280
folder on your computer right I open it
 

4005
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,270
folder on your computer right I open it
up there's a bunch of files there I can

4006
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:24,280
up there's a bunch of files there I can
 

4007
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:27,110
up there's a bunch of files there I can
sort those files by you know

4008
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,120
sort those files by you know
 

4009
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:29,629
sort those files by you know
alphabetical order and now things that

4010
01:19:29,629 --> 01:19:29,639
alphabetical order and now things that
 

4011
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,310
alphabetical order and now things that
both start with letter A are lumped

4012
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:31,320
both start with letter A are lumped
 

4013
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,510
both start with letter A are lumped
together and things that start with Z

4014
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:33,520
together and things that start with Z
 

4015
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,830
together and things that start with Z
versus a are far apart right and so that

4016
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:36,840
versus a are far apart right and so that
 

4017
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:38,629
versus a are far apart right and so that
is one way of organizing the folder but

4018
01:19:38,629 --> 01:19:38,639
is one way of organizing the folder but
 

4019
01:19:38,639 --> 01:19:40,830
is one way of organizing the folder but
I could do it by date and if I do it by

4020
01:19:40,830 --> 01:19:40,840
I could do it by date and if I do it by
 

4021
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,189
I could do it by date and if I do it by
date things that were created close

4022
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:43,199
date things that were created close
 

4023
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:44,910
date things that were created close
together in time are close and things

4024
01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:44,920
together in time are close and things
 

4025
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,110
together in time are close and things
that are far apart in time are far so

4026
01:19:48,110 --> 01:19:48,120
that are far apart in time are far so
 

4027
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,790
that are far apart in time are far so
every like you can think of how a brain

4028
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:50,800
every like you can think of how a brain
 

4029
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,430
every like you can think of how a brain
area or a network of areas contributes

4030
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:53,440
area or a network of areas contributes
 

4031
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,790
area or a network of areas contributes
to memory by looking at what the Sorting

4032
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:55,800
to memory by looking at what the Sorting
 

4033
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,390
to memory by looking at what the Sorting
scheme is and these QR codes that we're

4034
01:19:59,390 --> 01:19:59,400
scheme is and these QR codes that we're
 

4035
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,070

01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:01,080
talking about that you get from FM or
 

4037
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,149
talking about that you get from FM or
allow you to do that and you can do the

4038
01:20:03,149 --> 01:20:03,159
allow you to do that and you can do the
 

4039
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:04,590
allow you to do that and you can do the
same thing if you're recording from

01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:04,600
same thing if you're recording from
 

4041
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,910
same thing if you're recording from
massive populations of neurons in uh an

01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
massive populations of neurons in uh an
 

4043
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,149
massive populations of neurons in uh an
animal um and you can do it for

01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:10,159
animal um and you can do it for
 

4045
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:13,430
animal um and you can do it for
recording local Potentials in the brain

4046
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:13,440
recording local Potentials in the brain
 

4047
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,750
recording local Potentials in the brain
you know so little um waves of activity

4048
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:16,760
you know so little um waves of activity
 

4049
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,189
you know so little um waves of activity
in let's say a human who has epilepsy

4050
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:19,199
in let's say a human who has epilepsy
 

4051
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:20,790
in let's say a human who has epilepsy
and they stick electrodes in their brain

4052
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:20,800
and they stick electrodes in their brain
 

4053
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,669
and they stick electrodes in their brain
try to find the seizures so that's some

4054
01:20:22,669 --> 01:20:22,679
try to find the seizures so that's some
 

4055
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:25,189
try to find the seizures so that's some
of the work that we're doing now but all

4056
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:25,199
of the work that we're doing now but all
 

4057
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:27,030
of the work that we're doing now but all
these techniques basically allow you to

4058
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:27,040
these techniques basically allow you to
 

4059
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,430
these techniques basically allow you to
say hey what's the Sorting scheme and so

4060
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:30,440
say hey what's the Sorting scheme and so
 

4061
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,030
say hey what's the Sorting scheme and so
we've found that some networks of the

4062
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:32,040
we've found that some networks of the
 

4063
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,910
we've found that some networks of the
brain sort information in memory

4064
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:34,920
brain sort information in memory
 

4065
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,110
brain sort information in memory
according to who was there so I might

4066
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:37,120
according to who was there so I might
 

4067
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,910
according to who was there so I might
have like we've actually shown in one of

4068
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:39,920
have like we've actually shown in one of
 

4069
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,669
have like we've actually shown in one of
my favorite studies of all time that was

4070
01:20:41,669 --> 01:20:41,679
my favorite studies of all time that was
 

4071
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:44,669
my favorite studies of all time that was
done by a former post Zach rehea and

4072
01:20:44,669 --> 01:20:44,679
done by a former post Zach rehea and
 

4073
01:20:44,679 --> 01:20:47,189
done by a former post Zach rehea and
Zach did the study where we had a bunch

4074
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,199
Zach did the study where we had a bunch
 

4075
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,590
Zach did the study where we had a bunch
of movies with different people in my

4076
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:49,600
of movies with different people in my
 

4077
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,030
of movies with different people in my
labs are two different people and he

4078
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,040
labs are two different people and he
 

4079
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,510
labs are two different people and he
filmed them at two different cafes and

4080
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:53,520
filmed them at two different cafes and
 

4081
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,430
filmed them at two different cafes and
two different supermarkets

4082
01:20:55,430 --> 01:20:55,440
two different supermarkets
 

4083
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:57,390
two different supermarkets
and what you could show is in one

4084
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:57,400
and what you could show is in one
 

4085
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,229
and what you could show is in one
particular Network you could find the

4086
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:00,239
particular Network you could find the
 

4087
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:02,950
particular Network you could find the
same kind of pattern of activity more or

4088
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:02,960
same kind of pattern of activity more or
 

4089
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,750
same kind of pattern of activity more or
less a very very similar pattern of

4090
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:04,760
less a very very similar pattern of
 

4091
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:08,310
less a very very similar pattern of
activity every time I saw Alex in one of

4092
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:08,320
activity every time I saw Alex in one of
 

4093
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,229
activity every time I saw Alex in one of
these movies no matter where he was

4094
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:10,239
these movies no matter where he was
 

4095
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,550
these movies no matter where he was
right and I could see another one that

4096
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:12,560
right and I could see another one that
 

4097
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,270
right and I could see another one that
was like a common uh pattern that

4098
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:15,280
was like a common uh pattern that
 

4099
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,110
was like a common uh pattern that
happened every time I saw this

4100
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:17,120
happened every time I saw this
 

4101
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,990
happened every time I saw this
particular Supermarket nugget you know

4102
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,000
particular Supermarket nugget you know
 

4103
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,830
particular Supermarket nugget you know
and so and it didn't matter whether

4104
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:21,840
and so and it didn't matter whether
 

4105
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:23,750
and so and it didn't matter whether
you're watching a movie or whether

4106
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:23,760
you're watching a movie or whether
 

4107
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,830
you're watching a movie or whether
you're recalling the movie was the same

4108
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:25,840
you're recalling the movie was the same
 

4109
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,470
you're recalling the movie was the same
kind of pattern that comes up right

4110
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:27,480
kind of pattern that comes up right
 

4111
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,470
kind of pattern that comes up right
that's so fascinating it fascinating so

4112
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:29,480
that's so fascinating it fascinating so
 

4113
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,669
that's so fascinating it fascinating so
now you have those building blocks for

4114
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:31,679
now you have those building blocks for
 

4115
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,270
now you have those building blocks for
assembling a model of what's happening

4116
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:34,280
assembling a model of what's happening
 

4117
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:37,070
assembling a model of what's happening
in the present imagining what could

01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:37,080
in the present imagining what could
 

4119
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,470
in the present imagining what could
happen and remembering things very

economically from putting together all
 

4123
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:42,709
economically from putting together all
these pieces so that all the hippocampus

4124
01:21:42,709 --> 01:21:42,719
these pieces so that all the hippocampus
 

4125
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,350
these pieces so that all the hippocampus
has to do is get the right kind of

4126
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360
has to do is get the right kind of
 

4127
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,070
has to do is get the right kind of
blueprint for how to put together all

01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:55,880
system it makes me wonder on the other
 

4135
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,910
system it makes me wonder on the other
side of it how to build it but it's like

4136
01:21:58,910 --> 01:21:58,920
side of it how to build it but it's like
 

4137
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,030
side of it how to build it but it's like
it's fascinating like the way it does

01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,310
it's fascinating like the way it does
the encoding is really really

4140
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:02,320
the encoding is really really
 

4141
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:05,350
the encoding is really really
fascinating or I guess the symptoms the

4142
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:05,360
fascinating or I guess the symptoms the
 

4143
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,030
fascinating or I guess the symptoms the
results of that encoding are fascinating

4144
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:07,040
results of that encoding are fascinating
 

4145
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,149
results of that encoding are fascinating
to study from this just as a small

4146
01:22:09,149 --> 01:22:09,159
to study from this just as a small
 

4147

to study from this just as a small
tangent you mentioned sort of the uh

4148
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:12,280
tangent you mentioned sort of the uh

measuring local potentials with

4150
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:14,000
measuring local potentials with
 

4151
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,750
measuring local potentials with
electrodes versus fmri oh yeah what are

4152
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:17,760
electrodes versus fmri oh yeah what are
 

4153
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,070
electrodes versus fmri oh yeah what are
some interesting like um limitations

4154
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:21,080
some interesting like um limitations
 

4155
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:24,189
some interesting like um limitations
possibilities of fmri maybe the way you

4156
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:24,199
possibilities of fmri maybe the way you
 

4157
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:25,830
possibilities of fmri maybe the way you
explain is like brilliant with with

4158
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:25,840
explain is like brilliant with with
 

4159
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,870
explain is like brilliant with with
blood and it's detecting the um the

4160
01:22:29,870 --> 01:22:29,880
blood and it's detecting the um the
 

4161
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:32,870
blood and it's detecting the um the
activations or the excitation because

4162
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:32,880
activations or the excitation because
 

4163
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,669
activations or the excitation because
blood flows to that area what's like the

4164
01:22:34,669 --> 01:22:34,679
blood flows to that area what's like the
 

4165
01:22:34,679 --> 01:22:37,270
blood flows to that area what's like the
latency of that like what's the blood

4166
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:37,280
latency of that like what's the blood
 

4167
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,990
latency of that like what's the blood
Dynamics in the brain that yeah like how

4168
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,000
Dynamics in the brain that yeah like how
 

4169
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,390
Dynamics in the brain that yeah like how
quickly can it how quickly can the task

4170
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:43,400
quickly can it how quickly can the task
 

4171
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,149
quickly can it how quickly can the task
change and all that kind of stuff yeah I

4172
01:22:45,149 --> 01:22:45,159
change and all that kind of stuff yeah I
 

4173
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:49,070
change and all that kind of stuff yeah I
mean it's very slow to the brain 50

4174
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:49,080
mean it's very slow to the brain 50
 

4175
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,910
mean it's very slow to the brain 50
milliseconds is like you know like it's

4176
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:51,920
milliseconds is like you know like it's
 

4177
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,950
milliseconds is like you know like it's
an eternity uh like maybe not 50

4178
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960
an eternity uh like maybe not 50
 

4179
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,430
an eternity uh like maybe not 50
oh you know maybe like uh you know let's

4180
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:57,440
oh you know maybe like uh you know let's
 

4181
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,669
oh you know maybe like uh you know let's
say half a second 500 milliseconds just

4182
01:23:00,669 --> 01:23:00,679
say half a second 500 milliseconds just
 

4183
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:02,709
say half a second 500 milliseconds just
so much back and forth stuff happens in

4184
01:23:02,709 --> 01:23:02,719
so much back and forth stuff happens in
 

4185
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,830
so much back and forth stuff happens in
the brain in that time right so in fmri

4186
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:06,840
the brain in that time right so in fmri
 

4187
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,629
the brain in that time right so in fmri
you can measure these magnetic field

4188
01:23:08,629 --> 01:23:08,639
you can measure these magnetic field
 

4189
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,590
you can measure these magnetic field
responses about six seconds after that

4190
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:11,600
responses about six seconds after that
 

4191
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,270
responses about six seconds after that
burst of activity would take place all

4192
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:14,280
burst of activity would take place all
 

4193
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,070
burst of activity would take place all
these things it's like is it a feature

4194
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:16,080
these things it's like is it a feature
 

4195
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,990
these things it's like is it a feature
or is it a bug right so one of the

4196
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,000
or is it a bug right so one of the
 

4197
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,189
or is it a bug right so one of the
interesting things that's been

4198
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
interesting things that's been
 

4199
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:22,070
interesting things that's been
discovered about fmri is it's not so

4200
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,080
discovered about fmri is it's not so
 

4201
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:25,390
discovered about fmri is it's not so
tightly related to this spiking of the

4202
01:23:25,390 --> 01:23:25,400
tightly related to this spiking of the
 

4203
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,590
tightly related to this spiking of the
neurons so we tend to think of the

4204
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
neurons so we tend to think of the
 

4205
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,149
neurons so we tend to think of the
computation so to speak as being driven

4206
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:30,159
computation so to speak as being driven
 

4207
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,229
computation so to speak as being driven
by spikes meaning like there's just a

4208
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239
by spikes meaning like there's just a
 

4209
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,550
by spikes meaning like there's just a
burst of it's either on or it's off and

4210
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560
burst of it's either on or it's off and
 

4211
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,870
burst of it's either on or it's off and
the neurons like going up or down um but

4212
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:37,880
the neurons like going up or down um but
 

4213
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:39,990
the neurons like going up or down um but
sometimes what you can have is these

4214
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:40,000
sometimes what you can have is these
 

4215
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,390
sometimes what you can have is these
states where the neuron becomes a little

4216
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:42,400
states where the neuron becomes a little
 

4217
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,750
states where the neuron becomes a little
bit more excitable or less excitable and

4218
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:45,760
bit more excitable or less excitable and
 

4219
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,270
bit more excitable or less excitable and
so fmri is very sensitive to those

4220
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:48,280
so fmri is very sensitive to those
 

4221
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,990
so fmri is very sensitive to those
changes in excitability actually one of

4222
01:23:50,990 --> 01:23:51,000
changes in excitability actually one of
 

4223
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,430
changes in excitability actually one of
the fascinating things about fmri is

4224
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:54,440
the fascinating things about fmri is
 

4225
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,030
the fascinating things about fmri is
where does that how is it we go from

4226
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,040
where does that how is it we go from
 

4227
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:01,590
where does that how is it we go from
neural activity to you know essentially

4228
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:01,600
neural activity to you know essentially
 

4229
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,669
neural activity to you know essentially
blood flow to oxygen you know all this

4230
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
blood flow to oxygen you know all this
 

4231
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,629
blood flow to oxygen you know all this
stuff it's such a long chain of you know

4232
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:05,639
stuff it's such a long chain of you know
 

4233
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:07,550
stuff it's such a long chain of you know
going from neural activity to magnetic

4234
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:07,560
going from neural activity to magnetic
 

4235
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:09,830
going from neural activity to magnetic
fields and one of the theories that's

4236
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:09,840
fields and one of the theories that's
 

4237
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:12,750
fields and one of the theories that's
out there is you most of the cells in

4238
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:12,760
out there is you most of the cells in
 

4239
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,790
out there is you most of the cells in
the brain are not neurons they're

4240
01:24:14,790 --> 01:24:14,800
the brain are not neurons they're
 

4241
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,709
the brain are not neurons they're
actually these support cells called gal

4242
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719
actually these support cells called gal
 

4243
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,310
actually these support cells called gal
cells and one big one is asites and they

4244
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:19,320
cells and one big one is asites and they
 

4245
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,910
cells and one big one is asites and they
play this big role in regulating you

4246
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:21,920
play this big role in regulating you
 

4247
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,950
play this big role in regulating you
know kind of being a middle man so to

4248
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:23,960
know kind of being a middle man so to
 

4249
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,550
know kind of being a middle man so to
speak with the neurons so if you for

4250
01:24:26,550 --> 01:24:26,560
speak with the neurons so if you for
 

4251
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,430
speak with the neurons so if you for
instance like one neuron's talking to

4252
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:28,440
instance like one neuron's talking to
 

4253
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:30,430
instance like one neuron's talking to
another you release a neurotransmitter

4254
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:30,440
another you release a neurotransmitter
 

4255
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,629
another you release a neurotransmitter
like let's say glutamate and that gets

4256
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:32,639
like let's say glutamate and that gets
 

4257
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:34,750
like let's say glutamate and that gets
another neuron starts Talk starts

4258
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:34,760
another neuron starts Talk starts
 

4259
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:36,990
another neuron starts Talk starts
getting active after you release it in

4260
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:37,000
getting active after you release it in
 

4261
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,790
getting active after you release it in
the gap between the two neurons called

4262
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:38,800
the gap between the two neurons called
 

4263
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,030
the gap between the two neurons called
synapse so what's interesting is if you

4264
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:42,040
synapse so what's interesting is if you
 

4265
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,030
synapse so what's interesting is if you
leave that you know imagine you just

4266
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:44,040
leave that you know imagine you just
 

4267
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,270
leave that you know imagine you just
flooded with this like liquid in there

4268
01:24:46,270 --> 01:24:46,280
flooded with this like liquid in there
 

4269
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,430
flooded with this like liquid in there
right if you leave it in there too long

4270
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:48,440
right if you leave it in there too long
 

4271
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,109
right if you leave it in there too long
you just excite the other neuron too

4272
01:24:50,109 --> 01:24:50,119
you just excite the other neuron too
 

4273
01:24:50,119 --> 01:24:51,430
you just excite the other neuron too
much and you can start to basically get

4274
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:51,440
much and you can start to basically get
 

4275
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,709
much and you can start to basically get
seizure activity you don't want this so

4276
01:24:53,709 --> 01:24:53,719
seizure activity you don't want this so
 

4277
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:55,750
seizure activity you don't want this so
you got to suck up and so actually what

4278
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:55,760
you got to suck up and so actually what
 

4279
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,189
you got to suck up and so actually what
happens is these asites one of their

4280
01:24:58,189 --> 01:24:58,199
happens is these asites one of their
 

4281
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:00,830
happens is these asites one of their
functions is to suck up the uh um

4282
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:00,840
functions is to suck up the uh um
 

4283
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,870
functions is to suck up the uh um
glutamate from the synapse and that is a

4284
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:03,880
glutamate from the synapse and that is a
 

4285
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,790
glutamate from the synapse and that is a
massively and then break it down and

4286
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:05,800
massively and then break it down and
 

4287
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,590
massively and then break it down and
then feed it back into the neurons so

4288
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
then feed it back into the neurons so
 

4289
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,790
then feed it back into the neurons so
that you can reuse it but that cycling

4290
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:09,800
that you can reuse it but that cycling
 

4291
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,629
that you can reuse it but that cycling
is actually very energy intensive and

4292
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:12,639
is actually very energy intensive and
 

4293
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:14,510
is actually very energy intensive and
what's interesting is at least according

4294
01:25:14,510 --> 01:25:14,520
what's interesting is at least according
 

4295
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:16,910
what's interesting is at least according
to one Theory and they need to work so

4296
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:16,920
to one Theory and they need to work so
 

4297
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:19,270
to one Theory and they need to work so
quickly that they're working on

4298
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280
quickly that they're working on
 

4299
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,830
quickly that they're working on
metabolizing the glucose that comes in

4300
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:21,840
metabolizing the glucose that comes in
 

4301
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:24,870
metabolizing the glucose that comes in
without using oxygen uh kind of like

4302
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:24,880
without using oxygen uh kind of like
 

4303
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:26,709
without using oxygen uh kind of like
what you know anerobic metabolism so

4304
01:25:26,709 --> 01:25:26,719
what you know anerobic metabolism so
 

4305
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:30,390
what you know anerobic metabolism so
they're not using oxygen as fast as they

4306
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:30,400
they're not using oxygen as fast as they
 

4307
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,470
they're not using oxygen as fast as they
are using glucose so what we're really

4308
01:25:33,470 --> 01:25:33,480
are using glucose so what we're really
 

4309
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,229
are using glucose so what we're really
seeing in some ways may be in fmri not

4310
01:25:37,229 --> 01:25:37,239
seeing in some ways may be in fmri not
 

4311
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:40,030
seeing in some ways may be in fmri not
the neurons themselves being active but

4312
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:40,040
the neurons themselves being active but
 

4313
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:43,149
the neurons themselves being active but
rather the asites which are meeting the

4314
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:43,159
rather the asites which are meeting the
 

4315
01:25:43,159 --> 01:25:45,390
rather the asites which are meeting the
metabolic demands of the process of

4316
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:45,400
metabolic demands of the process of
 

4317
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,430
metabolic demands of the process of
keeping the whole system going it does

4318
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:47,440
keeping the whole system going it does
 

4319
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,910
keeping the whole system going it does
seem to be that fmri is a good way to

4320
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:50,920
seem to be that fmri is a good way to
 

4321
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:53,750
seem to be that fmri is a good way to
study Activation so with these estros

4322
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:53,760
study Activation so with these estros
 

4323
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:54,790
study Activation so with these estros
sites

4324
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:54,800
sites
 

4325
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,030
sites
even though there's a

4326
01:25:56,030 --> 01:25:56,040
even though there's a
 

4327
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,590
even though there's a
latency it's pretty reliably coupled to

4328
01:25:59,590 --> 01:25:59,600
latency it's pretty reliably coupled to
 

4329
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:01,990
latency it's pretty reliably coupled to
the activations oh well this gets me to

4330
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:02,000
the activations oh well this gets me to
 

4331
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,510
the activations oh well this gets me to
the other part about so now let's say

4332
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:04,520
the other part about so now let's say
 

4333
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:06,070
the other part about so now let's say
for instance if I'm just kind of like

4334
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:06,080
for instance if I'm just kind of like
 

4335
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,390
for instance if I'm just kind of like
I'm talking to you but I'm kind of

4336
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:07,400
I'm talking to you but I'm kind of
 

4337
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,070
I'm talking to you but I'm kind of
paying attention to your cowboy hat

4338
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:09,080
paying attention to your cowboy hat
 

4339
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,950
paying attention to your cowboy hat
right so I'm looking off to the I'm

4340
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:10,960
right so I'm looking off to the I'm
 

4341
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,470
right so I'm looking off to the I'm
thinking about the right even if I'm not

4342
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
thinking about the right even if I'm not
 

4343
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,629
thinking about the right even if I'm not
looking at it what you'd see is is that

4344
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:14,639
looking at it what you'd see is is that
 

4345
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,390
looking at it what you'd see is is that
there would be this little elevation in

4346
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:17,400
there would be this little elevation in
 

4347
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,270
there would be this little elevation in
activity in areas in the visual cortex

4348
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:21,280
activity in areas in the visual cortex
 

4349
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,750
activity in areas in the visual cortex
you which process Vision around around

4350
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:24,760
you which process Vision around around
 

4351
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,109
you which process Vision around around
that point in space okay so if then

4352
01:26:28,109 --> 01:26:28,119
that point in space okay so if then
 

4353
01:26:28,119 --> 01:26:29,629
that point in space okay so if then
something happened like you know a

4354
01:26:29,629 --> 01:26:29,639
something happened like you know a
 

4355
01:26:29,639 --> 01:26:31,709
something happened like you know a
sudden a light flashed in that part of

4356
01:26:31,709 --> 01:26:31,719
sudden a light flashed in that part of
 

4357
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,070
sudden a light flashed in that part of
of you know right in front of your

4358
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:33,080
of you know right in front of your
 

4359
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:35,430
of you know right in front of your
cowboy hat I would have a bigger

4360
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:35,440
cowboy hat I would have a bigger
 

4361
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,070
cowboy hat I would have a bigger
response to it but what you see in fmar

4362
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:38,080
response to it but what you see in fmar
 

4363
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,910
response to it but what you see in fmar
is even if I'm not even if I don't see

4364
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:39,920
is even if I'm not even if I don't see
 

4365
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:41,470
is even if I'm not even if I don't see
that flash of light there's a lot of

4366
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:41,480
that flash of light there's a lot of
 

4367
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,669
that flash of light there's a lot of
activity that I can measure because

4368
01:26:43,669 --> 01:26:43,679
activity that I can measure because
 

4369
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,550
activity that I can measure because
you're kind of keeping it excitable and

4370
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:45,560
you're kind of keeping it excitable and
 

4371
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:48,270
you're kind of keeping it excitable and
that in and of itself even though I'm

4372
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:48,280
that in and of itself even though I'm
 

4373
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,990
that in and of itself even though I'm
not seeing anything there that's

4374
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,000
not seeing anything there that's
 

4375
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,990
not seeing anything there that's
particularly interesting there's still

4376
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:52,000
particularly interesting there's still
 

4377
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,870
particularly interesting there's still
this increase in activity and so it's

4378
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:53,880
this increase in activity and so it's
 

4379
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,229
this increase in activity and so it's
more sensitive with ephor so that is

4380
01:26:56,229 --> 01:26:56,239
more sensitive with ephor so that is
 

4381
01:26:56,239 --> 01:26:57,750
more sensitive with ephor so that is
that a feature or is it a bug you know

4382
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:57,760
that a feature or is it a bug you know
 

4383
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,109
that a feature or is it a bug you know
some people people who study spikes in

4384
01:27:00,109 --> 01:27:00,119
some people people who study spikes in
 

4385
01:27:00,119 --> 01:27:01,709
some people people who study spikes in
neurons would say well that's terrible

4386
01:27:01,709 --> 01:27:01,719
neurons would say well that's terrible
 

4387
01:27:01,719 --> 01:27:04,350
neurons would say well that's terrible
we don't want that you know uh likewise

4388
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:04,360
we don't want that you know uh likewise
 

4389
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,109
we don't want that you know uh likewise
it's slow and that's terrible for

4390
01:27:07,109 --> 01:27:07,119
it's slow and that's terrible for
 

4391
01:27:07,119 --> 01:27:10,149
it's slow and that's terrible for
measuring things that are very fast but

4392
01:27:10,149 --> 01:27:10,159
measuring things that are very fast but
 

4393
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,870
measuring things that are very fast but
one of the things that we found in our

4394
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:11,880
one of the things that we found in our
 

4395
01:27:11,880 --> 01:27:13,790
one of the things that we found in our
work was when we give people movies and

4396
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:13,800
work was when we give people movies and
 

4397
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,270
work was when we give people movies and
when we give people stories to listen to

4398
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:17,280
when we give people stories to listen to
 

4399
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,229
when we give people stories to listen to
a lot of the action is in the very very

4400
01:27:19,229 --> 01:27:19,239
a lot of the action is in the very very
 

4401
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:21,470
a lot of the action is in the very very
slow stuff it's in because if you're

4402
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:21,480
slow stuff it's in because if you're
 

4403
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:24,310
slow stuff it's in because if you're
thinking about like a story let's say

4404
01:27:24,310 --> 01:27:24,320
thinking about like a story let's say
 

4405
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,390
thinking about like a story let's say
you're you're listening to a podcast or

4406
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:26,400
you're you're listening to a podcast or
 

4407
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,310
you're you're listening to a podcast or
something you're listening to Lex

4408
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:27,320
something you're listening to Lex
 

4409
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,510
something you're listening to Lex
Freedman podcast right you're putting

4410
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
Freedman podcast right you're putting
 

4411
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,270
Freedman podcast right you're putting
this stuff together and building this

4412
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:31,280
this stuff together and building this
 

4413
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,030
this stuff together and building this
internal model over several seconds

4414
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:34,040
internal model over several seconds
 

4415
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,990
internal model over several seconds
which is basically we filter that out

4416
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,000
which is basically we filter that out
 

4417
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,910
which is basically we filter that out
when we look at electrical activity in

4418
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:37,920
when we look at electrical activity in
 

4419
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,109
when we look at electrical activity in
the brain because we're interested in

4420
01:27:39,109 --> 01:27:39,119
the brain because we're interested in
 

4421
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:41,350
the brain because we're interested in
this millisecond scale it's almost

4422
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,360
this millisecond scale it's almost
 

4423
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,270
this millisecond scale it's almost
massive amounts of information right um

4424
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:44,280
massive amounts of information right um
 

4425
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:46,390
massive amounts of information right um
so the way I see it is every technique

4426
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:46,400
so the way I see it is every technique
 

4427
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,189
so the way I see it is every technique
gives you a little limited window into

4428
01:27:49,189 --> 01:27:49,199
gives you a little limited window into
 

4429
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,470
gives you a little limited window into
what's going on FM is huge problems you

4430
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:51,480
what's going on FM is huge problems you
 

4431
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,709
what's going on FM is huge problems you
know people lie down in the scanner

4432
01:27:53,709 --> 01:27:53,719
know people lie down in the scanner
 

4433
01:27:53,719 --> 01:27:55,350
know people lie down in the scanner
there's parts of the brain where you

4434
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:55,360
there's parts of the brain where you
 

4435
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,109
there's parts of the brain where you
I'll show you in some of these images

4436
01:27:57,109 --> 01:27:57,119
I'll show you in some of these images
 

4437
01:27:57,119 --> 01:27:59,430
I'll show you in some of these images
where you'll see kind of gaping holes

4438
01:27:59,430 --> 01:27:59,440
where you'll see kind of gaping holes
 

4439
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,550
where you'll see kind of gaping holes
because there's you can't keep the

4440
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:01,560
because there's you can't keep the
 

4441
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:04,629
because there's you can't keep the
magnetic field stable in those spots

4442
01:28:04,629 --> 01:28:04,639
magnetic field stable in those spots
 

4443
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:06,270
magnetic field stable in those spots
you'll see Parts where it's like there's

4444
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:06,280
you'll see Parts where it's like there's
 

4445
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,629
you'll see Parts where it's like there's
a vein and so it just produces big

4446
01:28:08,629 --> 01:28:08,639
a vein and so it just produces big
 

4447
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:10,390
a vein and so it just produces big
increases and decreases in Signal or

4448
01:28:10,390 --> 01:28:10,400
increases and decreases in Signal or
 

4449
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,229
increases and decreases in Signal or
respiration that causes these changes

4450
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:12,239
respiration that causes these changes
 

4451
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,149
respiration that causes these changes
there's lots of artifacts and stuff like

4452
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
there's lots of artifacts and stuff like
 

4453
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,550
there's lots of artifacts and stuff like
that you know every technique has its

4454
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:16,560
that you know every technique has its
 

4455
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,790
that you know every technique has its
limits if if I'm lying down an MRI

4456
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
limits if if I'm lying down an MRI
 

4457
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,629
limits if if I'm lying down an MRI
scanner I'm lying down I'm not

4458
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:20,639
scanner I'm lying down I'm not
 

4459
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:23,310
scanner I'm lying down I'm not
interacting with you in the same way

4460
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:23,320
interacting with you in the same way
 

4461
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,669
interacting with you in the same way
that I would in the real world but at

4462
01:28:25,669 --> 01:28:25,679
that I would in the real world but at
 

4463
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,189
that I would in the real world but at
the same time I'm getting data that I

4464
01:28:28,189 --> 01:28:28,199
the same time I'm getting data that I
 

4465
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:30,470
the same time I'm getting data that I
might not be able to get otherwise and

4466
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,480
might not be able to get otherwise and
 

4467
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,109
might not be able to get otherwise and
so different techniques give you

4468
01:28:32,109 --> 01:28:32,119
so different techniques give you
 

4469
01:28:32,119 --> 01:28:33,790
so different techniques give you
different kinds of advantages what kind

4470
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:33,800
different kinds of advantages what kind
 

4471
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,149
different kinds of advantages what kind
of big scientific discoveries maybe the

4472
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:36,159
of big scientific discoveries maybe the
 

4473
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:38,189
of big scientific discoveries maybe the
flavor of discoveries have been

4474
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:38,199
flavor of discoveries have been
 

4475
01:28:38,199 --> 01:28:40,709
flavor of discoveries have been
done throughout the history of the

4476
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:40,719
done throughout the history of the
 

4477
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:43,070
done throughout the history of the
science of memory the studying of memory

4478
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:43,080
science of memory the studying of memory
 

4479
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,870
science of memory the studying of memory
what kind of

4480
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:44,880
what kind of
 

4481
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,669
what kind of
things have been like understood oh

4482
01:28:48,669 --> 01:28:48,679
things have been like understood oh
 

4483
01:28:48,679 --> 01:28:51,830
things have been like understood oh
there's so many it's really so hard to

4484
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:51,840
there's so many it's really so hard to
 

4485
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,669
there's so many it's really so hard to
summarize it I mean I think it's funny

4486
01:28:53,669 --> 01:28:53,679
summarize it I mean I think it's funny
 

4487
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:55,790
summarize it I mean I think it's funny
because it's like when you're in the

4488
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:55,800
because it's like when you're in the
 

4489
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,790
because it's like when you're in the
field you can get kind of Blas about

4490
01:28:57,790 --> 01:28:57,800
field you can get kind of Blas about
 

4491
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,590
field you can get kind of Blas about
this stuff but then once I started write

4492
01:28:59,590 --> 01:28:59,600
this stuff but then once I started write
 

4493
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:01,390
this stuff but then once I started write
the book I was like oh my God this is

4494
01:29:01,390 --> 01:29:01,400
the book I was like oh my God this is
 

4495
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,030
the book I was like oh my God this is
really interesting how did we do all

4496
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,040
really interesting how did we do all
 

4497
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,070
really interesting how did we do all
this stuff

4498
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:06,080
this stuff
 

4499
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,510
this stuff
um um I would say that some of the I

4500
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:09,520
um um I would say that some of the I
 

4501
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,070
um um I would say that some of the I
mean you know from the first studies

4502
01:29:11,070 --> 01:29:11,080
mean you know from the first studies
 

4503
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,950
mean you know from the first studies
just showing how much we forget is very

4504
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:13,960
just showing how much we forget is very
 

4505
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:17,189
just showing how much we forget is very
important showing how much schemas which

4506
01:29:17,189 --> 01:29:17,199
important showing how much schemas which
 

4507
01:29:17,199 --> 01:29:19,590
important showing how much schemas which

01:29:22,709 --> 01:29:22,719
world increase our ability to remember
 

4511
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:25,950
world increase our ability to remember
information just massive ly increase it

4512
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:25,960
information just massive ly increase it
 

4513
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:28,990
information just massive ly increase it
studies of expertise showing how experts

4514
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:29,000
studies of expertise showing how experts
 

4515
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,030
studies of expertise showing how experts
like chess experts can memorize so much

4516
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,040
like chess experts can memorize so much
 

4517
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,390
like chess experts can memorize so much
in such a short amount of time because

4518
01:29:33,390 --> 01:29:33,400
in such a short amount of time because
 

4519
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:36,229
in such a short amount of time because
of the schemas they have for chess um

4520
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
of the schemas they have for chess um
 

4521
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:38,070
of the schemas they have for chess um
but then also showing that those lead to

4522
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,080
but then also showing that those lead to
 

4523
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:40,790
but then also showing that those lead to
all sorts of distortions in memory the

4524
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
all sorts of distortions in memory the
 

4525
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,390
all sorts of distortions in memory the
discovery that the act of remembering

4526
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:43,400
discovery that the act of remembering
 

4527
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,390
discovery that the act of remembering
can change the memory it can strengthen

4528
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:45,400
can change the memory it can strengthen
 

4529
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,270
can change the memory it can strengthen
it but it can also distort it if you get

4530
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:48,280
it but it can also distort it if you get
 

4531
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,669
it but it can also distort it if you get
misinformation at the time and it can

4532
01:29:50,669 --> 01:29:50,679
misinformation at the time and it can
 

4533
01:29:50,679 --> 01:29:53,030
misinformation at the time and it can
also strengthen or weaken other memories

4534
01:29:53,030 --> 01:29:53,040
also strengthen or weaken other memories
 

4535
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,229
also strengthen or weaken other memories
that you didn't even recall all so just

4536
01:29:55,229 --> 01:29:55,239
that you didn't even recall all so just
 

4537
01:29:55,239 --> 01:29:56,470
that you didn't even recall all so just
this whole idea of memory as an

4538
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:56,480
this whole idea of memory as an
 

4539
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:00,189
this whole idea of memory as an
ecosystem I think was a big Discovery um

4540
01:30:00,189 --> 01:30:00,199
ecosystem I think was a big Discovery um
 

4541
01:30:00,199 --> 01:30:03,109
ecosystem I think was a big Discovery um
uh I could go this idea of like breaking

4542
01:30:03,109 --> 01:30:03,119
uh I could go this idea of like breaking
 

4543
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:05,310
uh I could go this idea of like breaking
up our continuous experience into these

4544
01:30:05,310 --> 01:30:05,320
up our continuous experience into these
 

4545
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:08,669
up our continuous experience into these
discret events um I think was a major

4546
01:30:08,669 --> 01:30:08,679
discret events um I think was a major
 

4547
01:30:08,679 --> 01:30:10,470
discret events um I think was a major
Discovery to the discreetness of our

4548
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
Discovery to the discreetness of our
 

4549
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,109
Discovery to the discreetness of our
encoding of Events maybe yeah I mean you

4550
01:30:13,109 --> 01:30:13,119
encoding of Events maybe yeah I mean you
 

4551
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:14,830
encoding of Events maybe yeah I mean you
know and again there's controversial

4552
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:14,840
know and again there's controversial
 

4553
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:16,910
know and again there's controversial
ideas about this right but it's like

4554
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:16,920
ideas about this right but it's like
 

4555
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,109
ideas about this right but it's like
yeah this idea that and this gets back

4556
01:30:19,109 --> 01:30:19,119
yeah this idea that and this gets back
 

4557
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:21,070
yeah this idea that and this gets back
to just this common experience of you

4558
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:21,080
to just this common experience of you
 

4559
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,950
to just this common experience of you
walk into the kitchen and you're like

4560
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:22,960
walk into the kitchen and you're like
 

4561
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,470
walk into the kitchen and you're like
why am I here and you just end up

4562
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:24,480
why am I here and you just end up
 

4563
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,070
why am I here and you just end up
grabbing some food from the fridge and

4564
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:26,080
grabbing some food from the fridge and
 

4565
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,550
grabbing some food from the fridge and
then you go back and you're like oh wait

4566
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:27,560
then you go back and you're like oh wait
 

4567
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,390
then you go back and you're like oh wait
a minute I left my watch in the kitchen

4568
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:29,400
a minute I left my watch in the kitchen
 

4569
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:32,149
a minute I left my watch in the kitchen
that's what I was looking for and so

4570
01:30:32,149 --> 01:30:32,159
that's what I was looking for and so
 

4571
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:33,709
that's what I was looking for and so
what happens is is that you have a

4572
01:30:33,709 --> 01:30:33,719
what happens is is that you have a
 

4573
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:35,709
what happens is is that you have a
little internal model of where you are

4574
01:30:35,709 --> 01:30:35,719
little internal model of where you are
 

4575
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:38,030
little internal model of where you are
what you're thinking about and when you

4576
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:38,040
what you're thinking about and when you
 

4577
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:39,950
what you're thinking about and when you
cross from one room to another those

4578
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:39,960
cross from one room to another those
 

4579
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,070
cross from one room to another those
models get updated and so now when

4580
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:42,080
models get updated and so now when
 

4581
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,510
models get updated and so now when
you're in the kitchen you have to go

4582
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:43,520
you're in the kitchen you have to go
 

4583
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:45,550
you're in the kitchen you have to go
back and mentally time travel back to

4584
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:45,560
back and mentally time travel back to
 

4585
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:48,709
back and mentally time travel back to
this earlier point to remember what what

4586
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:48,719
this earlier point to remember what what
 

4587
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,550
this earlier point to remember what what
it was that you went there for and so

4588
01:30:50,550 --> 01:30:50,560
it was that you went there for and so
 

4589
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:53,350
it was that you went there for and so
these event boundaries turns out like in

4590
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360
these event boundaries turns out like in
 

4591
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,750
these event boundaries turns out like in
our research again I don't want to make

4592
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:54,760
our research again I don't want to make
 

4593
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,070
our research again I don't want to make
it sound like we've figured out

4594
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:56,080
it sound like we've figured out
 

4595
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:57,669
it sound like we've figured out
everything but in our research one of

4596
01:30:57,669 --> 01:30:57,679
everything but in our research one of
 

4597
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:01,790
everything but in our research one of
the things that um we found is is that

4598
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:01,800
the things that um we found is is that
 

4599
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,669
the things that um we found is is that
basically as people get older the

4600
01:31:04,669 --> 01:31:04,679
basically as people get older the
 

4601
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:06,430
basically as people get older the
activity in the hip campus at these

4602
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:06,440
activity in the hip campus at these
 

4603
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:10,470
activity in the hip campus at these
event boundaries tends to go down um and

4604
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:10,480
event boundaries tends to go down um and
 

4605
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,990
event boundaries tends to go down um and
and but independent of age if I give you

4606
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
and but independent of age if I give you
 

4607
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,470
and but independent of age if I give you
outside of the scanner you're done with

4608
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:15,480
outside of the scanner you're done with
 

4609
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,790
outside of the scanner you're done with
the scan I just scan you while you're

4610
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
the scan I just scan you while you're
 

4611
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,070
the scan I just scan you while you're
watching a movie just watch it you come

4612
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:19,080
watching a movie just watch it you come
 

4613
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,390
watching a movie just watch it you come
out I give you a test of memory for

4614
01:31:21,390 --> 01:31:21,400
out I give you a test of memory for
 

4615
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,189
out I give you a test of memory for
stories what happens is you find this

4616
01:31:24,189 --> 01:31:24,199
stories what happens is you find this
 

4617
01:31:24,199 --> 01:31:26,430
stories what happens is you find this
incredible correlation between the

4618
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:26,440
incredible correlation between the
 

4619
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,149
incredible correlation between the
activity and the hippocampus at these

4620
01:31:29,149 --> 01:31:29,159
activity and the hippocampus at these
 

4621
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:31,109
activity and the hippocampus at these
singular points in time these event

4622
01:31:31,109 --> 01:31:31,119
singular points in time these event
 

4623
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:33,430
singular points in time these event
boundaries and your ability to just

4624
01:31:33,430 --> 01:31:33,440
boundaries and your ability to just
 

4625
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:36,109
boundaries and your ability to just
remember a story outside of the scanner

4626
01:31:36,109 --> 01:31:36,119
remember a story outside of the scanner
 

4627
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:38,590
remember a story outside of the scanner
later on so it's marking this ability to

4628
01:31:38,590 --> 01:31:38,600
later on so it's marking this ability to
 

4629
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,149
later on so it's marking this ability to
encode memories just these little

4630
01:31:40,149 --> 01:31:40,159
encode memories just these little
 

4631
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:42,990
encode memories just these little
Snippets of neural activity so I think

4632
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:43,000
Snippets of neural activity so I think
 

4633
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,470
Snippets of neural activity so I think
that's a big one um there's all sorts of

4634
01:31:45,470 --> 01:31:45,480
that's a big one um there's all sorts of
 

4635
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:48,229
that's a big one um there's all sorts of
work in animal models that I can get

4636
01:31:48,229 --> 01:31:48,239
work in animal models that I can get
 

4637
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,790
work in animal models that I can get
into you know sleep I think there's so

4638
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:50,800
into you know sleep I think there's so
 

4639
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:52,629
into you know sleep I think there's so
much interesting stuff that's being

4640
01:31:52,629 --> 01:31:52,639
much interesting stuff that's being
 

4641
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:54,750
much interesting stuff that's being
discovered in sleep right now

4642
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:54,760
discovered in sleep right now
 

4643
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,629
discovered in sleep right now
um being able to just record from large

4644
01:31:58,629 --> 01:31:58,639
um being able to just record from large
 

4645
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,870
um being able to just record from large
populations of cells and then be able to

4646
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:01,880
populations of cells and then be able to
 

4647
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,709
populations of cells and then be able to
relate that one I think the coolest

4648
01:32:03,709 --> 01:32:03,719
relate that one I think the coolest
 

4649
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:05,790
relate that one I think the coolest
thing gets back to this QR code thing

4650
01:32:05,790 --> 01:32:05,800
thing gets back to this QR code thing
 

4651
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:09,310
thing gets back to this QR code thing
because like what we can do now is like

4652
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:09,320
because like what we can do now is like
 

4653
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,550
because like what we can do now is like
I can take fmri data while you're

4654
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:11,560
I can take fmri data while you're
 

4655
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:13,709
I can take fmri data while you're
watching a movie or let's do better than

4656
01:32:13,709 --> 01:32:13,719
watching a movie or let's do better than
 

4657
01:32:13,719 --> 01:32:15,910
watching a movie or let's do better than
that let me get fmri data while you use

4658
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:15,920
that let me get fmri data while you use
 

4659
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,990
that let me get fmri data while you use
a joystick to move around in virtual

4660
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
a joystick to move around in virtual
 

4661
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,629
a joystick to move around in virtual
reality right you're in the metaverse

4662
01:32:19,629 --> 01:32:19,639
reality right you're in the metaverse
 

4663
01:32:19,639 --> 01:32:21,390
reality right you're in the metaverse
whatever right but it's kind of a crappy

4664
01:32:21,390 --> 01:32:21,400
whatever right but it's kind of a crappy
 

4665
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,709
whatever right but it's kind of a crappy
metaverse because there's always so much

4666
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:22,719
metaverse because there's always so much
 

4667
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:25,750
metaverse because there's always so much
metav versing you can do M so they doing

4668
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:25,760
metav versing you can do M so they doing
 

4669
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,550
metav versing you can do M so they doing
this crappy metsing so now I can take a

4670
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:29,560
this crappy metsing so now I can take a
 

4671
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,070
this crappy metsing so now I can take a
rat record from his hippocampus and

4672
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:32,080
rat record from his hippocampus and
 

4673
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,149
rat record from his hippocampus and
prefrontal cortex and all these areas

4674
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:34,159
prefrontal cortex and all these areas
 

4675
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:35,910
prefrontal cortex and all these areas
with these really new electrodes get

4676
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:35,920
with these really new electrodes get
 

4677
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,830
with these really new electrodes get
massive amounts of data and have it move

4678
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:38,840
massive amounts of data and have it move
 

4679
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,430
massive amounts of data and have it move
around on a track ball in virtual

4680
01:32:41,430 --> 01:32:41,440
around on a track ball in virtual
 

4681
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,270
around on a track ball in virtual
reality in the same metaverse that I did

4682
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:44,280
reality in the same metaverse that I did
 

4683
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,950
reality in the same metaverse that I did
and record that rats activity I can get

4684
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:46,960
and record that rats activity I can get
 

4685
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:49,149
and record that rats activity I can get
a person with epilepsy who we have

4686
01:32:49,149 --> 01:32:49,159
a person with epilepsy who we have
 

4687
01:32:49,159 --> 01:32:50,990
a person with epilepsy who we have
electrodes in the brain anyway to try to

4688
01:32:50,990 --> 01:32:51,000
electrodes in the brain anyway to try to
 

4689
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,629
electrodes in the brain anyway to try to
figure out where the seizures are coming

4690
01:32:52,629 --> 01:32:52,639
figure out where the seizures are coming
 

4691
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:54,510
figure out where the seizures are coming
from if it's a healthy part of the brain

4692
01:32:54,510 --> 01:32:54,520
from if it's a healthy part of the brain
 

4693
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:57,629
from if it's a healthy part of the brain
record from that person right and I can

4694
01:32:57,629 --> 01:32:57,639
record from that person right and I can
 

4695
01:32:57,639 --> 01:33:01,070
record from that person right and I can
get a computational model uh in one of

4696
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:01,080
get a computational model uh in one of
 

4697
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,149
get a computational model uh in one of
the one of the brand new members in my

01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:04,990
the one of the brand new members in my
lab Tyler bond is just doing some great

4700
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:05,000
lab Tyler bond is just doing some great
 

4701
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,910
lab Tyler bond is just doing some great
stuff he he relates computer vision

4702
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:07,920
stuff he he relates computer vision
 

4703
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,510
stuff he he relates computer vision
models and looks at the weaknesses of

4704
01:33:09,510 --> 01:33:09,520
models and looks at the weaknesses of
 

4705
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,310
models and looks at the weaknesses of
computer vision models and relates it to

4706
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:11,320
computer vision models and relates it to
 

4707
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:15,030
computer vision models and relates it to
what the brain does well um and so you

4708
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:15,040
what the brain does well um and so you
 

4709
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:18,149
what the brain does well um and so you
can actually take a a ground truth you

4710
01:33:18,149 --> 01:33:18,159
can actually take a a ground truth you
 

4711
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:21,510
can actually take a a ground truth you
know um uh code for the metaverse

4712
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:21,520
know um uh code for the metaverse
 

4713
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,510
know um uh code for the metaverse
basically and you can feed in the visual

4714
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:24,520
basically and you can feed in the visual
 

4715
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:25,950
basically and you can feed in the visual
information let's say the sensory

4716
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:25,960
information let's say the sensory
 

4717
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,189
information let's say the sensory
information or whatever that's coming in

4718
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:28,199
information or whatever that's coming in
 

4719
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:31,109
information or whatever that's coming in
to a computational model that's designed

4720
01:33:31,109 --> 01:33:31,119
to a computational model that's designed
 

4721
01:33:31,119 --> 01:33:34,550
to a computational model that's designed
to take real world inputs right and you

4722
01:33:34,550 --> 01:33:34,560
to take real world inputs right and you
 

4723
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,470
to take real world inputs right and you
could basically tie them all together by

4724
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:37,480
could basically tie them all together by
 

4725
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:39,470
could basically tie them all together by
virtue of the state spaces that you're

4726
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:39,480
virtue of the state spaces that you're
 

4727
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,189
virtue of the state spaces that you're
measuring in neural activity in these

4728
01:33:42,189 --> 01:33:42,199
measuring in neural activity in these
 

4729
01:33:42,199 --> 01:33:43,669
measuring in neural activity in these
different formats these different

4730
01:33:43,669 --> 01:33:43,679
different formats these different
 

4731
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:46,070
different formats these different
species and in the computational model

4732
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:46,080
species and in the computational model
 

4733
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,870
species and in the computational model
which is just I just find that

4734
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:47,880
which is just I just find that
 

4735
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:50,350
which is just I just find that
mindblowing you could do uh different

4736
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:50,360
mindblowing you could do uh different
 

4737
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,470
mindblowing you could do uh different
kinds of analyses on language and

4738
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,480
kinds of analyses on language and
 

4739
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:54,270
kinds of analyses on language and
basically come up with just like the

4740
01:33:54,270 --> 01:33:54,280
basically come up with just like the
 

4741
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,870
basically come up with just like the
basically it's the guts of llms right

4742
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:56,880
basically it's the guts of llms right
 

4743
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,189
basically it's the guts of llms right
you have you could do um analyses on

4744
01:34:00,189 --> 01:34:00,199
you have you could do um analyses on
 

4745
01:34:00,199 --> 01:34:02,830
you have you could do um analyses on
language and you could do analysis on

4746
01:34:02,830 --> 01:34:02,840
language and you could do analysis on
 

4747
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,189
language and you could do analysis on
you know sentiment analyses of emotions

4748
01:34:05,189 --> 01:34:05,199
you know sentiment analyses of emotions
 

4749
01:34:05,199 --> 01:34:07,910
you know sentiment analyses of emotions
and so forth put all this stuff together

4750
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:07,920
and so forth put all this stuff together
 

4751
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,270
and so forth put all this stuff together
I mean it's it's almost too much but if

4752
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
I mean it's it's almost too much but if
 

4753
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:12,910
I mean it's it's almost too much but if
you do it right and you do it in a

4754
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:12,920
you do it right and you do it in a
 

4755
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:15,310
you do it right and you do it in a
theory driven way as opposed to just

4756
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:15,320
theory driven way as opposed to just
 

4757
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,750
theory driven way as opposed to just
throwing all the data at the wall and

4758
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:16,760
throwing all the data at the wall and
 

4759
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,149
throwing all the data at the wall and
see what sticks I mean that to me is

4760
01:34:19,149 --> 01:34:19,159
see what sticks I mean that to me is
 

4761
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:21,109
see what sticks I mean that to me is
just exceptionally powerful so you can

4762
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:21,119
just exceptionally powerful so you can
 

4763
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:25,310
just exceptionally powerful so you can
take fmri data in across species and

4764
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:25,320
take fmri data in across species and
 

4765
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,550
take fmri data in across species and
across different types of humans or

4766
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:27,560
across different types of humans or
 

4767
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,189
across different types of humans or
conditions of humans and what

4768
01:34:30,189 --> 01:34:30,199
conditions of humans and what
 

4769
01:34:30,199 --> 01:34:32,950
conditions of humans and what
find construct

4770
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:32,960
find construct
 

4771
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,109
find construct
models that help you find the

4772
01:34:35,109 --> 01:34:35,119
models that help you find the
 

4773
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:37,669
models that help you find the
commonalities or like the the core thing

4774
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
commonalities or like the the core thing
 

4775
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:39,950
commonalities or like the the core thing
that makes somebody navigate through the

4776
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:39,960
that makes somebody navigate through the
 

4777
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:42,149
that makes somebody navigate through the
metaverse for example yeah yeah I mean

4778
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:42,159
metaverse for example yeah yeah I mean
 

4779
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:43,870
metaverse for example yeah yeah I mean
more or less I mean there's a lot of

4780
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:43,880
more or less I mean there's a lot of
 

4781
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,950
more or less I mean there's a lot of
details but yes I think and not just

4782
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:45,960
details but yes I think and not just
 

4783
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:48,550
details but yes I think and not just
fmri but you can relate it to like I

4784
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:48,560
fmri but you can relate it to like I
 

4785
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,910
fmri but you can relate it to like I
said recordings from large populations

4786
01:34:50,910 --> 01:34:50,920
said recordings from large populations
 

4787
01:34:50,920 --> 01:34:52,910
said recordings from large populations
of neurons that could be taken any human

4788
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:52,920
of neurons that could be taken any human
 

4789
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,629
of neurons that could be taken any human
or even in a non-human animal that is

4790
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
or even in a non-human animal that is
 

4791
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,510
or even in a non-human animal that is
you know where you think it's an

4792
01:34:58,510 --> 01:34:58,520
you know where you think it's an
 

4793
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,669
you know where you think it's an
anatomical homologue so that's just

4794
01:35:01,669 --> 01:35:01,679
anatomical homologue so that's just
 

4795
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:03,910
anatomical homologue so that's just
mind-blowing to me what's the uh

4796
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
mind-blowing to me what's the uh
 

4797
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,109
mind-blowing to me what's the uh
similarities in humans and

4798
01:35:07,109 --> 01:35:07,119
similarities in humans and
 

4799
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:10,750
similarities in humans and
mice I what Smashing Pumpkins uh we all

4800
01:35:10,750 --> 01:35:10,760
mice I what Smashing Pumpkins uh we all
 

4801
01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:12,830

just rats in a cage is that Smashing

4802
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:12,840
just rats in a cage is that Smashing
 

4803
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:15,669
just rats in a cage is that Smashing
Pumpkins despite all of your rage is

4804
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:15,679

4805
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:17,669
Pumpkins despite all of your rage is
that Smashing Pumpkins I think despite

4806
01:35:17,669 --> 01:35:17,679
that Smashing Pumpkins I think despite
 

4807
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,790
that Smashing Pumpkins I think despite
all of your rage at gifs you're still

4808
01:35:19,790 --> 01:35:19,800
all of your rage at gifs you're still
 

4809

lasting memory of this conversation and

4818
01:35:31,590 --> 01:35:31,600
lasting memory of this conversation and
 

4819
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,990
lasting memory of this conversation and
it's strengthening the P the visual

4820
01:35:33,990 --> 01:35:34,000
it's strengthening the P the visual
 

4821
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,830
it's strengthening the P the visual
thing I have of you with James Brown on

4822
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:35,840
thing I have of you with James Brown on
 

4823
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,990
thing I have of you with James Brown on
stage it's just com stronger and

4824
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:38,000
stage it's just com stronger and
 

4825
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:43,030
stage it's just com stronger and
stronger by the second um hot up but

4826
01:35:43,030 --> 01:35:43,040
stronger by the second um hot up but
 

4827
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,430
stronger by the second um hot up but
animal studies work here as well yeah

4828
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:45,440
animal studies work here as well yeah
 

4829
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,590
animal studies work here as well yeah
yeah so okay so let's go to the um so I

4830
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:48,600
yeah so okay so let's go to the um so I
 

4831
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,790
yeah so okay so let's go to the um so I
think re I've got you know great

4832
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:50,800
think re I've got you know great
 

4833
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,669
think re I've got you know great
colleagues who I talk to who study

4834
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
colleagues who I talk to who study
 

4835
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,189
colleagues who I talk to who study
memory in mice you know and there's some

4836
01:35:56,189 --> 01:35:56,199
memory in mice you know and there's some
 

4837
01:35:56,199 --> 01:35:58,750
memory in mice you know and there's some
uh um one of the valuable things in

4838
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:58,760
uh um one of the valuable things in
 

4839
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:01,189
uh um one of the valuable things in
those models is you can study neural

4840
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:01,199
those models is you can study neural
 

4841
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:03,430
those models is you can study neural
circuits in an enormously targeted way

4842
01:36:03,430 --> 01:36:03,440
circuits in an enormously targeted way
 

4843
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,310
circuits in an enormously targeted way
because you could do these genetic

4844
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:05,320
because you could do these genetic
 

4845
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,709
because you could do these genetic
studies for instance where you can

4846
01:36:06,709 --> 01:36:06,719
studies for instance where you can
 

4847
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,830
studies for instance where you can
manipulate like particular groups of

4848
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
manipulate like particular groups of
 

4849
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,709
manipulate like particular groups of
neurons and it's just getting more and

4850
01:36:11,709 --> 01:36:11,719
neurons and it's just getting more and
 

4851
01:36:11,719 --> 01:36:13,430
neurons and it's just getting more and
more targeted to the point where you can

4852
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:13,440
more targeted to the point where you can
 

4853
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:17,229
more targeted to the point where you can
actually turn on uh particular kind of

4854
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:17,239
actually turn on uh particular kind of
 

4855
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:19,950
actually turn on uh particular kind of
memory just by activating a particular

4856
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:19,960
memory just by activating a particular
 

4857
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,910
memory just by activating a particular
set of neurons that was active during an

4858
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:21,920
set of neurons that was active during an
 

4859
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,109
set of neurons that was active during an
experience right so

4860
01:36:24,109 --> 01:36:24,119
experience right so
 

4861
01:36:24,119 --> 01:36:27,470
experience right so
so there's a lot of conservation of some

4862
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:27,480
so there's a lot of conservation of some
 

4863
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:30,270
so there's a lot of conservation of some
of these neural circuits across you know

4864
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:30,280
of these neural circuits across you know
 

4865
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:33,669
of these neural circuits across you know
um evolution in mammals for instance um

4866
01:36:33,669 --> 01:36:33,679
um evolution in mammals for instance um
 

4867
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:35,350
um evolution in mammals for instance um
and then some people would even say that

4868
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:35,360
and then some people would even say that
 

4869
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,070
and then some people would even say that
there's genetic mechanisms for learning

4870
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:37,080
there's genetic mechanisms for learning
 

4871
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,070
there's genetic mechanisms for learning
that are conserved even going back far

4872
01:36:39,070 --> 01:36:39,080
that are conserved even going back far
 

4873
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,430
that are conserved even going back far
far before but let's go back to the mice

4874
01:36:42,430 --> 01:36:42,440
far before but let's go back to the mice
 

4875
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,030
far before but let's go back to the mice
in humans question right um there's a

4876
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,040
in humans question right um there's a
 

4877
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,910
in humans question right um there's a
lot of differences so for one thing the

4878
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:46,920
lot of differences so for one thing the
 

4879
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:50,149
lot of differences so for one thing the
sensory information is very different uh

4880
01:36:50,149 --> 01:36:50,159
sensory information is very different uh
 

4881
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:53,109
sensory information is very different uh
mice and rats explore the world largely

4882
01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
mice and rats explore the world largely
 

4883
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,070
mice and rats explore the world largely
through

4884
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:54,080
through
 

4885
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:57,030
through
um smelling all faction uh but they also

4886
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:57,040
um smelling all faction uh but they also
 

4887
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,629
um smelling all faction uh but they also
have Vision that's kind of designed to

4888
01:36:58,629 --> 01:36:58,639
have Vision that's kind of designed to
 

4889
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:00,550
have Vision that's kind of designed to
kind of catch Death from Above So it's

4890
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:00,560
kind of catch Death from Above So it's
 

4891
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,470
kind of catch Death from Above So it's
like a very big view of the world and we

4892
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:03,480
like a very big view of the world and we
 

4893
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:05,790
like a very big view of the world and we
move our eyes around in a way that

4894
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:05,800
move our eyes around in a way that
 

4895
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:08,270
move our eyes around in a way that
focuses on particular spots and space

4896
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:08,280
focuses on particular spots and space
 

4897
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,390
focuses on particular spots and space
where you get very high resolution from

4898
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:10,400
where you get very high resolution from
 

4899
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,669
where you get very high resolution from
a very limited set of spots in space so

4900
01:37:12,669 --> 01:37:12,679
a very limited set of spots in space so
 

4901
01:37:12,679 --> 01:37:15,830
a very limited set of spots in space so
that makes us very different in that way

4902
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:15,840
that makes us very different in that way
 

4903
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:17,550
that makes us very different in that way
we also have all these other structures

4904
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:17,560
we also have all these other structures
 

4905
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:21,590
we also have all these other structures
as social animals that allow us to um

4906
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
as social animals that allow us to um
 

4907
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,790
as social animals that allow us to um
respond differently there's language

4908
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:23,800
respond differently there's language
 

4909
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:26,149
respond differently there's language
there's like um you know so you name it

4910
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:26,159
there's like um you know so you name it
 

4911
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:27,990
there's like um you know so you name it
there's obviously gobs of differences

4912
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:28,000
there's obviously gobs of differences
 

4913
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,750
there's obviously gobs of differences
humans aren't just giant rats there's

4914
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:29,760
humans aren't just giant rats there's
 

4915
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,550
humans aren't just giant rats there's
much more complexity to us time scales

4916
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:31,560
much more complexity to us time scales
 

4917
01:37:31,560 --> 01:37:35,270
much more complexity to us time scales
are very important so primate brains and

4918
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:35,280
are very important so primate brains and
 

4919
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,669
are very important so primate brains and
human brains are especially good at

4920
01:37:37,669 --> 01:37:37,679
human brains are especially good at
 

4921
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,550
human brains are especially good at
integrating and um and holding on to

4922
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:40,560
integrating and um and holding on to
 

4923
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,430
integrating and um and holding on to
information across longer and longer

4924
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:42,440
information across longer and longer
 

4925
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,669
information across longer and longer
periods of time right and and also you

4926
01:37:45,669 --> 01:37:45,679
periods of time right and and also you
 

4927
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:47,070
periods of time right and and also you
know finally it's like our history of

4928
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:47,080
know finally it's like our history of
 

4929
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,990
know finally it's like our history of
training data so to speak is very very

4930
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,000
training data so to speak is very very
 

4931
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,709
training data so to speak is very very
different than you know I mean human's

4932
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:52,719
different than you know I mean human's
 

4933
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,470
different than you know I mean human's
world is very different than a wild M

4934
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:55,480
world is very different than a wild M
 

4935
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:58,189
world is very different than a wild M
Mouse's world and a lab Mouse's world is

4936
01:37:58,189 --> 01:37:58,199
Mouse's world and a lab Mouse's world is
 

4937
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:00,229
Mouse's world and a lab Mouse's world is
extraordinarily impoverished relative to

4938
01:38:00,229 --> 01:38:00,239
extraordinarily impoverished relative to
 

4939
01:38:00,239 --> 01:38:02,350
extraordinarily impoverished relative to
an adult human you know but still what

4940
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:02,360
an adult human you know but still what
 

4941
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,070
an adult human you know but still what
can you understand by studying mice I

4942
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:04,080
can you understand by studying mice I
 

4943
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:06,470
can you understand by studying mice I
mean just basic almost behavioral stuff

4944
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:06,480
mean just basic almost behavioral stuff
 

4945
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:09,229
mean just basic almost behavioral stuff
about memory well yes but that's very

4946
01:38:09,229 --> 01:38:09,239
about memory well yes but that's very
 

4947
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:11,990
about memory well yes but that's very
important right so you can understand

4948
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,000
important right so you can understand
 

4949
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,950
important right so you can understand
for instance how do neurons talk to each

4950
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:13,960
for instance how do neurons talk to each
 

4951
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:17,550
for instance how do neurons talk to each
other that's a really big big question

4952
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:17,560
other that's a really big big question
 

4953
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,870
other that's a really big big question
neural computation in and of itself you

4954
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:19,880
neural computation in and of itself you
 

4955
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:21,629
neural computation in and of itself you
think it's the most simple question

4956
01:38:21,629 --> 01:38:21,639
think it's the most simple question
 

4957
01:38:21,639 --> 01:38:24,310
think it's the most simple question
right not at all I mean it's a big big

4958
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:24,320
right not at all I mean it's a big big
 

4959
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:28,270
right not at all I mean it's a big big
question and understanding how two parts

4960
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:28,280
question and understanding how two parts
 

4961
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,870
question and understanding how two parts
of the brain interact meaning that it's

4962
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:30,880
of the brain interact meaning that it's
 

4963
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,669
of the brain interact meaning that it's
not just one area speaking it's not like

4964
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:33,679
not just one area speaking it's not like
 

4965
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:35,669
not just one area speaking it's not like
you know it's not like Twitter where one

4966
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
you know it's not like Twitter where one
 

4967
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,109
you know it's not like Twitter where one
area of the brain is shouting and then

4968
01:38:37,109 --> 01:38:37,119
area of the brain is shouting and then
 

4969
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:38,830
area of the brain is shouting and then
another area of the brain's just stuck

4970
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:38,840
another area of the brain's just stuck
 

4971
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:40,709
another area of the brain's just stuck
listening to this scrap it's like

4972
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:40,719
listening to this scrap it's like
 

4973
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,390
listening to this scrap it's like
they're actually interacting on a

4974
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:42,400
they're actually interacting on a
 

4975
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:44,550
they're actually interacting on a
millisecond scale right how does that

4976
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:44,560
millisecond scale right how does that
 

4977
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,830
millisecond scale right how does that
happen and how do you regulate those

4978
01:38:46,830 --> 01:38:46,840
happen and how do you regulate those
 

4979
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,750
happen and how do you regulate those
interactions these Dynamic you know um

4980
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:49,760
interactions these Dynamic you know um
 

4981
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,510
interactions these Dynamic you know um
interactions we're still figuring that

4982
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:51,520
interactions we're still figuring that
 

4983
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,669
interactions we're still figuring that
out but that's going to be coming large

4984
01:38:53,669 --> 01:38:53,679
out but that's going to be coming large
 

4985
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:56,470
out but that's going to be coming large
from model systems that are easier to

4986
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:56,480
from model systems that are easier to
 

4987
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,109
from model systems that are easier to
understand um you can do manipulations

4988
01:38:59,109 --> 01:38:59,119
understand um you can do manipulations
 

4989
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:01,589
understand um you can do manipulations
like drug manipulations to manipulate

4990
01:39:01,589 --> 01:39:01,599
like drug manipulations to manipulate
 

4991
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:04,149
like drug manipulations to manipulate
circuits and and you know use viruses

4992
01:39:04,149 --> 01:39:04,159
circuits and and you know use viruses
 

4993
01:39:04,159 --> 01:39:06,109
circuits and and you know use viruses
and so forth and lasers to turn on

4994
01:39:06,109 --> 01:39:06,119
and so forth and lasers to turn on
 

4995
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:07,990
and so forth and lasers to turn on
circuits that you just can't do in

4996
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:08,000
circuits that you just can't do in
 

4997
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,750
circuits that you just can't do in
humans so I think there's a lot that can

4998
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:10,760
humans so I think there's a lot that can
 

4999
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:12,510
humans so I think there's a lot that can
be learned from mice there's a lot that

5000
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:12,520
be learned from mice there's a lot that
 

5001
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,709
be learned from mice there's a lot that
can be learned from non-human primates

5002
01:39:14,709 --> 01:39:14,719
can be learned from non-human primates
 

5003
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,430
can be learned from non-human primates
and there's a lot that you need to learn

5004
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:16,440
and there's a lot that you need to learn
 

5005
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,430
and there's a lot that you need to learn
from humans and I think um unfortunately

5006
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:19,440
from humans and I think um unfortunately
 

5007
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:21,709
from humans and I think um unfortunately
some of the uh people in the National

5008
01:39:21,709 --> 01:39:21,719
some of the uh people in the National
 

5009
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:23,109
some of the uh people in the National
Institutes of Health think you can learn

5010
01:39:23,109 --> 01:39:23,119
Institutes of Health think you can learn
 

5011
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:25,390
Institutes of Health think you can learn
everything from the mouse it's a like

5012
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:25,400
everything from the mouse it's a like
 

5013
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:27,070
everything from the mouse it's a like
why study memory in humans what I could

5014
01:39:27,070 --> 01:39:27,080
why study memory in humans what I could
 

5015
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:29,030
why study memory in humans what I could
study learning in a mouse and it's just

5016
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,040
study learning in a mouse and it's just
 

5017
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,470
study learning in a mouse and it's just
like oh my God I'm going to get my

5018
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
like oh my God I'm going to get my
 

5019
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:34,189
like oh my God I'm going to get my
funding from somewhere else so uh well

5020
01:39:34,189 --> 01:39:34,199
funding from somewhere else so uh well
 

5021
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:35,910
funding from somewhere else so uh well
let me ask you some random fascinating

5022
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
let me ask you some random fascinating
 

5023
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:41,589
let me ask you some random fascinating
questions uh uh how does deja vu work so

5024
01:39:41,589 --> 01:39:41,599
questions uh uh how does deja vu work so
 

5025
01:39:41,599 --> 01:39:45,229
questions uh uh how does deja vu work so
Deja Vu is it's actually one of these

5026
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:45,239
Deja Vu is it's actually one of these
 

5027
01:39:45,239 --> 01:39:47,629
Deja Vu is it's actually one of these
things I think that some of the surveys

5028
01:39:47,629 --> 01:39:47,639
things I think that some of the surveys
 

5029
01:39:47,639 --> 01:39:50,550
things I think that some of the surveys
suggest that like 75% of people report

5030
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:50,560
suggest that like 75% of people report
 

5031
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,510
suggest that like 75% of people report
having a Deja Vu experience one time or

5032
01:39:52,510 --> 01:39:52,520
having a Deja Vu experience one time or
 

5033
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:54,270
having a Deja Vu experience one time or
another I don't know where that came

5034
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:54,280
another I don't know where that came
 

5035
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,750
another I don't know where that came
from but I've pulled people in my class

5036
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:56,760
from but I've pulled people in my class
 

5037
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,550
from but I've pulled people in my class
and most of them say they've experienced

5038
01:39:58,550 --> 01:39:58,560
and most of them say they've experienced
 

5039
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,709
and most of them say they've experienced
Aja Vu um it's this kind of sense that

5040
01:40:01,709 --> 01:40:01,719
Aja Vu um it's this kind of sense that
 

5041
01:40:01,719 --> 01:40:03,910
Aja Vu um it's this kind of sense that
I've experienced this moment sometime

5042
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:03,920
I've experienced this moment sometime
 

5043
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:06,790
I've experienced this moment sometime
before I've been here before um and

5044
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:06,800
before I've been here before um and
 

5045
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,229
before I've been here before um and
actually there's all sorts of variants

5046
01:40:08,229 --> 01:40:08,239
actually there's all sorts of variants
 

5047
01:40:08,239 --> 01:40:09,669
actually there's all sorts of variants
of this the French have all sorts of

5048
01:40:09,669 --> 01:40:09,679
of this the French have all sorts of
 

5049
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:11,990
of this the French have all sorts of
names for various versions of the Shamy

5050
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:12,000
names for various versions of the Shamy
 

5051
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,750
names for various versions of the Shamy
Vu Harley Vu I don't know whatever it's

5052
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:14,760
Vu Harley Vu I don't know whatever it's
 

5053
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:18,790
Vu Harley Vu I don't know whatever it's
like all these different V yeah but um

5054
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:18,800
like all these different V yeah but um
 

5055
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,589
like all these different V yeah but um
uh Deja Vu is the sense that it can be

5056
01:40:21,589 --> 01:40:21,599
uh Deja Vu is the sense that it can be
 

5057
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:24,030
uh Deja Vu is the sense that it can be
like uh almost disturbing intense sense

5058
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,040
like uh almost disturbing intense sense
 

5059
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:24,910
like uh almost disturbing intense sense
of

5060
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:24,920
of
 

5061
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:27,750
of
familiarity um so there was a a

5062
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:27,760
familiarity um so there was a a
 

5063
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:29,830
familiarity um so there was a a
researcher named Wilder Penfield

5064
01:40:29,830 --> 01:40:29,840
researcher named Wilder Penfield
 

5065
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,510
researcher named Wilder Penfield
actually this goes back even earlier to

5066
01:40:31,510 --> 01:40:31,520
actually this goes back even earlier to
 

5067
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:34,189
actually this goes back even earlier to
some of the earliest like hings Jackson

5068
01:40:34,189 --> 01:40:34,199
some of the earliest like hings Jackson
 

5069
01:40:34,199 --> 01:40:36,470
some of the earliest like hings Jackson
was this neurologist who first charact

5070
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,480
was this neurologist who first charact
 

5071
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,470
was this neurologist who first charact
who did a lot of the early

5072
01:40:37,470 --> 01:40:37,480
who did a lot of the early
 

5073
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:39,709
who did a lot of the early
characterizations of epilepsy and one of

5074
01:40:39,709 --> 01:40:39,719
characterizations of epilepsy and one of
 

5075
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:41,629
characterizations of epilepsy and one of
the things you notice is in epilepsy

5076
01:40:41,629 --> 01:40:41,639
the things you notice is in epilepsy
 

5077
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:44,270
the things you notice is in epilepsy
patients some group of them right before

5078
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:44,280
patients some group of them right before
 

5079
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,390
patients some group of them right before
they would get a seizure they would have

5080
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:46,400
they would get a seizure they would have
 

5081
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:49,669
they would get a seizure they would have
this intense sense of deja vu so it's

5082
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:49,679
this intense sense of deja vu so it's
 

5083
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,830
this intense sense of deja vu so it's
this artificial sense of familiarity

5084
01:40:52,830 --> 01:40:52,840
this artificial sense of familiarity
 

5085
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:55,669
this artificial sense of familiarity
it's a sense of having a memory that's

5086
01:40:55,669 --> 01:40:55,679
it's a sense of having a memory that's
 

5087
01:40:55,679 --> 01:40:58,910
it's a sense of having a memory that's
not there right and so what was

5088
01:40:58,910 --> 01:40:58,920
not there right and so what was
 

5089
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,629
not there right and so what was
happening was there was electrical

5090
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:00,639
happening was there was electrical
 

5091
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:01,790
happening was there was electrical
activity in certain parts of these

5092
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:01,800
activity in certain parts of these
 

5093
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:04,270
activity in certain parts of these
brains say so this guy Penfield later on

5094
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:04,280
brains say so this guy Penfield later on
 

5095
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:07,550
brains say so this guy Penfield later on
when he was trying to look for how do we

5096
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:07,560
when he was trying to look for how do we
 

5097
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,950
when he was trying to look for how do we
map out the brain to figure out which

5098
01:41:09,950 --> 01:41:09,960
map out the brain to figure out which
 

5099
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,589
map out the brain to figure out which
parts we want to remove and which parts

5100
01:41:11,589 --> 01:41:11,599
parts we want to remove and which parts
 

5101
01:41:11,599 --> 01:41:13,830
parts we want to remove and which parts
don't we he would stimulate parts of the

5102
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:13,840
don't we he would stimulate parts of the
 

5103
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,750
don't we he would stimulate parts of the
temporal loes of the brain and find you

5104
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:15,760
temporal loes of the brain and find you
 

5105
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,070
temporal loes of the brain and find you
could elicit the sense of deu sometimes

5106
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:18,080
could elicit the sense of deu sometimes
 

5107
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,910
could elicit the sense of deu sometimes
you'd actually get a memory that a

5108
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:19,920
you'd actually get a memory that a
 

5109
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,750
you'd actually get a memory that a
person would re-experience just from

5110
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:21,760
person would re-experience just from
 

5111
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,149
person would re-experience just from
electrically stimulating some part

5112
01:41:24,149 --> 01:41:24,159
electrically stimulating some part
 

5113
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:25,709
electrically stimulating some part
sometimes they just have this intense

5114
01:41:25,709 --> 01:41:25,719
sometimes they just have this intense
 

5115
01:41:25,719 --> 01:41:29,109
sometimes they just have this intense
feeling of being somewhere before and so

5116
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:29,119
feeling of being somewhere before and so
 

5117
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:32,510
feeling of being somewhere before and so
um one Theory which I really like is is

5118
01:41:32,510 --> 01:41:32,520
um one Theory which I really like is is
 

5119
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:35,070
um one Theory which I really like is is
that in higher order areas of the brain

5120
01:41:35,070 --> 01:41:35,080
that in higher order areas of the brain
 

5121
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,910
that in higher order areas of the brain
they're integrating from many many

5122
01:41:36,910 --> 01:41:36,920
they're integrating from many many
 

5123
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:40,030
they're integrating from many many
different you know sources of input what

5124
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:40,040
different you know sources of input what
 

5125
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:42,589
different you know sources of input what
happens is is that they're tuning

5126
01:41:42,589 --> 01:41:42,599
happens is is that they're tuning
 

5127
01:41:42,599 --> 01:41:45,390
happens is is that they're tuning
themselves up every time you process a

5128
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:45,400
themselves up every time you process a
 

5129
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:49,229
themselves up every time you process a
similar input right and so that allows

5130
01:41:49,229 --> 01:41:49,239
similar input right and so that allows
 

5131
01:41:49,239 --> 01:41:51,390
similar input right and so that allows
you to just get this kind of a fluent

5132
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:51,400
you to just get this kind of a fluent
 

5133
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,830
you to just get this kind of a fluent
sense that I'm very familiar you're very

5134
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:53,840
sense that I'm very familiar you're very
 

5135
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:55,669
sense that I'm very familiar you're very
familiar with this place right and so

5136
01:41:55,669 --> 01:41:55,679
familiar with this place right and so
 

5137
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,990
familiar with this place right and so
just being here you're not going to be

5138
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:58,000
just being here you're not going to be
 

5139
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,790
just being here you're not going to be
moving your eyes all over the place CU

5140
01:41:59,790 --> 01:41:59,800
moving your eyes all over the place CU
 

5141
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:00,950
moving your eyes all over the place CU
you kind of have an idea of where

5142
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:00,960
you kind of have an idea of where
 

5143
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,270
you kind of have an idea of where
everything is and that fluency gives you

5144
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:03,280
everything is and that fluency gives you
 

5145
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,189
everything is and that fluency gives you
a sense of like I'm here now I wake up

5146
01:42:05,189 --> 01:42:05,199
a sense of like I'm here now I wake up
 

5147
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:07,990
a sense of like I'm here now I wake up
in my hotel room and I have this very

5148
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:08,000
in my hotel room and I have this very
 

5149
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,990
in my hotel room and I have this very
unfamiliar sense of where I am right but

5150
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:11,000
unfamiliar sense of where I am right but
 

5151
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,629
unfamiliar sense of where I am right but
you know there's a great set of studies

5152
01:42:12,629 --> 01:42:12,639
you know there's a great set of studies
 

5153

where she created these virtual reality

5156
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,040
where she created these virtual reality
 

5157
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:18,750
where she created these virtual reality
environments and we'll go back to the

5158
01:42:18,750 --> 01:42:18,760
environments and we'll go back to the
 

5159
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:21,070
environments and we'll go back to the
metaverse imagine you go through a

5160
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:21,080
metaverse imagine you go through a
 

5161
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,750
metaverse imagine you go through a
virtual Museum right

5162
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:23,760
virtual Museum right
 

5163
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:25,350
virtual Museum right
and then she would put people in virtual

5164
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:25,360
and then she would put people in virtual
 

5165
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,430
and then she would put people in virtual
reality and have them go through a

5166
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:27,440
reality and have them go through a
 

5167
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:30,629
reality and have them go through a
virtual arcade but the map of the two

5168
01:42:30,629 --> 01:42:30,639
virtual arcade but the map of the two
 

5169
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:32,510
virtual arcade but the map of the two
places was exactly the same she just

5170
01:42:32,510 --> 01:42:32,520
places was exactly the same she just
 

5171
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,430
places was exactly the same she just

puts different skins on them so one
 

5173
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:35,709
puts different skins on them so one
looks different than the other but

5174
01:42:35,709 --> 01:42:35,719
looks different than the other but
 

5175
01:42:35,719 --> 01:42:37,750
looks different than the other but
they've got same landmarks and the same

5176
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:37,760
they've got same landmarks and the same
 

5177
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:39,990
they've got same landmarks and the same

conscious idea that the two were the

5184
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:47,560
conscious idea that the two were the
 

5185
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,990
conscious idea that the two were the
same but they could report this very

5186
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:50,000
same but they could report this very
 

5187
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,669
same but they could report this very
intense sense of deja vu so it's like a

5188
01:42:52,669 --> 01:42:52,679
intense sense of deja vu so it's like a
 

5189
01:42:52,679 --> 01:42:54,830
intense sense of deja vu so it's like a
partial match that's eliciting this kind

5190
01:42:54,830 --> 01:42:54,840
partial match that's eliciting this kind
 

5191
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:56,149
partial match that's eliciting this kind
of a sense of

5192
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
of a sense of
 

5193
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:59,510
of a sense of
familiarity and uh and that's why you

5194
01:42:59,510 --> 01:42:59,520
familiarity and uh and that's why you
 

5195
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,270
familiarity and uh and that's why you
know in patients who have epilepsy that

5196
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,280
know in patients who have epilepsy that

affects memory you get this artificial

5198
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:03,800
affects memory you get this artificial
 

5199
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:06,870
affects memory you get this artificial
sense of familiarity that happens and so

5200
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:06,880
sense of familiarity that happens and so
 

5201
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:09,510
sense of familiarity that happens and so
we think that and again this is just one

5202
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:09,520
we think that and again this is just one
 

5203
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,550
we think that and again this is just one
Theory amongst many but we think that's

5204
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:11,560
Theory amongst many but we think that's
 

5205
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,510
Theory amongst many but we think that's
we get a little bit of that feeling it's

5206
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:14,520
we get a little bit of that feeling it's
 

5207
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:16,709
we get a little bit of that feeling it's
not enough to necessarily give you Deja

5208
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:16,719
not enough to necessarily give you Deja
 

5209
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:20,750
not enough to necessarily give you Deja
Vu even for very mundane things right so

5210
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:20,760
Vu even for very mundane things right so
 

5211
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:24,550
Vu even for very mundane things right so
it's like if I tell you the word rudaba

5212
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:24,560
it's like if I tell you the word rudaba
 

5213
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,030
it's like if I tell you the word rudaba
your brain's going to work a little bit

5214
01:43:26,030 --> 01:43:26,040
your brain's going to work a little bit
 

5215
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,870
your brain's going to work a little bit
harder to catch it than if I give you

5216
01:43:27,870 --> 01:43:27,880
harder to catch it than if I give you
 

5217
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:30,709
harder to catch it than if I give you
word like apple right um and that's

5218
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:30,719
word like apple right um and that's
 

5219
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,149
word like apple right um and that's
because you hear Apple a lot so your

5220
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:32,159
because you hear Apple a lot so your
 

5221
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,870
because you hear Apple a lot so your
brain's very tuned up to process it

5222
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:33,880
brain's very tuned up to process it
 

5223
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:36,229
brain's very tuned up to process it
efficiently but Ruda takes a little bit

5224
01:43:36,229 --> 01:43:36,239
efficiently but Ruda takes a little bit
 

5225
01:43:36,239 --> 01:43:37,669
efficiently but Ruda takes a little bit
longer and more intense and you can

5226
01:43:37,669 --> 01:43:37,679
longer and more intense and you can
 

5227
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:39,669
longer and more intense and you can
actually see a difference in brain

5228
01:43:39,669 --> 01:43:39,679
actually see a difference in brain
 

5229
01:43:39,679 --> 01:43:41,870
actually see a difference in brain
activity in areas in the temporal lobe

5230
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:41,880
activity in areas in the temporal lobe
 

5231
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,669
activity in areas in the temporal lobe
when you hear a word just based on how

5232
01:43:43,669 --> 01:43:43,679
when you hear a word just based on how
 

5233
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:46,510
when you hear a word just based on how
frequent it is in the English language

5234
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:46,520
frequent it is in the English language
 

5235
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:49,830
frequent it is in the English language
so fasc we think it's tied to this basic

5236
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:49,840
so fasc we think it's tied to this basic
 

5237
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,030
so fasc we think it's tied to this basic
it's a basically a byproduct of our

5238
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:52,040
it's a basically a byproduct of our
 

5239
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,070
it's a basically a byproduct of our
mechanism of just learning doing this

5240
01:43:55,070 --> 01:43:55,080
mechanism of just learning doing this
 

5241
01:43:55,080 --> 01:43:56,669
mechanism of just learning doing this
error-driven learning as we go through

5242
01:43:56,669 --> 01:43:56,679
error-driven learning as we go through
 

5243
01:43:56,679 --> 01:43:58,229
error-driven learning as we go through
life to become better and better and

5244
01:43:58,229 --> 01:43:58,239
life to become better and better and
 

5245
01:43:58,239 --> 01:44:00,070
life to become better and better and
better to process things more and more

5246
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:00,080
better to process things more and more
 

5247
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,990
better to process things more and more
efficiently so I guess Deja Vu is just

5248
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:02,000
efficiently so I guess Deja Vu is just
 

5249
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,470
efficiently so I guess Deja Vu is just
like an extra

5250
01:44:04,470 --> 01:44:04,480
like an extra
 

5251
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:07,790
like an extra
elevated stuff coming together firing

5252
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:07,800
elevated stuff coming together firing
 

5253
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:09,790
elevated stuff coming together firing
for this artificial memory as if it's

5254
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:09,800
for this artificial memory as if it's
 

5255
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,910
for this artificial memory as if it's
the real

5256
01:44:10,910 --> 01:44:10,920
the real
 

5257
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:13,950
the real
memory this I mean why does it feel so

5258
01:44:13,950 --> 01:44:13,960
memory this I mean why does it feel so
 

5259
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:16,310
memory this I mean why does it feel so
intense uh well it doesn't happen all

5260
01:44:16,310 --> 01:44:16,320
intense uh well it doesn't happen all
 

5261
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:17,910
intense uh well it doesn't happen all
the time but I think what may be

5262
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:17,920
the time but I think what may be
 

5263
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:21,149
the time but I think what may be
happening is it's such a it's a partial

5264
01:44:21,149 --> 01:44:21,159
happening is it's such a it's a partial
 

5265
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:23,270
happening is it's such a it's a partial
match to something that we have and it's

5266
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:23,280
match to something that we have and it's
 

5267
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,629
match to something that we have and it's
not enough to trigger that sense of you

5268
01:44:25,629 --> 01:44:25,639
not enough to trigger that sense of you
 

5269
01:44:25,639 --> 01:44:27,589
not enough to trigger that sense of you
know that ability to pull together all

5270
01:44:27,589 --> 01:44:27,599
know that ability to pull together all
 

5271
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:30,270
know that ability to pull together all
the pieces but it's a close enough match

5272
01:44:30,270 --> 01:44:30,280
the pieces but it's a close enough match
 

5273
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,430
the pieces but it's a close enough match
to give you that intense sense of

5274
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:32,440
to give you that intense sense of
 

5275
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:35,070
to give you that intense sense of
familiarity without the recollection of

5276
01:44:35,070 --> 01:44:35,080
familiarity without the recollection of
 

5277
01:44:35,080 --> 01:44:37,470
familiarity without the recollection of
exactly what happened when but it's also

5278
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:37,480
exactly what happened when but it's also
 

5279
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:41,430
exactly what happened when but it's also
like a spatial temporal familiarity so

5280
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:41,440
like a spatial temporal familiarity so
 

5281
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,750
like a spatial temporal familiarity so
like it's also in time like there's a

5282
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:43,760
like it's also in time like there's a
 

5283
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:47,669
like it's also in time like there's a
weird blending of time that happens um

5284
01:44:47,669 --> 01:44:47,679
weird blending of time that happens um
 

5285
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:49,070
weird blending of time that happens um
and we'll we'll probably talk about time

5286
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:49,080
and we'll we'll probably talk about time
 

5287
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:49,990
and we'll we'll probably talk about time
because I think that's a really

5288
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,000
because I think that's a really
 

5289
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,669
because I think that's a really
interesting idea how time relates to

5290
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:51,679
interesting idea how time relates to
 

5291
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:54,910
interesting idea how time relates to
memory but um you also kind of

5292
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:54,920
memory but um you also kind of
 

5293
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:58,350
memory but um you also kind of
artificial memory brings to mind this

5294
01:44:58,350 --> 01:44:58,360
artificial memory brings to mind this
 

5295
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:01,669
artificial memory brings to mind this
idea of false memories mhm that comes in

5296
01:45:01,669 --> 01:45:01,679
idea of false memories mhm that comes in
 

5297
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:04,189
idea of false memories mhm that comes in
all kinds of context but how do false

5298
01:45:04,189 --> 01:45:04,199
all kinds of context but how do false
 

5299
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:07,390
all kinds of context but how do false
memories form well I like to say there's

5300
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:07,400
memories form well I like to say there's
 

5301
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,990
memories form well I like to say there's
no such thing as true or false memories

5302
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:10,000
no such thing as true or false memories
 

5303
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,189
no such thing as true or false memories
right it's like a um Johnny Roden from

5304
01:45:12,189 --> 01:45:12,199
right it's like a um Johnny Roden from
 

5305
01:45:12,199 --> 01:45:13,830
right it's like a um Johnny Roden from
The Sex Pistols he had a saying that's

5306
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:13,840
The Sex Pistols he had a saying that's
 

5307
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,470
The Sex Pistols he had a saying that's
like I don't believe in false memories

5308
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:15,480
like I don't believe in false memories
 

5309
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:17,350
like I don't believe in false memories
anymore than I believe in false songs

5310
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:17,360
anymore than I believe in false songs
 

5311
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:20,550
anymore than I believe in false songs
right it's like um and so the basic idea

5312
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:20,560
right it's like um and so the basic idea
 

5313
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,109
right it's like um and so the basic idea
is is that we have these memories

5314
01:45:23,109 --> 01:45:23,119
is is that we have these memories
 

5315
01:45:23,119 --> 01:45:26,030
is is that we have these memories
reflect bits and pieces of what happened

5316
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:26,040
reflect bits and pieces of what happened
 

5317
01:45:26,040 --> 01:45:28,270
reflect bits and pieces of what happened
as well as our inferences and theories

5318
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:28,280
as well as our inferences and theories
 

5319
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,109
as well as our inferences and theories
right so I'm a scientist and I collect

5320
01:45:30,109 --> 01:45:30,119
right so I'm a scientist and I collect
 

5321
01:45:30,119 --> 01:45:33,229
right so I'm a scientist and I collect
data but I use I use theories to make

5322
01:45:33,229 --> 01:45:33,239
data but I use I use theories to make
 

5323
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:36,149
data but I use I use theories to make
sense of that data and so a memory is

5324
01:45:36,149 --> 01:45:36,159
sense of that data and so a memory is
 

5325
01:45:36,159 --> 01:45:38,430
sense of that data and so a memory is
kind of a mix of all these things so

5326
01:45:38,430 --> 01:45:38,440
kind of a mix of all these things so
 

5327
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,270
kind of a mix of all these things so
where memories can go off the deep end

5328
01:45:40,270 --> 01:45:40,280
where memories can go off the deep end
 

5329
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:41,589
where memories can go off the deep end
and become what we would call

5330
01:45:41,589 --> 01:45:41,599
and become what we would call
 

5331
01:45:41,599 --> 01:45:45,229
and become what we would call
conventionally as false memories are

5332
01:45:45,229 --> 01:45:45,239
conventionally as false memories are
 

5333
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:48,470
conventionally as false memories are
sometimes little distortions where we

5334
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:48,480
sometimes little distortions where we
 

5335
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:50,430
sometimes little distortions where we
filled in the blanks the gaps in our

5336
01:45:50,430 --> 01:45:50,440
filled in the blanks the gaps in our
 

5337
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,030
filled in the blanks the gaps in our
memory based on things that we know but

5338
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,040
memory based on things that we know but
 

5339
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,750
memory based on things that we know but
don't actually correspond to what

5340
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:54,760
don't actually correspond to what
 

5341
01:45:54,760 --> 01:46:00,229
don't actually correspond to what
happened right um so um if I were to

5342
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:00,239
happened right um so um if I were to
 

5343
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,510
happened right um so um if I were to
tell you that I'm like you know a story

5344
01:46:03,510 --> 01:46:03,520
tell you that I'm like you know a story
 

5345
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,270
tell you that I'm like you know a story
about this person who's like worried

5346
01:46:06,270 --> 01:46:06,280
about this person who's like worried
 

5347
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:08,390
about this person who's like worried
that they have cancer or something like

5348
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:08,400
that they have cancer or something like
 

5349
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:10,189
that they have cancer or something like
that and then you know they see a doctor

5350
01:46:10,189 --> 01:46:10,199
that and then you know they see a doctor
 

5351
01:46:10,199 --> 01:46:12,629
that and then you know they see a doctor
and the doctor says well things are very

5352
01:46:12,629 --> 01:46:12,639
and the doctor says well things are very
 

5353
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:14,709
and the doctor says well things are very
much like you would have expected or

5354
01:46:14,709 --> 01:46:14,719
much like you would have expected or
 

5355
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:16,189
much like you would have expected or
like you know what you were afraid of or

5356
01:46:16,189 --> 01:46:16,199
like you know what you were afraid of or
 

5357
01:46:16,199 --> 01:46:18,270
like you know what you were afraid of or
something when people remember that

5358
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:18,280
something when people remember that
 

5359
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:20,270
something when people remember that
they'll often remember well the doctor

5360
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:20,280
they'll often remember well the doctor
 

5361
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:23,270
they'll often remember well the doctor
told the patient that he had cancer even

5362
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:23,280
told the patient that he had cancer even
 

5363
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:24,750
told the patient that he had cancer even
if that wasn't in the story because

5364
01:46:24,750 --> 01:46:24,760
if that wasn't in the story because
 

5365
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,070
if that wasn't in the story because
they're infusing meaning into that story

5366
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:27,080
they're infusing meaning into that story
 

5367
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:30,070
they're infusing meaning into that story
right so that's a minor Distortion but

5368
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:30,080
right so that's a minor Distortion but
 

5369
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:31,910
right so that's a minor Distortion but
what happens is is that sometimes things

5370
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:31,920
what happens is is that sometimes things
 

5371
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:35,149
what happens is is that sometimes things
can really get out of hand where people

5372
01:46:35,149 --> 01:46:35,159
can really get out of hand where people
 

5373
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:36,589
can really get out of hand where people
have trouble telling the differen in

5374
01:46:36,589 --> 01:46:36,599
have trouble telling the differen in
 

5375
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:38,270
have trouble telling the differen in
things that they've imagined versus

5376
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:38,280
things that they've imagined versus
 

5377
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:40,669
things that they've imagined versus
things that happen but also as I told

5378
01:46:40,669 --> 01:46:40,679
things that happen but also as I told
 

5379
01:46:40,679 --> 01:46:43,229
things that happen but also as I told
you the act of remembering can change

5380
01:46:43,229 --> 01:46:43,239
you the act of remembering can change
 

5381
01:46:43,239 --> 01:46:47,189
you the act of remembering can change
the memory and so what happens then is

5382
01:46:47,189 --> 01:46:47,199
the memory and so what happens then is
 

5383
01:46:47,199 --> 01:46:49,070
the memory and so what happens then is
you can actually be exposed to some

5384
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:49,080
you can actually be exposed to some
 

5385
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,390
you can actually be exposed to some
misinformation and so Elizabeth Loftus

5386
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:51,400
misinformation and so Elizabeth Loftus
 

5387
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:53,350
misinformation and so Elizabeth Loftus
was a real Pioneer in the work and

5388
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:53,360
was a real Pioneer in the work and
 

5389
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,109
was a real Pioneer in the work and
there's lots of other work that's been

5390
01:46:55,109 --> 01:46:55,119
there's lots of other work that's been
 

5391
01:46:55,119 --> 01:46:58,030
there's lots of other work that's been
done since um but basically it's like if

5392
01:46:58,030 --> 01:46:58,040
done since um but basically it's like if
 

5393
01:46:58,040 --> 01:47:00,709
done since um but basically it's like if
you remember some event and then I tell

5394
01:47:00,709 --> 01:47:00,719
you remember some event and then I tell
 

5395
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:04,430
you remember some event and then I tell
you something about the event later on

5396
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:04,440
you something about the event later on
 

5397
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:06,350
you something about the event later on
when you remember the event you might

5398
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:06,360
when you remember the event you might
 

5399
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:08,149
when you remember the event you might
remember some original information from

5400
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:08,159
remember some original information from
 

5401
01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:10,830
remember some original information from
the event as well as some information

5402
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:10,840
the event as well as some information
 

5403
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,709
the event as well as some information
about what I told you and sometimes if

5404
01:47:13,709 --> 01:47:13,719
about what I told you and sometimes if
 

5405
01:47:13,719 --> 01:47:16,030
about what I told you and sometimes if
you're not able to tell the difference

5406
01:47:16,030 --> 01:47:16,040
you're not able to tell the difference
 

5407
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:17,750
you're not able to tell the difference
that information that I told you gets

5408
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:17,760
that information that I told you gets
 

5409
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:19,589
that information that I told you gets
mixed into the story that you had

5410
01:47:19,589 --> 01:47:19,599
mixed into the story that you had
 

5411
01:47:19,599 --> 01:47:22,070
mixed into the story that you had
originally so now I give you some more

5412
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,080
originally so now I give you some more
 

5413
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,870
originally so now I give you some more
misinformation or you're exposed to some

5414
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:23,880
misinformation or you're exposed to some
 

5415
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,830
misinformation or you're exposed to some
more information somewhere else and

5416
01:47:25,830 --> 01:47:25,840
more information somewhere else and
 

5417
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,109
more information somewhere else and
eventually your memory becomes totally

5418
01:47:28,109 --> 01:47:28,119
eventually your memory becomes totally
 

5419
01:47:28,119 --> 01:47:30,870
eventually your memory becomes totally
detached from what happened and so

5420
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:30,880
detached from what happened and so
 

5421
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,510
detached from what happened and so
sometimes you can have cases where

5422
01:47:32,510 --> 01:47:32,520
sometimes you can have cases where
 

5423
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:36,149
sometimes you can have cases where
people um this is very rare but you can

5424
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:36,159
people um this is very rare but you can
 

5425
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,910
people um this is very rare but you can
do it in the lab too or like a

5426
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:38,920
do it in the lab too or like a
 

5427
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:41,310
do it in the lab too or like a
significant not everybody but you know a

5428
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:41,320
significant not everybody but you know a
 

5429
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:43,910
significant not everybody but you know a
chunk of people will fall for this where

5430
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
chunk of people will fall for this where
 

5431
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,149
chunk of people will fall for this where
you can give people misinformation about

5432
01:47:47,149 --> 01:47:47,159
you can give people misinformation about
 

5433
01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:50,310
you can give people misinformation about
an event that never took place and as

5434
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:50,320
an event that never took place and as
 

5435
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,350
an event that never took place and as
they keep trying to remember that event

5436
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:52,360
they keep trying to remember that event
 

5437
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:53,709
they keep trying to remember that event
more and more more what happens they

5438
01:47:53,709 --> 01:47:53,719
more and more more what happens they
 

5439
01:47:53,719 --> 01:47:55,790
more and more more what happens they
start to imagine they start to pull up

5440
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:55,800
start to imagine they start to pull up
 

5441
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:57,550
start to imagine they start to pull up
things from other experiences they've

5442
01:47:57,550 --> 01:47:57,560
things from other experiences they've
 

5443
01:47:57,560 --> 01:47:59,709
things from other experiences they've
had and eventually they can stitch

5444
01:47:59,709 --> 01:47:59,719
had and eventually they can stitch
 

5445
01:47:59,719 --> 01:48:02,270
had and eventually they can stitch
together a vivid memory of something

5446
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:02,280
together a vivid memory of something
 

5447
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,910
together a vivid memory of something
that never happened because they're not

5448
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:04,920
that never happened because they're not
 

5449
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:07,310
that never happened because they're not
remembering an event that happened

5450
01:48:07,310 --> 01:48:07,320
remembering an event that happened
 

5451
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,950
remembering an event that happened
they're remembering the act of trying to

5452
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:09,960
they're remembering the act of trying to
 

5453
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:12,550
they're remembering the act of trying to
remember what happened and basically

5454
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:12,560
remember what happened and basically
 

5455
01:48:12,560 --> 01:48:14,790
remember what happened and basically
putting it together into the wrong story

5456
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:14,800
putting it together into the wrong story
 

5457
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:16,149
putting it together into the wrong story
so it's fascinating because this could

5458
01:48:16,149 --> 01:48:16,159
so it's fascinating because this could
 

5459
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:20,910
so it's fascinating because this could
probably happen at the a a collective

5460
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:20,920
probably happen at the a a collective
 

5461
01:48:20,920 --> 01:48:22,790
probably happen at the a a collective
level like this is probably what

5462
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:22,800
level like this is probably what
 

5463
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,550
level like this is probably what
successful propaganda machines aim to do

5464
01:48:25,550 --> 01:48:25,560
successful propaganda machines aim to do
 

5465
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:28,030
successful propaganda machines aim to do
this creating false memory across

5466
01:48:28,030 --> 01:48:28,040
this creating false memory across
 

5467
01:48:28,040 --> 01:48:30,669
this creating false memory across
thousands if not millions of Minds yeah

5468
01:48:30,669 --> 01:48:30,679
thousands if not millions of Minds yeah
 

5469
01:48:30,679 --> 01:48:33,750
thousands if not millions of Minds yeah
absolutely um I mean uh this is exactly

5470
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:33,760
absolutely um I mean uh this is exactly
 

5471
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,229
absolutely um I mean uh this is exactly
what they do and so all these kind of

5472
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:36,239
what they do and so all these kind of
 

5473
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,550
what they do and so all these kind of
foibles of human memory get magnified

5474
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:38,560
foibles of human memory get magnified
 

5475
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:39,750
foibles of human memory get magnified
when you start to have social

5476
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:39,760
when you start to have social
 

5477
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,750
when you start to have social
interactions there's a whole literature

5478
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:41,760
interactions there's a whole literature
 

5479
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:44,310
interactions there's a whole literature
on something called social contagion

5480
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:44,320
on something called social contagion
 

5481
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,310
on something called social contagion
which is basically when misinformation

5482
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,320
which is basically when misinformation
 

5483
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:49,310
which is basically when misinformation
spreads like a virus like you remember

5484
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:49,320
spreads like a virus like you remember
 

5485
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:51,550
spreads like a virus like you remember
the same thing that I did but I give you

5486
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:51,560
the same thing that I did but I give you
 

5487
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,390
the same thing that I did but I give you
a little bit of wrong information

5488
01:48:53,390 --> 01:48:53,400
a little bit of wrong information
 

5489
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,510
a little bit of wrong information
then that becomes part of your story of

5490
01:48:55,510 --> 01:48:55,520
then that becomes part of your story of
 

5491
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,709
then that becomes part of your story of
what happened because once you and I

5492
01:48:57,709 --> 01:48:57,719
what happened because once you and I
 

5493
01:48:57,719 --> 01:49:00,229
what happened because once you and I
share a memory like I tell you about

5494
01:49:00,229 --> 01:49:00,239
share a memory like I tell you about
 

5495
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:01,589
share a memory like I tell you about
something I've experience and you tell

5496
01:49:01,589 --> 01:49:01,599
something I've experience and you tell
 

5497
01:49:01,599 --> 01:49:03,270
something I've experience and you tell
me about your experience of the same

5498
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:03,280
me about your experience of the same
 

5499
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,709
me about your experience of the same
event it's no longer your memory or my

5500
01:49:05,709 --> 01:49:05,719
event it's no longer your memory or my
 

5501
01:49:05,719 --> 01:49:08,750
event it's no longer your memory or my
memory it's our memory and so now the

5502
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:08,760
memory it's our memory and so now the
 

5503
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,709
memory it's our memory and so now the
misinformation spreads and the more you

5504
01:49:10,709 --> 01:49:10,719
misinformation spreads and the more you
 

5505
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:13,390
misinformation spreads and the more you
trust someone or the more powerful that

5506
01:49:13,390 --> 01:49:13,400
trust someone or the more powerful that
 

5507
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:16,390
trust someone or the more powerful that
person is the more of a voice they have

5508
01:49:16,390 --> 01:49:16,400
person is the more of a voice they have
 

5509
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,790
person is the more of a voice they have
in shaping that narrative right um and

5510
01:49:19,790 --> 01:49:19,800
in shaping that narrative right um and
 

5511
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,270
in shaping that narrative right um and
and there's all sorts of interesting

5512
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:21,280
and there's all sorts of interesting
 

5513
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,790
and there's all sorts of interesting
ways in which misinformation can

5514
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:22,800
ways in which misinformation can
 

5515
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,030
ways in which misinformation can
happened there's a great example of when

5516
01:49:26,030 --> 01:49:26,040
happened there's a great example of when
 

5517
01:49:26,040 --> 01:49:30,669
happened there's a great example of when
John McCain and George Bush Jr were um

5518
01:49:30,669 --> 01:49:30,679
John McCain and George Bush Jr were um
 

5519
01:49:30,679 --> 01:49:33,990
John McCain and George Bush Jr were um
in a primary and there were these polls

5520
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,000
in a primary and there were these polls
 

5521
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,990
in a primary and there were these polls
where they would do these like I guess

5522
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:36,000
where they would do these like I guess
 

5523
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,910
where they would do these like I guess
they were like not rooc calls but real

5524
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:37,920
they were like not rooc calls but real
 

5525
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,430
they were like not rooc calls but real
calls where they would PLL voters but

5526
01:49:40,430 --> 01:49:40,440
calls where they would PLL voters but
 

5527
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,830
calls where they would PLL voters but
they actually inserted some

5528
01:49:42,830 --> 01:49:42,840
they actually inserted some
 

5529
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:45,550
they actually inserted some
misinformation about McCain's beliefs on

5530
01:49:45,550 --> 01:49:45,560
misinformation about McCain's beliefs on
 

5531
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:47,030
misinformation about McCain's beliefs on
taxation I think and maybe it was

5532
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:47,040
taxation I think and maybe it was
 

5533
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:48,550
taxation I think and maybe it was
something about illegitimate children or

5534
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:48,560
something about illegitimate children or
 

5535
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:50,629
something about illegitimate children or
I don't really remember but they

5536
01:49:50,629 --> 01:49:50,639
I don't really remember but they
 

5537
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:53,109
I don't really remember but they
included misinformation in the quest

5538
01:49:53,109 --> 01:49:53,119
included misinformation in the quest
 

5539
01:49:53,119 --> 01:49:54,790
included misinformation in the quest
that they asked like you know how do you

5540
01:49:54,790 --> 01:49:54,800
that they asked like you know how do you
 

5541
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:57,390
that they asked like you know how do you
feel about the fact that he wants to do

5542
01:49:57,390 --> 01:49:57,400
feel about the fact that he wants to do
 

5543
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,629
feel about the fact that he wants to do
this or something and so people would

5544
01:49:59,629 --> 01:49:59,639
this or something and so people would
 

5545
01:49:59,639 --> 01:50:01,990
this or something and so people would
end up becoming convinced he had these

5546
01:50:01,990 --> 01:50:02,000
end up becoming convinced he had these
 

5547
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,430
end up becoming convinced he had these
you know policy things or these personal

5548
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:04,440
you know policy things or these personal
 

5549
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:06,870
you know policy things or these personal
things that were not true just based on

5550
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:06,880
things that were not true just based on
 

5551
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,070
things that were not true just based on
the polls that were being used so it was

5552
01:50:09,070 --> 01:50:09,080
the polls that were being used so it was
 

5553
01:50:09,080 --> 01:50:11,669
the polls that were being used so it was
a case where interestingly

5554
01:50:11,669 --> 01:50:11,679
a case where interestingly
 

5555
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:15,149
a case where interestingly
enough the people who were using

5556
01:50:15,149 --> 01:50:15,159
enough the people who were using
 

5557
01:50:15,159 --> 01:50:17,470
enough the people who were using
misinformation were actually ahead of

5558
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:17,480
misinformation were actually ahead of
 

5559
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,350
misinformation were actually ahead of
the curve relative to the scientists who

5560
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:19,360
the curve relative to the scientists who
 

5561
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:21,510
the curve relative to the scientists who
were trying to study these effects in

5562
01:50:21,510 --> 01:50:21,520
were trying to study these effects in
 

5563
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:24,709
were trying to study these effects in
memory yeah yeah it's

5564
01:50:24,709 --> 01:50:24,719
memory yeah yeah it's
 

5565
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,149
memory yeah yeah it's
um it's really interesting so it's not

5566
01:50:27,149 --> 01:50:27,159
um it's really interesting so it's not
 

5567
01:50:27,159 --> 01:50:31,270
um it's really interesting so it's not
just about truth and falsehoods like us

5568
01:50:31,270 --> 01:50:31,280
just about truth and falsehoods like us
 

5569
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:36,149
just about truth and falsehoods like us
as intelligent reasoning machines but

5570
01:50:36,149 --> 01:50:36,159
as intelligent reasoning machines but
 

5571
01:50:36,159 --> 01:50:37,830
as intelligent reasoning machines but
it's the formation of memories where

5572
01:50:37,830 --> 01:50:37,840
it's the formation of memories where
 

5573
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:39,950
it's the formation of memories where
they become like visceral you can

5574
01:50:39,950 --> 01:50:39,960
they become like visceral you can
 

5575
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:41,990
they become like visceral you can
rewrite history if you just look

5576
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,000
rewrite history if you just look
 

5577
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,390
rewrite history if you just look

5578
01:50:44,390 --> 01:50:44,400
throughout the 20th
 

5579
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,669
throughout the 20th
century uh some of the dictatorships

re re write our conceptions of History

how we remember our own culture our

5595
01:51:00,599 --> 01:51:02,350
you could do quite a lot of damage in
this way and then there's probably some

5596
01:51:02,350 --> 01:51:02,360
this way and then there's probably some
 

5597
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:05,310
this way and then there's probably some
kind of social contagion happening

collective identity is very much tied to
 

5651
01:52:10,239 --> 01:52:12,750
collective identity is very much tied to
Shared memories if we have a shared

5652

part of my tribe if I remember the same
same things in the same way and you

01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:25,040
same things in the same way and you
 

5665
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,550
same things in the same way and you
brought up this weaponization of history

5666
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:27,560
brought up this weaponization of history
 

5667
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:29,589
brought up this weaponization of history
and you know it really speaks to I think

5668
01:52:29,589 --> 01:52:29,599
and you know it really speaks to I think
 

5669
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:31,950
and you know it really speaks to I think
one of the parts of memory which is that

5670
01:52:31,950 --> 01:52:31,960
one of the parts of memory which is that
 

5671
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:35,950
one of the parts of memory which is that
if you have a belief you will find and

5672
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:35,960
if you have a belief you will find and
 

5673
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:38,149
if you have a belief you will find and
you have a goal in mind you will find

5674
01:52:38,149 --> 01:52:38,159
you have a goal in mind you will find
 

5675
01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:40,189
you have a goal in mind you will find
stuff in memory that aligns with it and

5676
01:52:40,189 --> 01:52:40,199
stuff in memory that aligns with it and
 

5677
01:52:40,199 --> 01:52:42,310
stuff in memory that aligns with it and
you won't see the parts in memory that

5678
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:42,320
you won't see the parts in memory that
 

5679
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,629
you won't see the parts in memory that
don't so a lot of the stories we put

5680
01:52:44,629 --> 01:52:44,639
don't so a lot of the stories we put
 

5681
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,510
don't so a lot of the stories we put
together are based on our

5682
01:52:46,510 --> 01:52:46,520
together are based on our
 

5683
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:49,350
together are based on our
perspectives right and so let's let's

5684
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:49,360
perspectives right and so let's let's
 

5685
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:51,830
perspectives right and so let's let's
just zoom out for the M moment from like

5686
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:51,840
just zoom out for the M moment from like
 

5687
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,350
just zoom out for the M moment from like
misinformation should take something

5688
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:53,360
misinformation should take something
 

5689
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:56,709
misinformation should take something
even more fascinating but not as like

5690
01:52:56,709 --> 01:52:56,719
even more fascinating but not as like
 

5691
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:00,470
even more fascinating but not as like
you know scary um I was reading uh ton

5692
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:00,480
you know scary um I was reading uh ton
 

5693
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,390
you know scary um I was reading uh ton
vietn but he wrote a book about the

5694
01:53:03,390 --> 01:53:03,400
vietn but he wrote a book about the
 

5695
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,149
vietn but he wrote a book about the
collective memory of the Vietnam War

5696
01:53:05,149 --> 01:53:05,159
collective memory of the Vietnam War
 

5697
01:53:05,159 --> 01:53:07,709
collective memory of the Vietnam War
he's a Vietnamese um immigrant who was

5698
01:53:07,709 --> 01:53:07,719
he's a Vietnamese um immigrant who was
 

5699
01:53:07,719 --> 01:53:10,629
he's a Vietnamese um immigrant who was
flown out as um after the war was over

5700
01:53:10,629 --> 01:53:10,639
flown out as um after the war was over
 

5701
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:12,790
flown out as um after the war was over
and so he went back to his family to get

5702
01:53:12,790 --> 01:53:12,800
and so he went back to his family to get
 

5703
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,790
and so he went back to his family to get
their stories about the war and they

5704
01:53:15,790 --> 01:53:15,800
their stories about the war and they
 

5705
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,830
their stories about the war and they
called it the American war not the

5706
01:53:17,830 --> 01:53:17,840
called it the American war not the
 

5707
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:21,669
called it the American war not the
Vietnam War right and that just kind of

5708
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:21,679
Vietnam War right and that just kind of
 

5709
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:23,750
Vietnam War right and that just kind of
blew my mind having grown up in the US

5710
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
blew my mind having grown up in the US
 

5711
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:25,310
blew my mind having grown up in the US
and having always heard about it as a

5712
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:25,320
and having always heard about it as a
 

5713
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:26,950
and having always heard about it as a
Vietnam War but of course they call it

5714
01:53:26,950 --> 01:53:26,960
Vietnam War but of course they call it
 

5715
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,229
Vietnam War but of course they call it
the American war because that's what

5716
01:53:28,229 --> 01:53:28,239
the American war because that's what
 

5717
01:53:28,239 --> 01:53:30,589
the American war because that's what
happened America came in right and

5718
01:53:30,589 --> 01:53:30,599
happened America came in right and
 

5719
01:53:30,599 --> 01:53:32,790
happened America came in right and
that's based on their perspective which

5720
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:32,800
that's based on their perspective which
 

5721
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:35,390
that's based on their perspective which
is a very valid

5722
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:35,400
is a very valid
 

5723
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:38,669
is a very valid
perspective um and so that just gives

5724
01:53:38,669 --> 01:53:38,679
perspective um and so that just gives
 

5725
01:53:38,679 --> 01:53:41,470
perspective um and so that just gives
you this idea of the way we put together

5726
01:53:41,470 --> 01:53:41,480
you this idea of the way we put together
 

5727
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:43,030
you this idea of the way we put together
these narratives based on our

5728
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:43,040
these narratives based on our
 

5729
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,390
these narratives based on our
perspectives and I think the the the

5730
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:46,400
perspectives and I think the the the
 

5731
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,430
perspectives and I think the the the
opportunities that we can have in memory

5732
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,440
opportunities that we can have in memory
 

5733
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:52,510
opportunities that we can have in memory
is if we bring groups together from

5734
01:53:52,510 --> 01:53:52,520
is if we bring groups together from
 

5735
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:55,270
is if we bring groups together from
different perspectives and we allow them

5736
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:55,280
different perspectives and we allow them
 

5737
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,830
different perspectives and we allow them
to talk to each other and we allow

5738
01:53:56,830 --> 01:53:56,840
to talk to each other and we allow
 

5739
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:58,910
to talk to each other and we allow
ourselves to listen I mean right now

5740
01:53:58,910 --> 01:53:58,920
ourselves to listen I mean right now
 

5741
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:01,950
ourselves to listen I mean right now
you'll hear a lot of just Jammer you

about lety Bruce got canceled for
 

5757

about lety Bruce got canceled for
cursing Jesus Christ you know it's like

cursing Jesus Christ you know it's like
 

5759
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:23,709
cursing Jesus Christ you know it's like
this is nothing new people like to hear

5760
01:54:23,709 --> 01:54:23,719
this is nothing new people like to hear
 

5761
01:54:23,719 --> 01:54:27,510
this is nothing new people like to hear
things that disagree with them but um if

5762
01:54:27,510 --> 01:54:27,520
things that disagree with them but um if
 

5763
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,709
things that disagree with them but um if
you're in I mean you can see two

5764
01:54:29,709 --> 01:54:29,719
you're in I mean you can see two
 

5765
01:54:29,719 --> 01:54:32,990
you're in I mean you can see two
situations in groups with memory one

5766
01:54:32,990 --> 01:54:33,000
situations in groups with memory one
 

5767
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,550
situations in groups with memory one
situation is you have like people who

5768
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:35,560
situation is you have like people who
 

5769
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:37,629
situation is you have like people who
are very dominant who just take over the

5770
01:54:37,629 --> 01:54:37,639
are very dominant who just take over the
 

5771
01:54:37,639 --> 01:54:39,990
are very dominant who just take over the
conversation and they basically what

5772
01:54:39,990 --> 01:54:40,000
conversation and they basically what
 

5773
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,870
conversation and they basically what
happens is the group remembers less from

5774
01:54:41,870 --> 01:54:41,880
happens is the group remembers less from
 

5775
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:44,109
happens is the group remembers less from
the experience and they remember more of

5776
01:54:44,109 --> 01:54:44,119
the experience and they remember more of
 

5777
01:54:44,119 --> 01:54:46,629
the experience and they remember more of
what the dominant narrator says right

5778
01:54:46,629 --> 01:54:46,639
what the dominant narrator says right
 

5779
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:48,270
what the dominant narrator says right
now if you have a diverse group of

5780
01:54:48,270 --> 01:54:48,280
now if you have a diverse group of
 

5781
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:50,390
now if you have a diverse group of
people and I don't mean diverse in

5782
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:50,400
people and I don't mean diverse in
 

5783
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,830
people and I don't mean diverse in
necessarily the human resources sense of

5784
01:54:52,830 --> 01:54:52,840
necessarily the human resources sense of
 

5785
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,589
necessarily the human resources sense of
the word I mean diverse in any way you

5786
01:54:54,589 --> 01:54:54,599
the word I mean diverse in any way you
 

5787
01:54:54,599 --> 01:54:56,149
the word I mean diverse in any way you
want to take it right but diverse in

5788
01:54:56,149 --> 01:54:56,159
want to take it right but diverse in
 

5789
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:58,270
want to take it right but diverse in
every way hopefully and you give

5790
01:54:58,270 --> 01:54:58,280
every way hopefully and you give
 

5791
01:54:58,280 --> 01:54:59,870
every way hopefully and you give
everyone a chance to speak and

5792
01:54:59,870 --> 01:54:59,880
everyone a chance to speak and
 

5793

everyone's being appreciated for their
 

5795
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,430
everyone's being appreciated for their
unique contribution you get more

5796
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:04,440
unique contribution you get more
 

5797
01:55:04,440 --> 01:55:05,990
unique contribution you get more
accurate memories and you get more

5798
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
accurate memories and you get more
 

5799
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,910
accurate memories and you get more
information from it right um even two

5800
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:08,920
information from it right um even two
 

5801
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:10,350
information from it right um even two
people who come from very similar

5802
01:55:10,350 --> 01:55:10,360
people who come from very similar
 

5803
01:55:10,360 --> 01:55:12,149
people who come from very similar
backgrounds if you can appreciate the

5804
01:55:12,149 --> 01:55:12,159
backgrounds if you can appreciate the
 

5805
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:14,750
backgrounds if you can appreciate the
unique contributions that each one has

5806
01:55:14,750 --> 01:55:14,760
unique contributions that each one has
 

5807
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:16,669
unique contributions that each one has
you can do a better job of generating

5808
01:55:16,669 --> 01:55:16,679
you can do a better job of generating
 

5809
01:55:16,679 --> 01:55:19,030
you can do a better job of generating
information from memory and that's a way

5810
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:19,040
information from memory and that's a way
 

5811
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,229
information from memory and that's a way
to inoculate ourselves I believe from

5812
01:55:21,229 --> 01:55:21,239
to inoculate ourselves I believe from
 

5813
01:55:21,239 --> 01:55:24,350
to inoculate ourselves I believe from
misinformation in the Modern World um

5814
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:24,360
misinformation in the Modern World um
 

5815
01:55:24,360 --> 01:55:26,430
misinformation in the Modern World um
but like everything else it requires a

5816
01:55:26,430 --> 01:55:26,440
but like everything else it requires a
 

5817
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:28,629
but like everything else it requires a
certain tolerance for discomfort and I

5818
01:55:28,629 --> 01:55:28,639
certain tolerance for discomfort and I
 

5819
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:31,629
certain tolerance for discomfort and I
think when we don't have much time and I

5820
01:55:31,629 --> 01:55:31,639
think when we don't have much time and I
 

5821
01:55:31,639 --> 01:55:33,790
think when we don't have much time and I
think when we're stressed out and when

5822
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:33,800
think when we're stressed out and when
 

5823
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:36,990
think when we're stressed out and when
we are just tired it's very hard to

5824
01:55:36,990 --> 01:55:37,000
we are just tired it's very hard to
 

5825
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,030
we are just tired it's very hard to
tolerate

5826
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:38,040
tolerate
 

5827
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:40,950
tolerate
discomfort and I mean social media has a

5828
01:55:40,950 --> 01:55:40,960
discomfort and I mean social media has a
 

5829
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:43,750
discomfort and I mean social media has a
lot of opportunity for this because it

5830
01:55:43,750 --> 01:55:43,760
lot of opportunity for this because it
 

5831
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:46,270
lot of opportunity for this because it
enables this distributed one-on-one

5832
01:55:46,270 --> 01:55:46,280
enables this distributed one-on-one
 

5833
01:55:46,280 --> 01:55:47,790
enables this distributed one-on-one
interaction that you're talking about

5834
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:47,800
interaction that you're talking about
 

5835
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:50,589
interaction that you're talking about
where everybody has a voice but still

5836
01:55:50,589 --> 01:55:50,599
where everybody has a voice but still
 

5837
01:55:50,599 --> 01:55:53,229
where everybody has a voice but still
our natural inclination you see this on

5838
01:55:53,229 --> 01:55:53,239
our natural inclination you see this on
 

5839
01:55:53,239 --> 01:55:54,510
our natural inclination you see this on
social media there's a natural

5840
01:55:54,510 --> 01:55:54,520
social media there's a natural
 

5841
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,390
social media there's a natural
clustering of people and opinions and

5842
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:56,400
clustering of people and opinions and
 

5843
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:58,910
clustering of people and opinions and
you just kind of you form these kind of

5844
01:55:58,910 --> 01:55:58,920
you just kind of you form these kind of
 

5845
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:01,990
you just kind of you form these kind of
bubbles I think that's a to me

5846
01:56:01,990 --> 01:56:02,000
bubbles I think that's a to me
 

5847
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,310
bubbles I think that's a to me
personally I think that's a technology

5848
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:03,320
personally I think that's a technology
 

5849
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:05,550
personally I think that's a technology
problem that could be solved if there's

5850
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:05,560
problem that could be solved if there's
 

5851
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:08,350
problem that could be solved if there's
a little bit of interaction kind

5852
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:08,360
a little bit of interaction kind
 

5853
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:10,069
a little bit of interaction kind
respectful compassion interaction with

5854
01:56:10,069 --> 01:56:10,079
respectful compassion interaction with
 

5855
01:56:10,079 --> 01:56:13,149
respectful compassion interaction with
people that have a very different memory

5856
01:56:13,149 --> 01:56:13,159
people that have a very different memory
 

5857
01:56:13,159 --> 01:56:16,270
people that have a very different memory
that that respectful interaction will

5858
01:56:16,270 --> 01:56:16,280
that that respectful interaction will
 

5859
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:19,149
that that respectful interaction will
start to intermix the memories and ways

5860
01:56:19,149 --> 01:56:19,159
start to intermix the memories and ways
 

5861
01:56:19,159 --> 01:56:22,310
start to intermix the memories and ways
of thinking to where you're slowly

5862
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:22,320
of thinking to where you're slowly
 

5863
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,990
of thinking to where you're slowly
moving towards truth but that's a

5864
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:24,000
moving towards truth but that's a
 

5865
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,470
moving towards truth but that's a
technology problem because uh naturally

5866
01:56:27,470 --> 01:56:27,480
technology problem because uh naturally
 

5867
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:29,270
technology problem because uh naturally
left our own devices we want to Cluster

5868
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:29,280
left our own devices we want to Cluster
 

5869
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:32,229
left our own devices we want to Cluster
up in a tribe yeah and that's the human

5870
01:56:32,229 --> 01:56:32,239
up in a tribe yeah and that's the human
 

5871
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:35,229
up in a tribe yeah and that's the human
problem you know I think a lot of the

5872
01:56:35,229 --> 01:56:35,239
problem you know I think a lot of the
 

5873
01:56:35,239 --> 01:56:37,189
problem you know I think a lot of the
problems that come up with technology

5874
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:37,199
problems that come up with technology
 

5875
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:39,510
problems that come up with technology
aren't the technology itself as much as

5876
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:39,520
aren't the technology itself as much as
 

5877
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:41,910
aren't the technology itself as much as
the fact that people adapt to the

5878
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:41,920
the fact that people adapt to the
 

5879
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:45,589
the fact that people adapt to the
technology in maladaptive ways I mean

5880
01:56:45,589 --> 01:56:45,599
technology in maladaptive ways I mean
 

5881
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:48,910
technology in maladaptive ways I mean
one of my fears about AI is not what AI

5882
01:56:48,910 --> 01:56:48,920
one of my fears about AI is not what AI
 

5883
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:50,870
one of my fears about AI is not what AI
will do but what people will do I mean

5884
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:50,880
will do but what people will do I mean
 

5885
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,830
will do but what people will do I mean
take text messaging right it's like it's

5886
01:56:52,830 --> 01:56:52,840
take text messaging right it's like it's
 

5887
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:54,550
take text messaging right it's like it's
pain in the ass to text people at least

5888
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:54,560
pain in the ass to text people at least
 

5889
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:56,750
pain in the ass to text people at least
for me and so what happens is the

5890
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:56,760
for me and so what happens is the
 

5891
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,950
for me and so what happens is the
communication becomes very Spartan and

5892
01:56:58,950 --> 01:56:58,960
communication becomes very Spartan and
 

5893
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:01,669
communication becomes very Spartan and
devoid of meaning right it's just very

5894
01:57:01,669 --> 01:57:01,679
devoid of meaning right it's just very
 

5895
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:04,030
devoid of meaning right it's just very
telegraphic and that's people adapting

5896
01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:04,040
telegraphic and that's people adapting
 

5897
01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:05,750
telegraphic and that's people adapting
to the medium right I mean look at you

5898
01:57:05,750 --> 01:57:05,760
to the medium right I mean look at you
 

5899
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,950
to the medium right I mean look at you
you've got this uh keyboard right that's

5900
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:07,960
you've got this uh keyboard right that's
 

5901
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:10,030
you've got this uh keyboard right that's
like got these like Dome shaped things

5902
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:10,040
like got these like Dome shaped things
 

5903
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:11,510
like got these like Dome shaped things
and you've adapted to that to

5904
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:11,520
and you've adapted to that to
 

5905
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,430
and you've adapted to that to
communicate right that's not the

5906
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:13,440
communicate right that's not the
 

5907
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,270
communicate right that's not the
technology adapting to you that's you

5908
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:15,280
technology adapting to you that's you
 

5909
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,750
technology adapting to you that's you
adapting to the technology and I think

5910
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:17,760
adapting to the technology and I think
 

5911
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:18,669
adapting to the technology and I think
with you know one of the things I

5912
01:57:18,669 --> 01:57:18,679
with you know one of the things I
 

5913
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:20,709
with you know one of the things I
learned when Google started to introduce

5914
01:57:20,709 --> 01:57:20,719
learned when Google started to introduce
 

5915
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:23,350
learned when Google started to introduce
autocomplete and emails I started to use

5916
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,360
autocomplete and emails I started to use
 

5917
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,709
autocomplete and emails I started to use
it and about a third of the time I was

5918
01:57:25,709 --> 01:57:25,719
it and about a third of the time I was
 

5919
01:57:25,719 --> 01:57:27,950
it and about a third of the time I was
like this isn't what I want to say a

5920
01:57:27,950 --> 01:57:27,960
like this isn't what I want to say a
 

5921
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,430
like this isn't what I want to say a
third of the time I'd be like this is

5922
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:29,440
third of the time I'd be like this is
 

5923
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,390
third of the time I'd be like this is
exactly what I wanted to say and a third

5924
01:57:31,390 --> 01:57:31,400
exactly what I wanted to say and a third
 

5925
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:32,709
exactly what I wanted to say and a third
of the time I was saying well this is

5926
01:57:32,709 --> 01:57:32,719
of the time I was saying well this is
 

5927
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:35,510
of the time I was saying well this is
good enough I'll just go with it right

5928
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:35,520
good enough I'll just go with it right
 

5929
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,669
good enough I'll just go with it right
and so what happens is it's not that the

5930
01:57:37,669 --> 01:57:37,679
and so what happens is it's not that the
 

5931
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:40,390
and so what happens is it's not that the
technology necessarily is doing anything

5932
01:57:40,390 --> 01:57:40,400
technology necessarily is doing anything
 

5933
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:43,189
technology necessarily is doing anything
so bad as much as it's just going to

5934
01:57:43,189 --> 01:57:43,199
so bad as much as it's just going to
 

5935
01:57:43,199 --> 01:57:45,950
so bad as much as it's just going to
constrain my language because I'm just

5936
01:57:45,950 --> 01:57:45,960
constrain my language because I'm just
 

5937
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,109
constrain my language because I'm just
doing what's being suggested to me and

5938
01:57:49,109 --> 01:57:49,119
doing what's being suggested to me and
 

5939
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:51,350
doing what's being suggested to me and
so this is why I say you know kind of

5940
01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:51,360
so this is why I say you know kind of
 

5941
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:54,270
so this is why I say you know kind of
like my manthra for some of what I've

5942
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:54,280
like my manthra for some of what I've
 

5943
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:56,990
like my manthra for some of what I've
learned about everything in memory is to

5944
01:57:56,990 --> 01:57:57,000
learned about everything in memory is to
 

5945
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,790
learned about everything in memory is to
diversify your training data basically

5946
01:57:59,790 --> 01:57:59,800
diversify your training data basically
 

5947
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,390
diversify your training data basically
because otherwise you're going to be so

5948
01:58:02,390 --> 01:58:02,400
because otherwise you're going to be so
 

5949
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,149
because otherwise you're going to be so
like humans have this capability to be

5950
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:04,159
like humans have this capability to be
 

5951
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:06,390
like humans have this capability to be
so much more creative than anything

5952
01:58:06,390 --> 01:58:06,400
so much more creative than anything
 

5953
01:58:06,400 --> 01:58:08,830
so much more creative than anything
generative AI will put together at least

5954
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:08,840
generative AI will put together at least
 

5955
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:12,149
generative AI will put together at least
right now who knows where this goes but

5956
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:12,159
right now who knows where this goes but
 

5957
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:14,109
right now who knows where this goes but
it can also go the opposite direction

5958
01:58:14,109 --> 01:58:14,119
it can also go the opposite direction
 

5959
01:58:14,119 --> 01:58:16,229
it can also go the opposite direction
where people could become much much less

5960
01:58:16,229 --> 01:58:16,239
where people could become much much less
 

5961
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:18,790
where people could become much much less
creative if they just become more and

5962
01:58:18,790 --> 01:58:18,800
creative if they just become more and
 

5963
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,229
creative if they just become more and
more like resistant to discomfort you

5964
01:58:22,229 --> 01:58:22,239
more like resistant to discomfort you
 

5965
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:24,910
more like resistant to discomfort you
know and resistant to exposing

5966
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:24,920
know and resistant to exposing
 

5967
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:26,950
know and resistant to exposing
themselves to novelty to cognitive

5968
01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:26,960
themselves to novelty to cognitive
 

5969
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,510
themselves to novelty to cognitive
dissonance and so forth I think there is

5970
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:29,520
dissonance and so forth I think there is
 

5971
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,990
dissonance and so forth I think there is
a dance between natural human adaptation

5972
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:32,000
a dance between natural human adaptation
 

5973
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,589
a dance between natural human adaptation
of technology and the people that uh the

5974
01:58:34,589 --> 01:58:34,599
of technology and the people that uh the
 

5975
01:58:34,599 --> 01:58:36,030
of technology and the people that uh the
design the engineering of that

5976
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:36,040
design the engineering of that
 

5977
01:58:36,040 --> 01:58:37,990
design the engineering of that
technology so I think there's a lot of

5978
01:58:37,990 --> 01:58:38,000
technology so I think there's a lot of
 

5979
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,550
technology so I think there's a lot of
opportunity to create like this keyboard

5980
01:58:40,550 --> 01:58:40,560
opportunity to create like this keyboard
 

5981
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:44,310
opportunity to create like this keyboard
things that on net are positive for uh

5982
01:58:44,310 --> 01:58:44,320
things that on net are positive for uh
 

5983
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,750
things that on net are positive for uh
human behavior so we adapt and all this

5984
01:58:46,750 --> 01:58:46,760
human behavior so we adapt and all this
 

5985
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:49,990
human behavior so we adapt and all this
kind of stuff but when you look at the

5986
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:50,000
kind of stuff but when you look at the
 

5987
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,229
kind of stuff but when you look at the
long Arc of History across years and

5988
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:52,239
long Arc of History across years and
 

5989
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:56,189
long Arc of History across years and
cases has Humanity been flourishing are

5990
01:58:56,189 --> 01:58:56,199
cases has Humanity been flourishing are
 

5991
01:58:56,199 --> 01:58:58,589
cases has Humanity been flourishing are
are humans creating more awesome stuff

5992
01:58:58,589 --> 01:58:58,599
are humans creating more awesome stuff
 

5993
01:58:58,599 --> 01:59:00,109
are humans creating more awesome stuff
are humans happier all that kind of

5994
01:59:00,109 --> 01:59:00,119
are humans happier all that kind of
 

5995
01:59:00,119 --> 01:59:01,990
are humans happier all that kind of
stuff and so there I think technology

5996
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:02,000
stuff and so there I think technology
 

5997
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,870
stuff and so there I think technology
onet is uh has been and I think maybe

5998
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:06,880
onet is uh has been and I think maybe
 

5999
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,589
onet is uh has been and I think maybe
hope will always will always be on that

6000
01:59:09,589 --> 01:59:09,599
hope will always will always be on that
 

6001
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:11,589
hope will always will always be on that
a positive thing do you think people are

6002
01:59:11,589 --> 01:59:11,599
a positive thing do you think people are
 

6003
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:13,589
a positive thing do you think people are
happier now than they were 50 years ago

6004
01:59:13,589 --> 01:59:13,599
happier now than they were 50 years ago
 

6005
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:16,709
happier now than they were 50 years ago
or 100 years ago yes yes I don't know

6006
01:59:16,709 --> 01:59:16,719
or 100 years ago yes yes I don't know
 

6007
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:19,229
or 100 years ago yes yes I don't know
about that I think humans in

6008
01:59:19,229 --> 01:59:19,239
about that I think humans in
 

6009
01:59:19,239 --> 01:59:23,270
about that I think humans in
general like to uh remin about the past

6010
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:23,280
general like to uh remin about the past
 

6011
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,830
general like to uh remin about the past
like the times are better true and

6012
01:59:25,830 --> 01:59:25,840
like the times are better true and
 

6013
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,709
like the times are better true and
complain about the weather today or

6014
01:59:27,709 --> 01:59:27,719
complain about the weather today or
 

6015
01:59:27,719 --> 01:59:29,950
complain about the weather today or
complain about whatever today cuz we

6016
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:29,960
complain about whatever today cuz we
 

6017
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:32,990
complain about whatever today cuz we
there's this kind of complainy engine

6018
01:59:32,990 --> 01:59:33,000
there's this kind of complainy engine
 

6019
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,669
there's this kind of complainy engine
that just there's so much pleasure in

6020
01:59:34,669 --> 01:59:34,679
that just there's so much pleasure in
 

6021
01:59:34,679 --> 01:59:38,589
that just there's so much pleasure in
saying you know life sucks for some

6022
01:59:38,589 --> 01:59:38,599
saying you know life sucks for some
 

6023
01:59:38,599 --> 01:59:41,310
saying you know life sucks for some
reason and that's why I love punk rock

6024
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:41,320
reason and that's why I love punk rock
 

6025
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:43,470
reason and that's why I love punk rock
exactly I mean there's something in

6026
01:59:43,470 --> 01:59:43,480
exactly I mean there's something in
 

6027
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:45,709
exactly I mean there's something in
humans that loves

6028
01:59:45,709 --> 01:59:45,719
humans that loves
 

6029
01:59:45,719 --> 01:59:48,310
humans that loves
complaining even about trivial things

6030
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:48,320
complaining even about trivial things
 

6031
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:50,030
complaining even about trivial things
but uh complaining about change

6032
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:50,040
but uh complaining about change
 

6033
01:59:50,040 --> 01:59:52,310
but uh complaining about change
complaining about everything But

6034
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:52,320
complaining about everything But
 

6035
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:56,669
complaining about everything But
ultimately I think on net on every

6036
01:59:56,669 --> 01:59:56,679
ultimately I think on net on every
 

6037
01:59:56,679 --> 01:59:59,430
ultimately I think on net on every
measure uh things are getting better

6038
01:59:59,430 --> 01:59:59,440
measure uh things are getting better
 

6039
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:01,550
measure uh things are getting better
life is getting better oh life is

6040
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:01,560
life is getting better oh life is
 

6041
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:02,709
life is getting better oh life is
getting better but I don't know

6042
02:00:02,709 --> 02:00:02,719
getting better but I don't know
 

6043
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:04,510
getting better but I don't know
necessarily that tracks people's

6044
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:04,520
necessarily that tracks people's
 

6045
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:06,870
necessarily that tracks people's
happiness right I mean I would argue

6046
02:00:06,870 --> 02:00:06,880
happiness right I mean I would argue
 

6047
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:09,189
happiness right I mean I would argue
that maybe who knows I don't know this

6048
02:00:09,189 --> 02:00:09,199
that maybe who knows I don't know this
 

6049
02:00:09,199 --> 02:00:10,669
that maybe who knows I don't know this
but I wouldn't be surprised if people in

6050
02:00:10,669 --> 02:00:10,679
but I wouldn't be surprised if people in
 

6051
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:12,149
but I wouldn't be surprised if people in
hunter gatherer

6052
02:00:12,149 --> 02:00:12,159
hunter gatherer
 

6053
02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:14,870
hunter gatherer
societies are happier I mean I wouldn't

6054
02:00:14,870 --> 02:00:14,880
societies are happier I mean I wouldn't
 

6055
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:16,510
societies are happier I mean I wouldn't
be surprised if they're happier than

6056
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:16,520
be surprised if they're happier than
 

6057
02:00:16,520 --> 02:00:19,189
be surprised if they're happier than
people who have access to modern

6058
02:00:19,189 --> 02:00:19,199
people who have access to modern
 

6059
02:00:19,199 --> 02:00:23,350
people who have access to modern
medicine and email and so phones well I

you look at like things like
 

6135

and it's like you're kind of you
 

6155
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:18,589
and it's like you're kind of you
probably don't even kind of get excited

6156
02:02:18,589 --> 02:02:18,599
probably don't even kind of get excited
 

6157
02:02:18,599 --> 02:02:20,350
probably don't even kind of get excited
about it when you get the paycheck but

6158
02:02:20,350 --> 02:02:20,360
about it when you get the paycheck but
 

6159
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:21,629
about it when you get the paycheck but
if they cut your salary you're going to

good I got a Bonus you know and that
 

6165
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:30,430
good I got a Bonus you know and that
adaptation and that ability that

6166
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:30,440
adaptation and that ability that
 

6167
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:33,430
adaptation and that ability that
basically you learn to expect these

6168
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:33,440
basically you learn to expect these
 

6169
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:37,350
basically you learn to expect these
things I think is a major source of I

things I think is a major source of I
 

6171
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:39,589
things I think is a major source of I
guess it's a major way in which we're

6172
02:02:39,589 --> 02:02:39,599
guess it's a major way in which we're
 

6173
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:42,669
guess it's a major way in which we're
kind of more in my opinion wired to

6174
02:02:42,669 --> 02:02:42,679
kind of more in my opinion wired to
 

6175
02:02:42,679 --> 02:02:45,709
kind of more in my opinion wired to
strive and not be happy to be in a state

6176
02:02:45,709 --> 02:02:45,719
strive and not be happy to be in a state
 

6177
02:02:45,719 --> 02:02:47,350
strive and not be happy to be in a state
of wanting and if you know so people

6178
02:02:47,350 --> 02:02:47,360
of wanting and if you know so people
 

6179
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,030
of wanting and if you know so people
talk about dopamine for instance being

6180
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:49,040
talk about dopamine for instance being
 

6181
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:51,270
talk about dopamine for instance being
this pleasure chemical and it's like

6182
02:02:51,270 --> 02:02:51,280
this pleasure chemical and it's like
 

6183
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,350
this pleasure chemical and it's like
there's like lot of compelling research

6184
02:02:53,350 --> 02:02:53,360
there's like lot of compelling research
 

6185
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:56,229
there's like lot of compelling research
to suggest it's not about pleasure at

6186
02:02:56,229 --> 02:02:56,239
to suggest it's not about pleasure at
 

6187
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:59,910
to suggest it's not about pleasure at
all it's about the discomfort that

6188
02:02:59,910 --> 02:02:59,920
all it's about the discomfort that
 

6189
02:02:59,920 --> 02:03:03,510
all it's about the discomfort that
energizes you to get things to seek a

6190
02:03:03,510 --> 02:03:03,520
energizes you to get things to seek a
 

6191
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:05,750
energizes you to get things to seek a
reward right and so you could give an

6192
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:05,760
reward right and so you could give an
 

6193
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:07,910
reward right and so you could give an
animal that's been deprived of dopamine

6194
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:07,920
animal that's been deprived of dopamine
 

6195
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:10,510
animal that's been deprived of dopamine
a reward and oh yeah I enjoy it it's

6196
02:03:10,510 --> 02:03:10,520
a reward and oh yeah I enjoy it it's
 

6197
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,709
a reward and oh yeah I enjoy it it's
pretty good but they're not going to do

6198
02:03:12,709 --> 02:03:12,719
pretty good but they're not going to do
 

6199
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:16,270
pretty good but they're not going to do
anything to get it you know and uh just

6200
02:03:16,270 --> 02:03:16,280
anything to get it you know and uh just
 

6201
02:03:16,280 --> 02:03:17,390
anything to get it you know and uh just
one of the weird things in our

6202
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:17,400
one of the weird things in our
 

6203
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:20,629
one of the weird things in our
researches Is We I got into curiosity

6204
02:03:20,629 --> 02:03:20,639

6207
02:03:23,840 --> 02:03:25,830
from a postto in my lab matius Gruber
and one of the things that we found is

6208
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:25,840
and one of the things that we found is
 

6209
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:28,990
and one of the things that we found is
when we gave people a question like uh a

6210
02:03:28,990 --> 02:03:29,000
when we gave people a question like uh a
 

6211
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:30,550
when we gave people a question like uh a
trivia question that they wanted the

trivia question that they wanted the
 

6213
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:33,870

answer to the question the more Curious
 

6215
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:35,790
answer to the question the more Curious
people were about the answer the more

6216
02:03:35,790 --> 02:03:35,800
people were about the answer the more
 

6217
02:03:35,800 --> 02:03:37,910
people were about the answer the more
activity in these dopamine related

6218
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:37,920
activity in these dopamine related
 

6219
02:03:37,920 --> 02:03:40,750
activity in these dopamine related
circuits in the brain we would see um

6220
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:40,760
circuits in the brain we would see um
 

6221
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:42,310
circuits in the brain we would see um
and again that was not driven by the

6222
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:42,320
and again that was not driven by the
 

6223
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,350
and again that was not driven by the
answer per se but by the question so it

6224
02:03:45,350 --> 02:03:45,360
answer per se but by the question so it
 

6225
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,430
answer per se but by the question so it
was not about getting the information it

6226
02:03:47,430 --> 02:03:47,440
was not about getting the information it
 

6227
02:03:47,440 --> 02:03:50,270
was not about getting the information it
was about the drive to seek the

6228
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,280
was about the drive to seek the
 

6229
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,990
was about the drive to seek the
information um but but it depends on how

6230
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:53,000
information um but but it depends on how
 

6231
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,350
information um but but it depends on how
you take that if you get this

6232
02:03:54,350 --> 02:03:54,360
you take that if you get this
 

6233
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:57,390
you take that if you get this
uncomfortable gap between what you know

6234
02:03:57,390 --> 02:03:57,400
uncomfortable gap between what you know
 

6235
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:59,069
uncomfortable gap between what you know
and what you want to know you could

6236
02:03:59,069 --> 02:03:59,079
and what you want to know you could
 

6237
02:03:59,079 --> 02:04:00,870
and what you want to know you could
either use that to motivate you and

6238
02:04:00,870 --> 02:04:00,880
either use that to motivate you and
 

6239
02:04:00,880 --> 02:04:03,390
either use that to motivate you and
energize you or you could use it to say

6240
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:03,400
energize you or you could use it to say
 

6241
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:04,830
energize you or you could use it to say
I don't want to hear about this this

Through Torture you

6300
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:15,480
Through Torture you
 

6301
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:18,149
Through Torture you
can make people say anything and

6302
02:05:18,149 --> 02:05:18,159
can make people say anything and
 

6303
02:05:18,159 --> 02:05:20,830
can make people say anything and
essentially remember anything I wonder

6304
02:05:20,830 --> 02:05:20,840
essentially remember anything I wonder
 

6305
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:22,270
essentially remember anything I wonder
to which degree there's like truth to

6306
02:05:22,270 --> 02:05:22,280
to which degree there's like truth to
 

6307
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:24,549
to which degree there's like truth to
that if you look at the torture that

6308
02:05:24,549 --> 02:05:24,559
that if you look at the torture that
 

6309
02:05:24,559 --> 02:05:26,189
that if you look at the torture that
happened in the Soviet Union to for

6310
02:05:26,189 --> 02:05:26,199
happened in the Soviet Union to for
 

6311
02:05:26,199 --> 02:05:28,470
happened in the Soviet Union to for
confessions all that kind of stuff how

6312
02:05:28,470 --> 02:05:28,480
confessions all that kind of stuff how
 

6313
02:05:28,480 --> 02:05:31,830
confessions all that kind of stuff how
much can you really get people to

6314
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:31,840
much can you really get people to
 

6315
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:35,350
much can you really get people to
really yeah to force false memories I

6316
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:35,360
really yeah to force false memories I
 

6317
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:38,709
really yeah to force false memories I
guess yeah I mean I think uh um there's

6318
02:05:38,709 --> 02:05:38,719
guess yeah I mean I think uh um there's
 

6319
02:05:38,719 --> 02:05:41,709
guess yeah I mean I think uh um there's
a lot of history of this actually in uh

6320
02:05:41,709 --> 02:05:41,719
a lot of history of this actually in uh
 

6321
02:05:41,719 --> 02:05:44,189
a lot of history of this actually in uh
the criminal justice system uh you might

6322
02:05:44,189 --> 02:05:44,199
the criminal justice system uh you might
 

6323
02:05:44,199 --> 02:05:46,830
the criminal justice system uh you might
have heard the term the third degree if

6324
02:05:46,830 --> 02:05:46,840
have heard the term the third degree if
 

6325
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:49,189
have heard the term the third degree if
you actually look it up historically it

6326
02:05:49,189 --> 02:05:49,199
you actually look it up historically it
 

6327
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:52,549
you actually look it up historically it
was a very intense set of eatings and

6328
02:05:52,549 --> 02:05:52,559
was a very intense set of eatings and
 

6329
02:05:52,559 --> 02:05:54,709
was a very intense set of eatings and
you know starvation and

6330
02:05:54,709 --> 02:05:54,719
you know starvation and
 

6331
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:56,910
you know starvation and
physical uh demands that they would

6332
02:05:56,910 --> 02:05:56,920
physical uh demands that they would
 

6333
02:05:56,920 --> 02:05:59,950
physical uh demands that they would
place on people to get them to talk and

6334
02:05:59,950 --> 02:05:59,960
place on people to get them to talk and
 

6335
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:01,629
place on people to get them to talk and
you know there's certainly a lot of work

6336
02:06:01,629 --> 02:06:01,639
you know there's certainly a lot of work
 

6337
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:04,149
you know there's certainly a lot of work
in the that's been done by the CIA in

6338
02:06:04,149 --> 02:06:04,159
in the that's been done by the CIA in
 

6339
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:06,390
in the that's been done by the CIA in
terms of enhanced ter interrogation

6340
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:06,400
terms of enhanced ter interrogation
 

6341
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:09,950
terms of enhanced ter interrogation
techniques and from what I understand

6342
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:09,960
techniques and from what I understand
 

6343
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:11,629
techniques and from what I understand
the the research actually shows that

6344
02:06:11,629 --> 02:06:11,639
the the research actually shows that
 

6345
02:06:11,639 --> 02:06:14,470
the the research actually shows that
they just produce what people want to

6346
02:06:14,470 --> 02:06:14,480
they just produce what people want to
 

6347
02:06:14,480 --> 02:06:17,589
they just produce what people want to
hear not necessarily the the information

6348
02:06:17,589 --> 02:06:17,599
hear not necessarily the the information
 

6349
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:19,390
hear not necessarily the the information
that that is being looked for and the

6350
02:06:19,390 --> 02:06:19,400
that that is being looked for and the
 

6351
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:21,830
that that is being looked for and the
reason is is that I mean there's

6352
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:21,840
reason is is that I mean there's
 

6353
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,629
reason is is that I mean there's
different reasons I mean one is people

6354
02:06:23,629 --> 02:06:23,639
different reasons I mean one is people
 

6355
02:06:23,639 --> 02:06:25,030
different reasons I mean one is people
just get tired of being tortured and

6356
02:06:25,030 --> 02:06:25,040
just get tired of being tortured and
 

6357
02:06:25,040 --> 02:06:27,709
just get tired of being tortured and
just say whatever but uh another part of

6358
02:06:27,709 --> 02:06:27,719
just say whatever but uh another part of
 

6359
02:06:27,719 --> 02:06:30,390
just say whatever but uh another part of
it is is that you create a very

6360
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:30,400
it is is that you create a very
 

6361
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,390
it is is that you create a very
interesting set of conditions where

6362
02:06:32,390 --> 02:06:32,400
interesting set of conditions where
 

6363
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:35,430
interesting set of conditions where
there's an authority figure telling you

6364
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:35,440
there's an authority figure telling you
 

6365
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:37,229
there's an authority figure telling you
something that you did this we know you

6366
02:06:37,229 --> 02:06:37,239
something that you did this we know you
 

6367
02:06:37,239 --> 02:06:38,750
something that you did this we know you
did this we have witnesses saying you

6368
02:06:38,750 --> 02:06:38,760
did this we have witnesses saying you
 

6369
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:41,149
did this we have witnesses saying you
did this so now you start to question

6370
02:06:41,149 --> 02:06:41,159
did this so now you start to question
 

6371
02:06:41,159 --> 02:06:44,030
did this so now you start to question
yourself then they put you under stress

6372
02:06:44,030 --> 02:06:44,040
yourself then they put you under stress
 

6373
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:46,310
yourself then they put you under stress
maybe they're not feeding you maybe

6374
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,320
maybe they're not feeding you maybe
 

6375
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:48,229
maybe they're not feeding you maybe
they're kind of like making you be cold

6376
02:06:48,229 --> 02:06:48,239
they're kind of like making you be cold
 

6377
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:51,589
they're kind of like making you be cold
or you know exposing you to like uh

6378
02:06:51,589 --> 02:06:51,599
or you know exposing you to like uh
 

6379
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:53,229
or you know exposing you to like uh
music that you can't stand or something

6380
02:06:53,229 --> 02:06:53,239
music that you can't stand or something
 

6381
02:06:53,239 --> 02:06:55,470
music that you can't stand or something
whatever it is right it's like they're

6382
02:06:55,470 --> 02:06:55,480
whatever it is right it's like they're
 

6383
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:58,390
whatever it is right it's like they're
they're creating this physical stress

6384
02:06:58,390 --> 02:06:58,400
they're creating this physical stress
 

6385
02:06:58,400 --> 02:07:01,470
they're creating this physical stress
and so stress starts to act on you know

6386
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:01,480
and so stress starts to act on you know
 

6387
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:03,310
and so stress starts to act on you know
starts to downregulate the prefrontal

6388
02:07:03,310 --> 02:07:03,320
starts to downregulate the prefrontal
 

6389
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,109
starts to downregulate the prefrontal
cortex you're not necessarily as good at

6390
02:07:05,109 --> 02:07:05,119
cortex you're not necessarily as good at
 

6391
02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:07,790
cortex you're not necessarily as good at
monitoring the accuracy of stuff then

6392
02:07:07,790 --> 02:07:07,800
monitoring the accuracy of stuff then
 

6393
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:09,149
monitoring the accuracy of stuff then
they start to get nice to you and they

6394
02:07:09,149 --> 02:07:09,159
they start to get nice to you and they
 

6395
02:07:09,159 --> 02:07:11,109
they start to get nice to you and they
say imagine you know okay I know you

6396
02:07:11,109 --> 02:07:11,119
say imagine you know okay I know you
 

6397
02:07:11,119 --> 02:07:12,950
say imagine you know okay I know you
don't remember this but maybe we can

6398
02:07:12,950 --> 02:07:12,960
don't remember this but maybe we can
 

6399
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,510
don't remember this but maybe we can
walk you through how it could have

6400
02:07:14,510 --> 02:07:14,520
walk you through how it could have
 

6401
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:16,270
walk you through how it could have
happened and they feed you the

6402
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:16,280
happened and they feed you the
 

6403
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:18,629
happened and they feed you the
information and so you're in this

6404
02:07:18,629 --> 02:07:18,639
information and so you're in this
 

6405
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:21,030
information and so you're in this
weakened mental state and you're being

6406
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:21,040
weakened mental state and you're being
 

6407
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,069
weakened mental state and you're being
encouraged to imagine things by people

6408
02:07:23,069 --> 02:07:23,079
encouraged to imagine things by people
 

6409
02:07:23,079 --> 02:07:25,990
encouraged to imagine things by people
who give you a plausible scenario and at

6410
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:26,000
who give you a plausible scenario and at
 

6411
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,910
who give you a plausible scenario and at
some point certain people can be very

something about attachment that's just

something about attachment that's just
 

6553

02:10:46,510 --> 02:10:46,520
sometimes it's also not just about the
 

6561
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,629
sometimes it's also not just about the
Heartbreak but about the positive

6562
02:10:48,629 --> 02:10:48,639
Heartbreak but about the positive
 

6563
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:51,629
Heartbreak but about the positive
aspects of it right cu the loss comes

6564
02:10:51,629 --> 02:10:51,639
aspects of it right cu the loss comes
 

6565
02:10:51,639 --> 02:10:54,430
aspects of it right cu the loss comes
from not only the fact that the

6566
02:10:54,430 --> 02:10:54,440
from not only the fact that the
 

6567
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:56,709
from not only the fact that the
relationship is over but you had all of

6568
02:10:56,709 --> 02:10:56,719
relationship is over but you had all of
 

6569
02:10:56,719 --> 02:10:59,470
relationship is over but you had all of
these good things before that you can

6570
02:10:59,470 --> 02:10:59,480
these good things before that you can
 

6571

6573
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:05,589
now see in a new light right and so part
of one of the things that I found from

6574
02:11:05,589 --> 02:11:05,599
of one of the things that I found from
 

6575
02:11:05,599 --> 02:11:07,270
of one of the things that I found from
my clinical background that really I

02:11:07,270 --> 02:11:07,280
my clinical background that really I
 

6577
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:09,069
my clinical background that really I
think gave me a different perspective on

think gave me a different perspective on
 

6579

think gave me a different perspective on
memory is so much of the therapy process

or at least some strains of Hinduism and

Hinduism uh like if you read the bhat

6770
02:15:05,589 --> 02:15:05,599
Hinduism uh like if you read the bhat
 

6771
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:09,709
Hinduism uh like if you read the bhat
Gita the philosophy is not one of

6772
02:15:09,709 --> 02:15:09,719
Gita the philosophy is not one of
 

6773
02:15:09,719 --> 02:15:12,270
Gita the philosophy is not one of
renouncing the world because the idea is

6774
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:12,280
renouncing the world because the idea is
 

6775
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:15,390
renouncing the world because the idea is
is that not doing something is no

6776
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:15,400
is that not doing something is no
 

6777
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:18,109
is that not doing something is no
different than doing something right so

6778
02:15:18,109 --> 02:15:18,119
different than doing something right so
 

6779
02:15:18,119 --> 02:15:20,069
different than doing something right so
um what they argue and again you could

6780
02:15:20,069 --> 02:15:20,079
um what they argue and again you could
 

6781
02:15:20,079 --> 02:15:21,669
um what they argue and again you could
interpret in different positive and

6782
02:15:21,669 --> 02:15:21,679
interpret in different positive and
 

6783
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:24,470
interpret in different positive and
negative but the argument is is that you

6784
02:15:24,470 --> 02:15:24,480
negative but the argument is is that you
 

6785
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:27,030
negative but the argument is is that you
don't want to renounce action but you

6786
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:27,040
don't want to renounce action but you
 

6787
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:28,910
don't want to renounce action but you
want to renounce the fruits of the

6788
02:15:28,910 --> 02:15:28,920
want to renounce the fruits of the
 

6789
02:15:28,920 --> 02:15:31,830
want to renounce the fruits of the
action you don't do it because of the

6790
02:15:31,830 --> 02:15:31,840
action you don't do it because of the
 

6791
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,709
action you don't do it because of the
outcome you do it because of the process

6792
02:15:34,709 --> 02:15:34,719
outcome you do it because of the process
 

6793
02:15:34,719 --> 02:15:36,790
outcome you do it because of the process
because the process is part of the

6794
02:15:36,790 --> 02:15:36,800
because the process is part of the
 

6795
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:38,350
because the process is part of the
balance of the world that you're trying

balance of the world that you're trying

6801
02:15:42,440 --> 02:15:44,069

Thera uh how does study memory affect
your understanding of the nature of time

6834
02:16:23,950 --> 02:16:23,960
your understanding of the nature of time
 

6835
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:28,109
your understanding of the nature of time
so like we've been talking about us

6836
02:16:28,109 --> 02:16:28,119
so like we've been talking about us
 

6837
02:16:28,119 --> 02:16:30,870
so like we've been talking about us
living in the the present and making

6838
02:16:30,870 --> 02:16:30,880
living in the the present and making
 

6839
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:32,429
living in the the present and making
decisions about the

6840
02:16:32,429 --> 02:16:32,439
decisions about the
 

6841
02:16:32,439 --> 02:16:35,070
decisions about the
future standing on the foundation of

6842
02:16:35,070 --> 02:16:35,080
future standing on the foundation of
 

6843
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:36,790
future standing on the foundation of
these memories and narratives about the

6844
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:36,800
these memories and narratives about the
 

6845
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:38,950
these memories and narratives about the
memories that we've constructed so it

6846
02:16:38,950 --> 02:16:38,960
memories that we've constructed so it
 

6847
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:40,110
memories that we've constructed so it
feels

6848
02:16:40,110 --> 02:16:40,120
feels
 

6849
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:43,950
feels
like it does weird things to time yeah

6850
02:16:43,950 --> 02:16:43,960
like it does weird things to time yeah
 

6851
02:16:43,960 --> 02:16:46,549
like it does weird things to time yeah
and the reason is is that in some sense

6852
02:16:46,549 --> 02:16:46,559
and the reason is is that in some sense
 

6853
02:16:46,559 --> 02:16:48,750
and the reason is is that in some sense
I think especially the farther we go

6854
02:16:48,750 --> 02:16:48,760
I think especially the farther we go
 

6855
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:50,389
I think especially the farther we go
back I mean there's all sorts of

6856
02:16:50,389 --> 02:16:50,399
back I mean there's all sorts of
 

6857
02:16:50,399 --> 02:16:53,150
back I mean there's all sorts of
interesting things that happen so your

6858
02:16:53,150 --> 02:16:53,160
interesting things that happen so your
 

6859
02:16:53,160 --> 02:16:56,030
interesting things that happen so your
sense of like if I ask you how different

6860
02:16:56,030 --> 02:16:56,040
sense of like if I ask you how different
 

6861
02:16:56,040 --> 02:16:59,190
sense of like if I ask you how different
does one hour ago feel from two hours

6862
02:16:59,190 --> 02:16:59,200
does one hour ago feel from two hours
 

6863
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:01,870
does one hour ago feel from two hours
ago you'd probably say pretty different

6864
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:01,880
ago you'd probably say pretty different
 

6865
02:17:01,880 --> 02:17:04,190
ago you'd probably say pretty different
but if I ask you okay go back one year

6866
02:17:04,190 --> 02:17:04,200
but if I ask you okay go back one year
 

6867
02:17:04,200 --> 02:17:06,469
but if I ask you okay go back one year
ago versus one year and 1 hour ago it's

6868
02:17:06,469 --> 02:17:06,479
ago versus one year and 1 hour ago it's
 

6869
02:17:06,479 --> 02:17:08,150
ago versus one year and 1 hour ago it's
the same difference in time it won't

6870
02:17:08,150 --> 02:17:08,160
the same difference in time it won't
 

6871
02:17:08,160 --> 02:17:09,629
the same difference in time it won't
feel very different right so there's

6872
02:17:09,629 --> 02:17:09,639
feel very different right so there's
 

6873
02:17:09,639 --> 02:17:12,030
feel very different right so there's
this kind of compression that happens as

6874
02:17:12,030 --> 02:17:12,040
this kind of compression that happens as
 

6875
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:15,270
this kind of compression that happens as
you look back F farther in time so that

6876
02:17:15,270 --> 02:17:15,280
you look back F farther in time so that
 

6877
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:17,429
you look back F farther in time so that
it's kind of like why when you're older

6878
02:17:17,429 --> 02:17:17,439
it's kind of like why when you're older
 

6879
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:19,230
it's kind of like why when you're older
the difference between somebody who's

6880
02:17:19,230 --> 02:17:19,240
the difference between somebody who's
 

6881
02:17:19,240 --> 02:17:22,589
the difference between somebody who's
like 50 and you know 45 doesn't seem as

6882
02:17:22,589 --> 02:17:22,599
like 50 and you know 45 doesn't seem as
 

6883
02:17:22,599 --> 02:17:23,950
like 50 and you know 45 doesn't seem as
big as the difference between like 10

6884
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:23,960
big as the difference between like 10
 

6885
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:25,389
big as the difference between like 10
and five or something right when you're

6886
02:17:25,389 --> 02:17:25,399
and five or something right when you're
 

6887
02:17:25,399 --> 02:17:27,589
and five or something right when you're
10 years old everything seems like it's

6888
02:17:27,589 --> 02:17:27,599
10 years old everything seems like it's
 

6889
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:29,910
10 years old everything seems like it's
a long period of time here's the point

6890
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:29,920
a long period of time here's the point
 

6891
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:31,349
a long period of time here's the point
is that you know so one of the

6892
02:17:31,349 --> 02:17:31,359
is that you know so one of the
 

6893
02:17:31,359 --> 02:17:33,150
is that you know so one of the
interesting things that I found when I

6894
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:33,160
interesting things that I found when I
 

6895
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:34,509
interesting things that I found when I
was working on the book actually was

6896
02:17:34,509 --> 02:17:34,519
was working on the book actually was
 

6897
02:17:34,519 --> 02:17:37,509
was working on the book actually was
during the pandemic I just decided to

6898
02:17:37,509 --> 02:17:37,519
during the pandemic I just decided to
 

6899
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:38,950
during the pandemic I just decided to
ask people in my class when we were

6900
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:38,960
ask people in my class when we were
 

6901
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:41,190
ask people in my class when we were
doing the remote instruction so one of

6902
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:41,200
doing the remote instruction so one of
 

6903
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,750
doing the remote instruction so one of
the things I did was I would pull people

6904
02:17:42,750 --> 02:17:42,760
the things I did was I would pull people
 

6905
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:45,230
the things I did was I would pull people
and so I just asked people do you feel

6906
02:17:45,230 --> 02:17:45,240
and so I just asked people do you feel
 

6907
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:48,549
and so I just asked people do you feel
like the days are moving by slower or

6908
02:17:48,549 --> 02:17:48,559
like the days are moving by slower or
 

6909
02:17:48,559 --> 02:17:52,110
like the days are moving by slower or
faster or about the same almost everyone

6910
02:17:52,110 --> 02:17:52,120
faster or about the same almost everyone
 

6911
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:53,509
faster or about the same almost everyone
in the class said that the days were

6912
02:17:53,509 --> 02:17:53,519
in the class said that the days were
 

6913
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:57,070
in the class said that the days were
moving by slower um so then at the I

6914
02:17:57,070 --> 02:17:57,080
moving by slower um so then at the I
 

6915
02:17:57,080 --> 02:17:59,190
moving by slower um so then at the I
would say okay so do you feel like the

6916
02:17:59,190 --> 02:17:59,200
would say okay so do you feel like the
 

6917
02:17:59,200 --> 02:18:01,790
would say okay so do you feel like the
weeks are passing by slower faster or

6918
02:18:01,790 --> 02:18:01,800
weeks are passing by slower faster or
 

6919
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:04,070
weeks are passing by slower faster or
the same and the majority of them said

6920
02:18:04,070 --> 02:18:04,080
the same and the majority of them said
 

6921
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:07,389
the same and the majority of them said
that the weeks were passing by faster so

6922
02:18:07,389 --> 02:18:07,399
that the weeks were passing by faster so
 

6923
02:18:07,399 --> 02:18:09,070
that the weeks were passing by faster so
according to the laws of physics I don't

6924
02:18:09,070 --> 02:18:09,080
according to the laws of physics I don't
 

6925
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:11,629
according to the laws of physics I don't
think that makes any sense right yeah

6926
02:18:11,629 --> 02:18:11,639
think that makes any sense right yeah
 

6927
02:18:11,639 --> 02:18:14,190
think that makes any sense right yeah
but according to memory it did because

6928
02:18:14,190 --> 02:18:14,200
but according to memory it did because
 

6929
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:15,950
but according to memory it did because
what happened was people were doing the

6930
02:18:15,950 --> 02:18:15,960
what happened was people were doing the
 

6931
02:18:15,960 --> 02:18:18,309
what happened was people were doing the
same thing over and over in the same

6932
02:18:18,309 --> 02:18:18,319
same thing over and over in the same
 

6933
02:18:18,319 --> 02:18:21,230
same thing over and over in the same
context and without that change in

6934
02:18:21,230 --> 02:18:21,240
context and without that change in
 

6935
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:24,910
context and without that change in
context their feeling was that they were

6936
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:24,920
context their feeling was that they were
 

6937
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:29,389
context their feeling was that they were
in one long monotonous event and so but

6938
02:18:29,389 --> 02:18:29,399
in one long monotonous event and so but
 

6939
02:18:29,399 --> 02:18:30,830
in one long monotonous event and so but
then at the end of the week you look

6940
02:18:30,830 --> 02:18:30,840
then at the end of the week you look
 

6941
02:18:30,840 --> 02:18:32,750
then at the end of the week you look
back at that week and you say well what

6942
02:18:32,750 --> 02:18:32,760
back at that week and you say well what
 

6943
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:34,629
back at that week and you say well what
happened have no memories of what

6944
02:18:34,629 --> 02:18:34,639
happened have no memories of what
 

6945
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:37,349
happened have no memories of what
happened so it must the week just went

6946
02:18:37,349 --> 02:18:37,359
happened so it must the week just went
 

6947
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:39,750
happened so it must the week just went
by without even my noticing it but that

6948
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:39,760
by without even my noticing it but that
 

6949
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:42,429
by without even my noticing it but that
week went by during the same amount of

6950
02:18:42,429 --> 02:18:42,439
week went by during the same amount of
 

6951
02:18:42,439 --> 02:18:44,190
week went by during the same amount of
time as an eventful week where you might

6952
02:18:44,190 --> 02:18:44,200
time as an eventful week where you might
 

6953
02:18:44,200 --> 02:18:45,549
time as an eventful week where you might
have been going out hanging out with

6954
02:18:45,549 --> 02:18:45,559
have been going out hanging out with
 

6955
02:18:45,559 --> 02:18:48,030
have been going out hanging out with
friends on vacation or whatever right

6956
02:18:48,030 --> 02:18:48,040
friends on vacation or whatever right
 

6957
02:18:48,040 --> 02:18:50,389
friends on vacation or whatever right
it's just that nothing happened because

6958
02:18:50,389 --> 02:18:50,399
it's just that nothing happened because
 

6959
02:18:50,399 --> 02:18:51,910
it's just that nothing happened because
you're doing the same thing over and

6960
02:18:51,910 --> 02:18:51,920
you're doing the same thing over and
 

6961
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:54,509
you're doing the same thing over and
over so I feel like memory really shapes

6962
02:18:54,509 --> 02:18:54,519
over so I feel like memory really shapes
 

6963
02:18:54,519 --> 02:18:58,190
over so I feel like memory really shapes
our sense of time but it does so in part

6964
02:18:58,190 --> 02:18:58,200
our sense of time but it does so in part
 

6965
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:00,469
our sense of time but it does so in part
because context is so important for

6966
02:19:00,469 --> 02:19:00,479
because context is so important for
 

6967
02:19:00,479 --> 02:19:02,950
because context is so important for
memory well that compression you

6968
02:19:02,950 --> 02:19:02,960
memory well that compression you
 

6969
02:19:02,960 --> 02:19:05,629
memory well that compression you
mentioned it's an interesting process

6970
02:19:05,629 --> 02:19:05,639
mentioned it's an interesting process
 

6971
02:19:05,639 --> 02:19:07,070
mentioned it's an interesting process
because when I think about when I was

6972
02:19:07,070 --> 02:19:07,080
because when I think about when I was
 

6973
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:10,750
because when I think about when I was
like 12 or

6974
02:19:10,750 --> 02:19:10,760
like 12 or
 

6975
02:19:10,760 --> 02:19:13,669
like 12 or
15 I just fundamentally feel like the

6976
02:19:13,669 --> 02:19:13,679
15 I just fundamentally feel like the
 

6977
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:16,190
15 I just fundamentally feel like the
same person it's interesting what that

6978
02:19:16,190 --> 02:19:16,200
same person it's interesting what that
 

6979
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:18,030
same person it's interesting what that
compression does it makes me feel like

6980
02:19:18,030 --> 02:19:18,040
compression does it makes me feel like
 

6981
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:20,309
compression does it makes me feel like
it's all we're all connected not just

6982
02:19:20,309 --> 02:19:20,319
it's all we're all connected not just
 

6983
02:19:20,319 --> 02:19:23,070
it's all we're all connected not just
amongst humans and spatially but in

6984
02:19:23,070 --> 02:19:23,080
amongst humans and spatially but in
 

6985
02:19:23,080 --> 02:19:26,910
amongst humans and spatially but in
terms in back in time there's a kind

6986
02:19:26,910 --> 02:19:26,920
terms in back in time there's a kind
 

6987
02:19:26,920 --> 02:19:29,709
terms in back in time there's a kind
of uh Eternal nature like the

6988
02:19:29,709 --> 02:19:29,719
of uh Eternal nature like the
 

6989
02:19:29,719 --> 02:19:32,509
of uh Eternal nature like the
timelessness I guess mhm to life that

6990
02:19:32,509 --> 02:19:32,519
timelessness I guess mhm to life that
 

6991
02:19:32,519 --> 02:19:34,230
timelessness I guess mhm to life that
could be also a genetic thing just for

6992
02:19:34,230 --> 02:19:34,240
could be also a genetic thing just for
 

6993
02:19:34,240 --> 02:19:36,950
could be also a genetic thing just for
for me I don't know if everyone agrees

6994
02:19:36,950 --> 02:19:36,960
for me I don't know if everyone agrees
 

6995
02:19:36,960 --> 02:19:39,190
for me I don't know if everyone agrees
to this view of time but to me it all

6996
02:19:39,190 --> 02:19:39,200
to this view of time but to me it all
 

6997
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:41,349
to this view of time but to me it all
feels the same like you don't feel the

6998
02:19:41,349 --> 02:19:41,359
feels the same like you don't feel the
 

6999
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:43,870
feels the same like you don't feel the
passage of time or no I feel the passage

7000
02:19:43,870 --> 02:19:43,880
passage of time or no I feel the passage
 

7001
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:46,110
passage of time or no I feel the passage
of time the same way the students did

7002
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:46,120
of time the same way the students did
 

7003
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:49,389
of time the same way the students did
from day to day mhm there's certain

7004
02:19:49,389 --> 02:19:49,399
from day to day mhm there's certain
 

7005
02:19:49,399 --> 02:19:52,349
from day to day mhm there's certain
markers uh that let you know that time

7006
02:19:52,349 --> 02:19:52,359
markers uh that let you know that time
 

7007
02:19:52,359 --> 02:19:54,349
markers uh that let you know that time
has passed you celebrate birdes and so

7008
02:19:54,349 --> 02:19:54,359
has passed you celebrate birdes and so
 

7009
02:19:54,359 --> 02:19:57,469
has passed you celebrate birdes and so
on but the core of who I am and who

7010
02:19:57,469 --> 02:19:57,479
on but the core of who I am and who
 

7011
02:19:57,479 --> 02:20:00,870
on but the core of who I am and who
others I know are or events it like that

7012
02:20:00,870 --> 02:20:00,880
others I know are or events it like that
 

7013
02:20:00,880 --> 02:20:02,590
others I know are or events it like that
compression of my understanding of the

7014
02:20:02,590 --> 02:20:02,600
compression of my understanding of the
 

7015
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:06,990
compression of my understanding of the
world okay removes time cuz time is not

7016
02:20:06,990 --> 02:20:07,000
world okay removes time cuz time is not
 

7017
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,870
world okay removes time cuz time is not
useful for the compression so like the

7018
02:20:08,870 --> 02:20:08,880
useful for the compression so like the
 

7019
02:20:08,880 --> 02:20:11,270
useful for the compression so like the
details of that time at least for me is

7020
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:11,280
details of that time at least for me is
 

7021
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:13,590
details of that time at least for me is
not useful to understanding the core of

7022
02:20:13,590 --> 02:20:13,600
not useful to understanding the core of
 

7023
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:16,830
not useful to understanding the core of
the thing so maybe what it is is that

7024
02:20:16,830 --> 02:20:16,840
the thing so maybe what it is is that
 

7025
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:19,110
the thing so maybe what it is is that
you really like to see connections

7026
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:19,120
you really like to see connections
 

7027
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:21,070
you really like to see connections
between things this is like really what

7028
02:20:21,070 --> 02:20:21,080
between things this is like really what
 

7029
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:23,590
between things this is like really what
motivates me in science actually too but

7030
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:23,600
motivates me in science actually too but
 

7031
02:20:23,600 --> 02:20:25,590
motivates me in science actually too but
it's like when you start recalling the

7032
02:20:25,590 --> 02:20:25,600
it's like when you start recalling the
 

7033
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:28,070
it's like when you start recalling the
past to you know and seeing the

7034
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:28,080
past to you know and seeing the
 

7035
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:30,710
past to you know and seeing the
connections between the past and present

7036
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:30,720
connections between the past and present
 

7037
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:33,070
connections between the past and present
now you have this kind of web of

7038
02:20:33,070 --> 02:20:33,080
now you have this kind of web of
 

7039
02:20:33,080 --> 02:20:36,990
now you have this kind of web of
interconnected memories right and so I

7040
02:20:36,990 --> 02:20:37,000
interconnected memories right and so I
 

7041
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,230
interconnected memories right and so I
can imagine in that sense there is this

7042
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:39,240
can imagine in that sense there is this
 

7043
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:42,309
can imagine in that sense there is this
kind of the present is with you right um

7044
02:20:42,309 --> 02:20:42,319
kind of the present is with you right um
 

7045
02:20:42,319 --> 02:20:43,830
kind of the present is with you right um
but what's interesting about what you

7046
02:20:43,830 --> 02:20:43,840
but what's interesting about what you
 

7047
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:47,150
but what's interesting about what you
said too that struck me is that your

7048
02:20:47,150 --> 02:20:47,160
said too that struck me is that your
 

7049
02:20:47,160 --> 02:20:49,389
said too that struck me is that your
16-year-old self was probably very

7050
02:20:49,389 --> 02:20:49,399
16-year-old self was probably very
 

7051
02:20:49,399 --> 02:20:52,110
16-year-old self was probably very
complex you know and I'm by the way I'm

7052
02:20:52,110 --> 02:20:52,120
complex you know and I'm by the way I'm
 

7053
02:20:52,120 --> 02:20:53,870
complex you know and I'm by the way I'm
the same way but it's like it really is

7054
02:20:53,870 --> 02:20:53,880
the same way but it's like it really is
 

7055
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:56,190
the same way but it's like it really is
the source of a lot of Darkness for me

7056
02:20:56,190 --> 02:20:56,200
the source of a lot of Darkness for me
 

7057
02:20:56,200 --> 02:20:59,870
the source of a lot of Darkness for me
so but uh but when like you can look

7058
02:20:59,870 --> 02:20:59,880
so but uh but when like you can look
 

7059
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:03,429
so but uh but when like you can look
back at like let's say you hear a song

7060
02:21:03,429 --> 02:21:03,439
back at like let's say you hear a song
 

7061
02:21:03,439 --> 02:21:05,590
back at like let's say you hear a song
that you used to play like before you

7062
02:21:05,590 --> 02:21:05,600
that you used to play like before you
 

7063
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:07,630
that you used to play like before you
would go do a sports thing or something

7064
02:21:07,630 --> 02:21:07,640
would go do a sports thing or something
 

7065
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:08,590
would go do a sports thing or something
like that you might not think of

7066
02:21:08,590 --> 02:21:08,600
like that you might not think of
 

7067
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:10,630
like that you might not think of
yourself as an athlete but once you you

7068
02:21:10,630 --> 02:21:10,640
yourself as an athlete but once you you
 

7069
02:21:10,640 --> 02:21:12,670
yourself as an athlete but once you you
get back to that mental you mentally

7070
02:21:12,670 --> 02:21:12,680
get back to that mental you mentally
 

7071
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:14,870
get back to that mental you mentally
time travel to that particular thing you

7072
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:14,880
time travel to that particular thing you
 

7073
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,630
time travel to that particular thing you
open up this little compartment of

7074
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:16,640
open up this little compartment of
 

7075
02:21:16,640 --> 02:21:18,710
open up this little compartment of
yourself that wasn't there before right

7076
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:18,720
yourself that wasn't there before right
 

7077
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:21,190

Shaker's lab did this really cool study

7080
02:21:23,630 --> 02:21:23,640
Shaker's lab did this really cool study
 

7081
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:27,110
Shaker's lab did this really cool study
where they would ask people to either

7082

where they would ask people to either
 

7083
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:30,110
where they would ask people to either
remember doing something altruistic or

remember doing something altruistic or
 

7085
02:21:30,120 --> 02:21:33,550
remember doing something altruistic or
imagine doing something altruistic and

imagine doing something altruistic and
 

7087
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:37,469
imagine doing something altruistic and
that act made them more likely to want

02:21:37,469 --> 02:21:37,479
that act made them more likely to want
 

7089
02:21:37,479 --> 02:21:41,550
that act made them more likely to want
to do things for other people so that

7090
02:21:41,550 --> 02:21:41,560
to do things for other people so that
 

7091
02:21:41,560 --> 02:21:43,910
to do things for other people so that
act of mental time travel can change who

7092
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:43,920
act of mental time travel can change who
 

7093
02:21:43,920 --> 02:21:45,670
act of mental time travel can change who
you are in the present we tend to think

7094
02:21:45,670 --> 02:21:45,680
you are in the present we tend to think
 

7095
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:47,590
you are in the present we tend to think
of this goes back to that illusion of

7096
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:47,600
of this goes back to that illusion of
 

7097
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:50,349
of this goes back to that illusion of
stability and we tend to think of memory

7098
02:21:50,349 --> 02:21:50,359
stability and we tend to think of memory
 

7099
02:21:50,359 --> 02:21:52,550
stability and we tend to think of memory
this very deterministic way that I am

7100
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:52,560
this very deterministic way that I am
 

7101
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:54,990
this very deterministic way that I am
who I am because I have this past but we

who I am because I have this past but we
 

7103
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,750
who I am because I have this past but we
have a very multifaceted past and can

have a very multifaceted past and can
 

7105
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:01,910
have a very multifaceted past and can
access different parts of it and change

7106
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:01,920
access different parts of it and change
 

7107
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:04,150
access different parts of it and change
in the moment based on whatever part we

7142
02:22:50,670 --> 02:22:50,680
source of Happiness right um and being
 

7143
02:22:50,680 --> 02:22:52,590
source of Happiness right um and being
nostalgic can improve people's moods in

7144
02:22:52,590 --> 02:22:52,600
nostalgic can improve people's moods in
 

7145
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:55,750
nostalgic can improve people's moods in
the moment but it just depends on what

7146
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:55,760
the moment but it just depends on what
 

7147
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:57,830
the moment but it just depends on what
they do with it because what you can

7148
02:22:57,830 --> 02:22:57,840
they do with it because what you can
 

7149
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:00,070
they do with it because what you can
sometimes see is Nostalgia has the

7150
02:23:00,070 --> 02:23:00,080
sometimes see is Nostalgia has the
 

7151
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:01,790
sometimes see is Nostalgia has the
opposite effect of thinking those were

7152
02:23:01,790 --> 02:23:01,800
opposite effect of thinking those were
 

7153
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:03,349
opposite effect of thinking those were
the good old days and those days are

7154
02:23:03,349 --> 02:23:03,359
the good old days and those days are
 

7155
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:05,990
the good old days and those days are
over right it's like America used to be

7156
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,000
over right it's like America used to be
 

7157
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,790
over right it's like America used to be
so great and now it sucks or you know my

7158
02:23:08,790 --> 02:23:08,800
so great and now it sucks or you know my
 

7159
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,750
so great and now it sucks or you know my
life used to be so great when I was a

7160
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:10,760
life used to be so great when I was a
 

7161
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:13,790
life used to be so great when I was a
kid and now it's not right and you're

7162
02:23:13,790 --> 02:23:13,800
kid and now it's not right and you're
 

7163
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:15,910
kid and now it's not right and you're
selectively remembering the things

7164
02:23:15,910 --> 02:23:15,920
selectively remembering the things
 

7165
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:17,950
selectively remembering the things
thatan we don't realize how selective

7166
02:23:17,950 --> 02:23:17,960
thatan we don't realize how selective
 

7167
02:23:17,960 --> 02:23:21,230
thatan we don't realize how selective
our remembering self is and so you know

7168
02:23:21,230 --> 02:23:21,240
our remembering self is and so you know
 

7169
02:23:21,240 --> 02:23:23,510
our remembering self is and so you know
I live through the 70s it sucked you

7170
02:23:23,510 --> 02:23:23,520
I live through the 70s it sucked you
 

7171
02:23:23,520 --> 02:23:26,190
I live through the 70s it sucked you
know it's like uh partly it sucked more

7172
02:23:26,190 --> 02:23:26,200
know it's like uh partly it sucked more
 

7173
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:28,750
know it's like uh partly it sucked more
for me but I would say that even

7174
02:23:28,750 --> 02:23:28,760
for me but I would say that even
 

7175
02:23:28,760 --> 02:23:30,550
for me but I would say that even
otherwise it's like there's all sorts of

7176
02:23:30,550 --> 02:23:30,560
otherwise it's like there's all sorts of
 

7177
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:33,230
otherwise it's like there's all sorts of
problems going on gas lines people were

7178
02:23:33,230 --> 02:23:33,240
problems going on gas lines people were
 

7179
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:35,790
problems going on gas lines people were
like you know worried about like Russia

7180
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:35,800
like you know worried about like Russia
 

7181
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:38,790
like you know worried about like Russia
nuclear war blah blah blah so I mean

7182
02:23:38,790 --> 02:23:38,800
nuclear war blah blah blah so I mean
 

7183
02:23:38,800 --> 02:23:42,110
nuclear war blah blah blah so I mean
it's just this idea that people have

7184
02:23:42,110 --> 02:23:42,120
it's just this idea that people have
 

7185
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:45,510
it's just this idea that people have
about the past can be very useful if it

7186
02:23:45,510 --> 02:23:45,520
about the past can be very useful if it
 

7187
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:48,190
about the past can be very useful if it
brings you happiness in the present but

7188
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:48,200
brings you happiness in the present but
 

7189
02:23:48,200 --> 02:23:50,070
brings you happiness in the present but
if it Narrows your worldview in the

7190
02:23:50,070 --> 02:23:50,080
if it Narrows your worldview in the
 

7191
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:52,389
if it Narrows your worldview in the
present you're not aware of those biases

7192
02:23:52,389 --> 02:23:52,399
present you're not aware of those biases
 

7193
02:23:52,399 --> 02:23:55,349
present you're not aware of those biases
that you have you will end up you can

7194
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:55,359
that you have you will end up you can
 

7195
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:57,870
that you have you will end up you can
end up it can be toxic right either at a

7196
02:23:57,870 --> 02:23:57,880
end up it can be toxic right either at a
 

7197
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:00,990
end up it can be toxic right either at a
personal level or at a collective level

7198
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:01,000
personal level or at a collective level
 

7199
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,110
personal level or at a collective level
uh let me ask you both a practical

7200
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:03,120
uh let me ask you both a practical
 

7201
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:05,710
uh let me ask you both a practical
question and an out there question so

7202
02:24:05,710 --> 02:24:05,720
question and an out there question so
 

7203
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:07,510
question and an out there question so
let's start with a more practical one

7204
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:07,520
let's start with a more practical one
 

7205
02:24:07,520 --> 02:24:10,590
let's start with a more practical one
what what are your thoughts about um

7206
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:10,600
what what are your thoughts about um
 

7207
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:13,230
what what are your thoughts about um
bcis brain computer interfaces and the

7208
02:24:13,230 --> 02:24:13,240
bcis brain computer interfaces and the
 

7209
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:15,110
bcis brain computer interfaces and the
work that's going on with neur link We

7210
02:24:15,110 --> 02:24:15,120
work that's going on with neur link We
 

7211
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:17,110
work that's going on with neur link We
Lo we talked about electrod and

7212
02:24:17,110 --> 02:24:17,120
Lo we talked about electrod and
 

7213
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:18,830
Lo we talked about electrod and
different ways of measuring the brain

7214
02:24:18,830 --> 02:24:18,840
different ways of measuring the brain
 

7215
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:20,870
different ways of measuring the brain
and here neuralink is working on

7216
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:20,880
and here neuralink is working on
 

7217
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:22,349
and here neuralink is working on
basically two-way communication with the

7218
02:24:22,349 --> 02:24:22,359
basically two-way communication with the
 

7219
02:24:22,359 --> 02:24:23,950
basically two-way communication with the
brain and the more out there question

7220
02:24:23,950 --> 02:24:23,960
brain and the more out there question
 

7221
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:25,670
brain and the more out there question
would be like where does this go but

7222
02:24:25,670 --> 02:24:25,680
would be like where does this go but
 

7223
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:28,030
would be like where does this go but
more practically in the near term what

7224
02:24:28,030 --> 02:24:28,040
more practically in the near term what
 

7225
02:24:28,040 --> 02:24:30,750
more practically in the near term what
do you think about NE link yeah I mean I

7226
02:24:30,750 --> 02:24:30,760
do you think about NE link yeah I mean I
 

7227
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:32,670
do you think about NE link yeah I mean I
can't say specifics about the company

7228
02:24:32,670 --> 02:24:32,680
can't say specifics about the company
 

7229
02:24:32,680 --> 02:24:34,309
can't say specifics about the company
because I haven't studied it that much

7230
02:24:34,309 --> 02:24:34,319
because I haven't studied it that much
 

7231
02:24:34,319 --> 02:24:36,550
because I haven't studied it that much
but I mean I think there's two parts of

7232
02:24:36,550 --> 02:24:36,560
but I mean I think there's two parts of
 

7233
02:24:36,560 --> 02:24:38,030
but I mean I think there's two parts of
it so one is they're developing some

7234
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,040
it so one is they're developing some
 

7235
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:39,550
it so one is they're developing some
really interesting technology I think

7236
02:24:39,550 --> 02:24:39,560
really interesting technology I think
 

7237
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:41,990
really interesting technology I think
with these like s surgical robots and

7238
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:42,000
with these like s surgical robots and
 

7239
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,750
with these like s surgical robots and
things like that um BCI though has like

7240
02:24:45,750 --> 02:24:45,760
things like that um BCI though has like
 

7241
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:48,910
things like that um BCI though has like
a whole lot of innovation going on I I'm

7242
02:24:48,910 --> 02:24:48,920
a whole lot of innovation going on I I'm
 

7243
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:51,830
a whole lot of innovation going on I I'm
not necessarily seeing any scientific

7244
02:24:51,830 --> 02:24:51,840
not necessarily seeing any scientific
 

7245
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:54,510
not necessarily seeing any scientific
evidence from neuralink and maybe that's

7246
02:24:54,510 --> 02:24:54,520
evidence from neuralink and maybe that's
 

7247
02:24:54,520 --> 02:24:56,190
evidence from neuralink and maybe that's
just I'm not looking for it but I'm not

7248
02:24:56,190 --> 02:24:56,200
just I'm not looking for it but I'm not
 

7249
02:24:56,200 --> 02:24:57,349
just I'm not looking for it but I'm not
seeing the evidence that they're

7250
02:24:57,349 --> 02:24:57,359
seeing the evidence that they're
 

7251
02:24:57,359 --> 02:24:59,830
seeing the evidence that they're
anywhere near where the scientific

7252
02:24:59,830 --> 02:24:59,840
anywhere near where the scientific
 

7253
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:01,269
anywhere near where the scientific
Community is and there's lots of

7254
02:25:01,269 --> 02:25:01,279
Community is and there's lots of
 

7255
02:25:01,279 --> 02:25:03,110
Community is and there's lots of
startups that are do incredibly

7256
02:25:03,110 --> 02:25:03,120
startups that are do incredibly
 

7257
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:04,510
startups that are do incredibly
Innovative stuff one of my colleagues

7258
02:25:04,510 --> 02:25:04,520
Innovative stuff one of my colleagues
 

7259
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:06,830

Serge staisy is just like a genius in

7260
02:25:06,830 --> 02:25:06,840
Serge staisy is just like a genius in
 

7261
02:25:06,840 --> 02:25:08,950
Serge staisy is just like a genius in
this area and and they're working on it

7262
02:25:08,950 --> 02:25:08,960
this area and and they're working on it
 

7263
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:11,990
this area and and they're working on it
I think speech Prosthetics like that are

7264
02:25:11,990 --> 02:25:12,000
I think speech Prosthetics like that are
 

7265
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,910
I think speech Prosthetics like that are
incorporating you know decoding

7266
02:25:13,910 --> 02:25:13,920
incorporating you know decoding
 

7267
02:25:13,920 --> 02:25:16,309
incorporating you know decoding
techniques with AI and you know movement

7268
02:25:16,309 --> 02:25:16,319
techniques with AI and you know movement
 

7269
02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:19,870
techniques with AI and you know movement
perspects this just like the the rate of

7270
02:25:19,870 --> 02:25:19,880
perspects this just like the the rate of
 

7271
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:21,950
perspects this just like the the rate of
progress is just enormous so part of the

7272
02:25:21,950 --> 02:25:21,960
progress is just enormous so part of the
 

7273
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:24,710
progress is just enormous so part of the
technology is having good enough data

7274
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:24,720
technology is having good enough data
 

7275
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:26,990
technology is having good enough data
and understanding which data to use and

7276
02:25:26,990 --> 02:25:27,000
and understanding which data to use and
 

7277
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,590
and understanding which data to use and
what to do with it right um and then the

7278
02:25:29,590 --> 02:25:29,600
what to do with it right um and then the
 

7279
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:31,670
what to do with it right um and then the
other part of it then is the algorithms

7280
02:25:31,670 --> 02:25:31,680
other part of it then is the algorithms
 

7281
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:33,950
other part of it then is the algorithms
for decoding it and so forth and and I

7282
02:25:33,950 --> 02:25:33,960
for decoding it and so forth and and I
 

7283
02:25:33,960 --> 02:25:35,790
for decoding it and so forth and and I
think part of that has really resulted

7284
02:25:35,790 --> 02:25:35,800
think part of that has really resulted
 

7285
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:37,230
think part of that has really resulted
in some real breakthroughs in

7286
02:25:37,230 --> 02:25:37,240
in some real breakthroughs in
 

7287
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:40,389
in some real breakthroughs in
Neuroscience as a result so um there's

7288
02:25:40,389 --> 02:25:40,399
Neuroscience as a result so um there's
 

7289
02:25:40,399 --> 02:25:42,269
Neuroscience as a result so um there's
lots of new technologies like

7290
02:25:42,269 --> 02:25:42,279
lots of new technologies like
 

7291
02:25:42,279 --> 02:25:43,990
lots of new technologies like
neuropixels for instance that allow you

7292
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:44,000
neuropixels for instance that allow you
 

7293
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,269
neuropixels for instance that allow you
to harvest activity from many many

7294
02:25:46,269 --> 02:25:46,279
to harvest activity from many many
 

7295
02:25:46,279 --> 02:25:48,870
to harvest activity from many many
neurons from a single electrode um I

7296
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:48,880
neurons from a single electrode um I
 

7297
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,750
neurons from a single electrode um I
know neuralink has some

7298
02:25:50,750 --> 02:25:50,760
know neuralink has some
 

7299
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:52,710
know neuralink has some
technologies that are also along these

7300
02:25:52,710 --> 02:25:52,720
technologies that are also along these
 

7301
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:55,750
technologies that are also along these
lines but I even again because they do

7302
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:55,760
lines but I even again because they do
 

7303
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:57,950
lines but I even again because they do
their own stuff the scientific Community

7304
02:25:57,950 --> 02:25:57,960
their own stuff the scientific Community
 

7305
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:01,670
their own stuff the scientific Community
doesn't see it right um but I think BCI

7306
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:01,680
doesn't see it right um but I think BCI
 

7307
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:04,269
doesn't see it right um but I think BCI
is much much bigger than neuralink and

7308
02:26:04,269 --> 02:26:04,279
is much much bigger than neuralink and
 

7309
02:26:04,279 --> 02:26:06,349
is much much bigger than neuralink and
there's just so much Innovation

7310
02:26:06,349 --> 02:26:06,359
there's just so much Innovation
 

7311
02:26:06,359 --> 02:26:08,670
there's just so much Innovation
happening I think the interesting

7312
02:26:08,670 --> 02:26:08,680
happening I think the interesting
 

7313
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:11,309
happening I think the interesting
question which we may be getting into is

7314
02:26:11,309 --> 02:26:11,319
question which we may be getting into is
 

7315
02:26:11,319 --> 02:26:12,910
question which we may be getting into is
I was talking to Sergey a while ago

7316
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:12,920
I was talking to Sergey a while ago
 

7317
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:14,990
I was talking to Sergey a while ago
about you know so a lot of language it's

7318
02:26:14,990 --> 02:26:15,000
about you know so a lot of language it's
 

7319
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:18,870
about you know so a lot of language it's
not just what we hear and what we speak

7320
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:18,880
not just what we hear and what we speak
 

7321
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:21,710
not just what we hear and what we speak
but also our intentions in our internal

7322
02:26:21,710 --> 02:26:21,720
but also our intentions in our internal
 

7323
02:26:21,720 --> 02:26:23,950
but also our intentions in our internal
models and you know so are you really

7324
02:26:23,950 --> 02:26:23,960
models and you know so are you really
 

7325
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:25,710
models and you know so are you really
going to be able to restore language

7326
02:26:25,710 --> 02:26:25,720
going to be able to restore language
 

7327
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:27,910
going to be able to restore language
without dealing with that part of it and

7328
02:26:27,910 --> 02:26:27,920
without dealing with that part of it and
 

7329
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:29,469
without dealing with that part of it and
he brought up a really interesting

7330
02:26:29,469 --> 02:26:29,479
he brought up a really interesting
 

7331
02:26:29,479 --> 02:26:32,349
he brought up a really interesting
question which is the ethics of reading

7332
02:26:32,349 --> 02:26:32,359
question which is the ethics of reading
 

7333
02:26:32,359 --> 02:26:35,469
question which is the ethics of reading
out people's intentions and

7334
02:26:35,469 --> 02:26:35,479
out people's intentions and
 

7335
02:26:35,479 --> 02:26:37,110
out people's intentions and
understanding of the world as opposed to

7336
02:26:37,110 --> 02:26:37,120
understanding of the world as opposed to
 

7337
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:40,510
understanding of the world as opposed to
the more you know the the more concrete

7338
02:26:40,510 --> 02:26:40,520
the more you know the the more concrete
 

7339
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:43,389
the more you know the the more concrete
parts of hearing and producing movements

7340
02:26:43,389 --> 02:26:43,399
parts of hearing and producing movements
 

7341
02:26:43,399 --> 02:26:45,070
parts of hearing and producing movements
right just so we're clear because you

7342
02:26:45,070 --> 02:26:45,080
right just so we're clear because you
 

7343
02:26:45,080 --> 02:26:46,830
right just so we're clear because you
said a few interesting things when you

7344
02:26:46,830 --> 02:26:46,840
said a few interesting things when you
 

7345
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:48,830
said a few interesting things when you
say when we talk about language and bcis

7346
02:26:48,830 --> 02:26:48,840
say when we talk about language and bcis
 

7347
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:51,269
say when we talk about language and bcis
what we mean is getting signal from the

7348
02:26:51,269 --> 02:26:51,279
what we mean is getting signal from the
 

7349
02:26:51,279 --> 02:26:52,469
what we mean is getting signal from the
brain and

7350
02:26:52,469 --> 02:26:52,479
brain and
 

7351
02:26:52,479 --> 02:26:54,910
brain and
generating the language say you're not

7352
02:26:54,910 --> 02:26:54,920
generating the language say you're not
 

7353
02:26:54,920 --> 02:26:56,590
generating the language say you're not
able to actually

7354
02:26:56,590 --> 02:26:56,600
able to actually
 

7355
02:26:56,600 --> 02:27:00,830
able to actually
speak uh it's as a kind of linguistic

7356
02:27:00,830 --> 02:27:00,840
speak uh it's as a kind of linguistic
 

7357
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:04,830
speak uh it's as a kind of linguistic
prosthetic it it's able to speak for you

7358
02:27:04,830 --> 02:27:04,840
prosthetic it it's able to speak for you
 

7359
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:07,150
prosthetic it it's able to speak for you
exactly what you wanted to say and then

7360
02:27:07,150 --> 02:27:07,160
exactly what you wanted to say and then
 

7361
02:27:07,160 --> 02:27:10,150
exactly what you wanted to say and then
the deeper question is well saying

7362
02:27:10,150 --> 02:27:10,160
the deeper question is well saying
 

7363
02:27:10,160 --> 02:27:13,710
the deeper question is well saying
something isn't just the letters the the

behind all that kind of stuff and is it
 

7371
02:27:19,319 --> 02:27:21,950
behind all that kind of stuff and is it
ethical to reveal that full shebang the

in our brain that's really that's really
 

7377
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:30,110
in our brain that's really that's really
interesting that's really I mean our

02:27:30,110 --> 02:27:30,120
interesting that's really I mean our
 

7379
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:33,349
interesting that's really I mean our

02:29:04,240 --> 02:29:06,590
and probably Humanity starts to get
awfully tricky when you start to be able

7454
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:06,600
awfully tricky when you start to be able
 

7455
02:29:06,600 --> 02:29:09,389
awfully tricky when you start to be able
to collect those thoughts but I I what I

7456
02:29:09,389 --> 02:29:09,399
to collect those thoughts but I I what I
 

7457
02:29:09,399 --> 02:29:12,510
to collect those thoughts but I I what I
wanted to actually ask you is do you

7458
02:29:12,510 --> 02:29:12,520
wanted to actually ask you is do you
 

7459
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:15,910
wanted to actually ask you is do you
think for fun and for practical P

7460
02:29:15,910 --> 02:29:15,920
think for fun and for practical P
 

7461
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:18,710
think for fun and for practical P
purposes you'll be able to we would be

7462
02:29:18,710 --> 02:29:18,720
purposes you'll be able to we would be
 

7463
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:22,790
purposes you'll be able to we would be
able to modify

7464
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:22,800
able to modify
 

7465
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:26,990
able to modify
memories so how difficult is it to how

7466
02:29:26,990 --> 02:29:27,000
memories so how difficult is it to how
 

7467
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,349
memories so how difficult is it to how
far away we are from understanding the

7468
02:29:29,349 --> 02:29:29,359
far away we are from understanding the
 

7469
02:29:29,359 --> 02:29:31,070
far away we are from understanding the
different parts of the brains everything

7470
02:29:31,070 --> 02:29:31,080
different parts of the brains everything
 

7471
02:29:31,080 --> 02:29:33,750
different parts of the brains everything
we've been talking about in order to

7472
02:29:33,750 --> 02:29:33,760
we've been talking about in order to
 

7473
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,550
we've been talking about in order to
figure out how can we adjust this memory

7474
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:36,560
figure out how can we adjust this memory
 

7475
02:29:36,560 --> 02:29:39,269
figure out how can we adjust this memory
at the crude level from unpleasant to

7476
02:29:39,269 --> 02:29:39,279
at the crude level from unpleasant to
 

7477
02:29:39,279 --> 02:29:41,070
at the crude level from unpleasant to
Pleasant you talked about we can

7478
02:29:41,070 --> 02:29:41,080
Pleasant you talked about we can
 

7479
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:44,070
Pleasant you talked about we can
remember the mall and the people like

7480
02:29:44,070 --> 02:29:44,080
remember the mall and the people like
 

7481
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:45,990
remember the mall and the people like
location the people can we keep the

7482
02:29:45,990 --> 02:29:46,000
location the people can we keep the
 

7483
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,870
location the people can we keep the
people and change the place like this

7484
02:29:47,870 --> 02:29:47,880
people and change the place like this
 

7485
02:29:47,880 --> 02:29:50,550
people and change the place like this
kind of stuff how difficult is that well

7486
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:50,560
kind of stuff how difficult is that well
 

7487
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:52,710
kind of stuff how difficult is that well
I mean in some sense we know we can do

7488
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:52,720
I mean in some sense we know we can do
 

7489
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:55,429
I mean in some sense we know we can do
it just behaviorally right just like

7490
02:29:55,429 --> 02:29:55,439
it just behaviorally right just like
 

7491
02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:57,710
it just behaviorally right just like
tell you give you know under certain

7492
02:29:57,710 --> 02:29:57,720
tell you give you know under certain
 

7493
02:29:57,720 --> 02:29:59,750
tell you give you know under certain
conditions anyway it can give you the

7494
02:29:59,750 --> 02:29:59,760
conditions anyway it can give you the
 

7495
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:01,510
conditions anyway it can give you the
misinformation and then you can change

7496
02:30:01,510 --> 02:30:01,520
misinformation and then you can change
 

7497
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:03,590
misinformation and then you can change
the people and the places and so forth

7498
02:30:03,590 --> 02:30:03,600
the people and the places and so forth
 

7499
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:06,830
the people and the places and so forth
right um on the crude level there's a

7500
02:30:06,830 --> 02:30:06,840
right um on the crude level there's a
 

7501
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:08,670
right um on the crude level there's a
lot of work that's being done on a

7502
02:30:08,670 --> 02:30:08,680
lot of work that's being done on a
 

7503
02:30:08,680 --> 02:30:10,110
lot of work that's being done on a
phenomenon called

7504
02:30:10,110 --> 02:30:10,120
phenomenon called
 

7505
02:30:10,120 --> 02:30:12,670
phenomenon called
reconsolidation which is this uh idea

7506
02:30:12,670 --> 02:30:12,680
reconsolidation which is this uh idea
 

7507
02:30:12,680 --> 02:30:15,309
reconsolidation which is this uh idea
that essentially when I recall a memory

7508
02:30:15,309 --> 02:30:15,319
that essentially when I recall a memory
 

7509
02:30:15,319 --> 02:30:16,870
that essentially when I recall a memory
um what happens is is that the

7510
02:30:16,870 --> 02:30:16,880
um what happens is is that the
 

7511
02:30:16,880 --> 02:30:18,790
um what happens is is that the
connections between the neurons and that

7512
02:30:18,790 --> 02:30:18,800
connections between the neurons and that
 

7513
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:21,230
connections between the neurons and that
cell assembly that give you the memory

7514
02:30:21,230 --> 02:30:21,240
cell assembly that give you the memory
 

7515
02:30:21,240 --> 02:30:25,030
cell assembly that give you the memory
um are going to be like more

7516
02:30:25,030 --> 02:30:25,040
um are going to be like more
 

7517
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:27,750
um are going to be like more
modifiable and so some people have used

7518
02:30:27,750 --> 02:30:27,760
modifiable and so some people have used
 

7519
02:30:27,760 --> 02:30:29,510
modifiable and so some people have used
techniques to try to like for instance

7520
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:29,520
techniques to try to like for instance
 

7521
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:32,230
techniques to try to like for instance
with fear memories to reduce that

7522
02:30:32,230 --> 02:30:32,240
with fear memories to reduce that
 

7523
02:30:32,240 --> 02:30:34,710
with fear memories to reduce that
physical visceral component of the

7524
02:30:34,710 --> 02:30:34,720
physical visceral component of the
 

7525
02:30:34,720 --> 02:30:37,230
physical visceral component of the
memory when it's being activated right

7526
02:30:37,230 --> 02:30:37,240
memory when it's being activated right
 

7527
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:39,510
memory when it's being activated right
now I think I've as an outsider looking

7528
02:30:39,510 --> 02:30:39,520
now I think I've as an outsider looking
 

7529
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:41,349
now I think I've as an outsider looking
at the data I think it's like mixed

7530
02:30:41,349 --> 02:30:41,359
at the data I think it's like mixed
 

7531
02:30:41,359 --> 02:30:44,230
at the data I think it's like mixed
results um and part of it is and this

7532
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:44,240
results um and part of it is and this
 

7533
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:47,910
results um and part of it is and this
speaks to the more complex issue is that

7534
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:47,920
speaks to the more complex issue is that
 

7535
02:30:47,920 --> 02:30:50,510
speaks to the more complex issue is that
you don't you need somebody to actually

7536
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:50,520
you don't you need somebody to actually
 

7537
02:30:50,520 --> 02:30:53,150
you don't you need somebody to actually
fully recall that traumatic memory in

7538
02:30:53,150 --> 02:30:53,160
fully recall that traumatic memory in
 

7539
02:30:53,160 --> 02:30:56,790
fully recall that traumatic memory in
the first place and in order to actually

7540
02:30:56,790 --> 02:30:56,800
the first place and in order to actually
 

7541
02:30:56,800 --> 02:30:59,630
the first place and in order to actually
modify it then what is the memory that

7542
02:30:59,630 --> 02:30:59,640
modify it then what is the memory that
 

7543
02:30:59,640 --> 02:31:02,230
modify it then what is the memory that
is the key part of the problem so if we

7544
02:31:02,230 --> 02:31:02,240
is the key part of the problem so if we
 

7545
02:31:02,240 --> 02:31:03,950
is the key part of the problem so if we
go back to reading people's thoughts

7546
02:31:03,950 --> 02:31:03,960
go back to reading people's thoughts
 

7547
02:31:03,960 --> 02:31:06,750
go back to reading people's thoughts
what is the thought I mean people can

7548
02:31:06,750 --> 02:31:06,760
what is the thought I mean people can
 

7549
02:31:06,760 --> 02:31:08,230
what is the thought I mean people can
sometimes look at this like behaviorists

7550
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:08,240
sometimes look at this like behaviorists
 

7551
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:10,469
sometimes look at this like behaviorists
and go well the memory is like I've

7552
02:31:10,469 --> 02:31:10,479
and go well the memory is like I've
 

7553
02:31:10,479 --> 02:31:12,469
and go well the memory is like I've
given you a and you produce B but I

7554
02:31:12,469 --> 02:31:12,479
given you a and you produce B but I
 

7555
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:15,030
given you a and you produce B but I
think that's a very bankrupt concept

7556
02:31:15,030 --> 02:31:15,040
think that's a very bankrupt concept
 

7557
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:16,910
think that's a very bankrupt concept
about memory I think it's it's much more

7558
02:31:16,910 --> 02:31:16,920
about memory I think it's it's much more
 

7559
02:31:16,920 --> 02:31:18,830
about memory I think it's it's much more
complicated than that and you know one

7560
02:31:18,830 --> 02:31:18,840
complicated than that and you know one
 

7561
02:31:18,840 --> 02:31:20,190
complicated than that and you know one
of the things that when we started

7562
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:20,200
of the things that when we started
 

7563
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:22,309
of the things that when we started
studying naturalistic memory like memory

7564
02:31:22,309 --> 02:31:22,319
studying naturalistic memory like memory
 

7565
02:31:22,319 --> 02:31:24,910
studying naturalistic memory like memory
from movies that was so hard was we had

7566
02:31:24,910 --> 02:31:24,920
from movies that was so hard was we had
 

7567
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:26,750
from movies that was so hard was we had
to change the way we did the studies

7568
02:31:26,750 --> 02:31:26,760
to change the way we did the studies
 

7569
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:30,590
to change the way we did the studies
because if I show you movie and I show

7570
02:31:30,590 --> 02:31:30,600
because if I show you movie and I show
 

7571
02:31:30,600 --> 02:31:33,349
because if I show you movie and I show
and I watch the same movie and you

7572
02:31:33,349 --> 02:31:33,359
and I watch the same movie and you
 

7573
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:35,110
and I watch the same movie and you
recall everything that happened and I

7574
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:35,120
recall everything that happened and I
 

7575
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:37,309
recall everything that happened and I
recall everything that happened we might

7576
02:31:37,309 --> 02:31:37,319
recall everything that happened we might
 

7577
02:31:37,319 --> 02:31:39,150
recall everything that happened we might
take a different amount of time to do it

7578
02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:39,160
take a different amount of time to do it
 

7579
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:41,510
take a different amount of time to do it
we might use different words and yet to

7580
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,520
we might use different words and yet to
 

7581
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:42,910
we might use different words and yet to
an outside Observer we might have

7582
02:31:42,910 --> 02:31:42,920
an outside Observer we might have
 

7583
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:45,670
an outside Observer we might have
recalled the same thing right so it's

7584
02:31:45,670 --> 02:31:45,680
recalled the same thing right so it's
 

7585
02:31:45,680 --> 02:31:48,030
recalled the same thing right so it's
not about the words necessarily and it's

7586
02:31:48,030 --> 02:31:48,040
not about the words necessarily and it's
 

7587
02:31:48,040 --> 02:31:50,790
not about the words necessarily and it's
not about how long we spent or whatever

7588
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:50,800
not about how long we spent or whatever
 

7589
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:53,030
not about how long we spent or whatever
there's something deeper that is there

7590
02:31:53,030 --> 02:31:53,040
there's something deeper that is there
 

7591
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:55,269
there's something deeper that is there
that's this idea but it's like how do

7592
02:31:55,269 --> 02:31:55,279
that's this idea but it's like how do
 

7593
02:31:55,279 --> 02:31:58,429
that's this idea but it's like how do
you understand that thought I encounter

7594
02:31:58,429 --> 02:31:58,439
you understand that thought I encounter
 

7595
02:31:58,439 --> 02:32:00,429
you understand that thought I encounter
a lot of concrete thinking that it's

7596
02:32:00,429 --> 02:32:00,439
a lot of concrete thinking that it's
 

7597
02:32:00,439 --> 02:32:02,190
a lot of concrete thinking that it's
like if I

7598
02:32:02,190 --> 02:32:02,200
like if I
 

7599
02:32:02,200 --> 02:32:05,309
like if I
show a model like you know the visual

7600
02:32:05,309 --> 02:32:05,319
show a model like you know the visual
 

7601
02:32:05,319 --> 02:32:07,389
show a model like you know the visual
information that a person sees when they

7602
02:32:07,389 --> 02:32:07,399
information that a person sees when they
 

7603
02:32:07,399 --> 02:32:10,190
information that a person sees when they
drive I can basically reverse engineer

7604
02:32:10,190 --> 02:32:10,200
drive I can basically reverse engineer
 

7605
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:12,469
drive I can basically reverse engineer
driving well that's not really how it

7606
02:32:12,469 --> 02:32:12,479
driving well that's not really how it
 

7607
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:15,750
driving well that's not really how it
works I once saw a talk by somebody or I

7609
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:17,790
works I once saw a talk by somebody or I
saw somebody talking in this discussion

7610
02:32:17,790 --> 02:32:17,800
saw somebody talking in this discussion
 

7611
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:20,630
saw somebody talking in this discussion
of between neuroscientists and AI people

7612
02:32:20,630 --> 02:32:20,640
of between neuroscientists and AI people
 

7613
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:23,070
of between neuroscientists and AI people
and he was saying that the problem with

7614
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:23,080
and he was saying that the problem with
 

7615
02:32:23,080 --> 02:32:25,070
and he was saying that the problem with
self-driving cars that they had in

7616
02:32:25,070 --> 02:32:25,080
self-driving cars that they had in
 

7617
02:32:25,080 --> 02:32:27,550
self-driving cars that they had in
cities as opposed to highways was that

7618
02:32:27,550 --> 02:32:27,560
cities as opposed to highways was that
 

7619
02:32:27,560 --> 02:32:31,230
cities as opposed to highways was that
the car was okay at you know doing the

7620
02:32:31,230 --> 02:32:31,240
the car was okay at you know doing the
 

7621
02:32:31,240 --> 02:32:33,429
the car was okay at you know doing the
things it's supposed to but when there

7622
02:32:33,429 --> 02:32:33,439
things it's supposed to but when there
 

7623
02:32:33,439 --> 02:32:34,950
things it's supposed to but when there
were pedestrians around it couldn't

7624
02:32:34,950 --> 02:32:34,960
were pedestrians around it couldn't
 

7625
02:32:34,960 --> 02:32:37,910
were pedestrians around it couldn't
predict the intentions of people and so

7626
02:32:37,910 --> 02:32:37,920
predict the intentions of people and so
 

7627
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:40,429
predict the intentions of people and so
that unpredictability of people was the

7628
02:32:40,429 --> 02:32:40,439
that unpredictability of people was the
 

7629
02:32:40,439 --> 02:32:42,550
that unpredictability of people was the
problem that they were having in you

7630
02:32:42,550 --> 02:32:42,560
problem that they were having in you
 

7631
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:44,269
problem that they were having in you
know the self-driving car design because

7632
02:32:44,269 --> 02:32:44,279
know the self-driving car design because
 

7633
02:32:44,279 --> 02:32:47,309
know the self-driving car design because
it didn't have a good enough internal

7634
02:32:47,309 --> 02:32:47,319
it didn't have a good enough internal
 

7635
02:32:47,319 --> 02:32:50,590
it didn't have a good enough internal
model of what the people were you know

7636
02:32:50,590 --> 02:32:50,600
model of what the people were you know
 

7637
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:52,910
model of what the people were you know
what they were doing what they wanted

7638
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:52,920
what they were doing what they wanted
 

7639
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:54,630
what they were doing what they wanted
and what do you think about that well I

7640
02:32:54,630 --> 02:32:54,640
and what do you think about that well I
 

7641
02:32:54,640 --> 02:32:56,950
and what do you think about that well I
spent a huge amount of

7642
02:32:56,950 --> 02:32:56,960
spent a huge amount of
 

7643
02:32:56,960 --> 02:33:00,309
spent a huge amount of
time watching pedestrians thinking about

7644
02:33:00,309 --> 02:33:00,319
time watching pedestrians thinking about
 

7645
02:33:00,319 --> 02:33:02,150
time watching pedestrians thinking about
pedestrians thinking about what it takes

7646
02:33:02,150 --> 02:33:02,160
pedestrians thinking about what it takes
 

7647
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:06,830
pedestrians thinking about what it takes
to solve the problem of

7648
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:06,840

 

7649
02:33:06,840 --> 02:33:11,349

uh uh measuring detecting the intention

7650
02:33:11,349 --> 02:33:11,359
uh uh measuring detecting the intention
 

7651
02:33:11,359 --> 02:33:14,110
uh uh measuring detecting the intention
of a pedestrian really of a human being

7652
02:33:14,110 --> 02:33:14,120
of a pedestrian really of a human being
 

7653
02:33:14,120 --> 02:33:16,389
of a pedestrian really of a human being
in this particular context of uh having

7654
02:33:16,389 --> 02:33:16,399
in this particular context of uh having
 

7655
02:33:16,399 --> 02:33:20,349
in this particular context of uh having
to cross the street and it's fascinating

7656
02:33:20,349 --> 02:33:20,359
to cross the street and it's fascinating
 

7657
02:33:20,359 --> 02:33:23,950
to cross the street and it's fascinating
I think uh I think it's a window

7658
02:33:23,950 --> 02:33:23,960
I think uh I think it's a window
 

7659
02:33:23,960 --> 02:33:28,269
I think uh I think it's a window
into how complex social systems are that

7660
02:33:28,269 --> 02:33:28,279
into how complex social systems are that
 

7661
02:33:28,279 --> 02:33:33,630
into how complex social systems are that
involve humans because you know I would

7662
02:33:33,630 --> 02:33:33,640
involve humans because you know I would
 

7663
02:33:33,640 --> 02:33:35,349
involve humans because you know I would
just stand there and watch intersections

7664
02:33:35,349 --> 02:33:35,359
just stand there and watch intersections
 

7665
02:33:35,359 --> 02:33:37,590
just stand there and watch intersections
for hours and what you start to figure

7666
02:33:37,590 --> 02:33:37,600
for hours and what you start to figure
 

7667
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:40,550
for hours and what you start to figure
out is every single intersection has its

7668
02:33:40,550 --> 02:33:40,560
out is every single intersection has its
 

7669
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:43,190
out is every single intersection has its
own personality so like there's a

7670
02:33:43,190 --> 02:33:43,200
own personality so like there's a
 

7671
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,110
own personality so like there's a
history to that intersection like jayw

7672
02:33:45,110 --> 02:33:45,120
history to that intersection like jayw
 

7673
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:46,510
history to that intersection like jayw
walking

7674
02:33:46,510 --> 02:33:46,520
walking
 

7675
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:50,389
walking
certain um intersections

7676
02:33:50,389 --> 02:33:50,399
certain um intersections
 

7677
02:33:50,399 --> 02:33:52,429
certain um intersections
allow jaywalking a lot more because what

7678
02:33:52,429 --> 02:33:52,439
allow jaywalking a lot more because what
 

7679
02:33:52,439 --> 02:33:53,950
allow jaywalking a lot more because what
happens

7680
02:33:53,950 --> 02:33:53,960
happens
 

7681
02:33:53,960 --> 02:33:56,790
happens
is uh we're leaders and followers so

7682
02:33:56,790 --> 02:33:56,800
is uh we're leaders and followers so
 

7683
02:33:56,800 --> 02:33:58,630
is uh we're leaders and followers so
there's a regular let's say and they

7684
02:33:58,630 --> 02:33:58,640
there's a regular let's say and they
 

7685
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:00,309
there's a regular let's say and they
they get off the subway and they start

7686
02:34:00,309 --> 02:34:00,319
they get off the subway and they start
 

7687
02:34:00,319 --> 02:34:02,230
they get off the subway and they start
Crossing on a red light and they do this

7688
02:34:02,230 --> 02:34:02,240
Crossing on a red light and they do this
 

7689
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:04,269
Crossing on a red light and they do this
every single day mhm and then there's

7690
02:34:04,269 --> 02:34:04,279
every single day mhm and then there's
 

7691
02:34:04,279 --> 02:34:05,349
every single day mhm and then there's
people that don't show up to that

7692
02:34:05,349 --> 02:34:05,359
people that don't show up to that
 

7693
02:34:05,359 --> 02:34:06,830
people that don't show up to that
intersection often and they're looking

7694
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:06,840
intersection often and they're looking
 

7695
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:08,630
intersection often and they're looking
for cues of how we're supposed to behave

7696
02:34:08,630 --> 02:34:08,640
for cues of how we're supposed to behave
 

7697
02:34:08,640 --> 02:34:10,670
for cues of how we're supposed to behave
here and if a few people start the

7698
02:34:10,670 --> 02:34:10,680
here and if a few people start the
 

7699
02:34:10,680 --> 02:34:13,269
here and if a few people start the
jaywalk and cross on red light uh they

7700
02:34:13,269 --> 02:34:13,279
jaywalk and cross on red light uh they
 

7701
02:34:13,279 --> 02:34:16,230
jaywalk and cross on red light uh they
will also they will follow and there's

7702
02:34:16,230 --> 02:34:16,240
will also they will follow and there's
 

7703
02:34:16,240 --> 02:34:18,349
will also they will follow and there's
just a dynamic to that intersection

7704
02:34:18,349 --> 02:34:18,359
just a dynamic to that intersection
 

7705
02:34:18,359 --> 02:34:20,269
just a dynamic to that intersection
there's a spirit to it and if you look

7706
02:34:20,269 --> 02:34:20,279
there's a spirit to it and if you look
 

7707
02:34:20,279 --> 02:34:23,550
there's a spirit to it and if you look
at Boston versus New York uh versus a

7708
02:34:23,550 --> 02:34:23,560
at Boston versus New York uh versus a
 

7709
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:25,710
at Boston versus New York uh versus a
rural Town versus even Boston San

Francisco here in Austin it's there's
 

7713
02:34:28,279 --> 02:34:30,150
Francisco here in Austin it's there's
different personalities Citywide but

7714

personalities different intersections
 

7721
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:37,790

and it's it's just fascinating for for a

7722
02:34:37,790 --> 02:34:37,800
and it's it's just fascinating for for a
 

7723
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:40,630

car to be able to determine that is
 

7725
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:43,269
car to be able to determine that is
tricky now what machine learning systems

7726
02:34:43,269 --> 02:34:43,279
tricky now what machine learning systems
 

7727
02:34:43,279 --> 02:34:45,110
tricky now what machine learning systems
are able to do well is collect a huge

7729
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,349
are able to do well is collect a huge
amount of data so for us It's tricky

7730
02:34:47,349 --> 02:34:47,359
amount of data so for us It's tricky
 

7731
02:34:47,359 --> 02:34:49,910
amount of data so for us It's tricky
because we get to like understand the

because we get to like understand the
 

7733
02:34:49,920 --> 02:34:52,550
because we get to like understand the

really torn in both directions if you
 

7747
02:35:07,800 --> 02:35:10,030
really torn in both directions if you
just collect a huge amount of

02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:12,670
just collect a huge amount of

data all of that information and then
 

7751
02:35:12,680 --> 02:35:15,710
data all of that information and then
compress it into uh a representation of

book is one of the oldest kind of uh
dilemas in computational Neuroscience is

7922
02:38:39,790 --> 02:38:39,800
dilemas in computational Neuroscience is
 

7923
02:38:39,800 --> 02:38:41,309
dilemas in computational Neuroscience is
what Steve grossberg called the

7924
02:38:41,309 --> 02:38:41,319
what Steve grossberg called the
 

7925
02:38:41,319 --> 02:38:43,309
what Steve grossberg called the
stability plasticity dilemma right when

7926
02:38:43,309 --> 02:38:43,319
stability plasticity dilemma right when
 

7927
02:38:43,319 --> 02:38:46,830
stability plasticity dilemma right when
do you say something is new and

7928
02:38:46,830 --> 02:38:46,840
do you say something is new and
 

7929
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:48,670
do you say something is new and
overwrite your pre-existing knowledge

7930
02:38:48,670 --> 02:38:48,680
overwrite your pre-existing knowledge
 

7931
02:38:48,680 --> 02:38:50,910
overwrite your pre-existing knowledge
versus go going with what you had before

7932
02:38:50,910 --> 02:38:50,920
versus go going with what you had before
 

7933
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:53,590
versus go going with what you had before
and making incremental changes and so

7934
02:38:53,590 --> 02:38:53,600
and making incremental changes and so
 

7935
02:38:53,600 --> 02:38:56,910
and making incremental changes and so
you know part of the problem with going

7936
02:38:56,910 --> 02:38:56,920
you know part of the problem with going
 

7937
02:38:56,920 --> 02:38:59,910
you know part of the problem with going
through like massive you know I mean

7938
02:38:59,910 --> 02:38:59,920
through like massive you know I mean
 

7939
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:01,230
through like massive you know I mean
part of the problem of things like if

7940
02:39:01,230 --> 02:39:01,240
part of the problem of things like if
 

7941
02:39:01,240 --> 02:39:02,790
part of the problem of things like if
you're trying to design an llm or

7942
02:39:02,790 --> 02:39:02,800
you're trying to design an llm or
 

7943
02:39:02,800 --> 02:39:04,670
you're trying to design an llm or
something like that is especially for

7944
02:39:04,670 --> 02:39:04,680
something like that is especially for
 

7945
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:06,550
something like that is especially for
English there's so many exceptions to

7946
02:39:06,550 --> 02:39:06,560
English there's so many exceptions to
 

7947
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:09,309
English there's so many exceptions to
the rules right and so if you want to

7948
02:39:09,309 --> 02:39:09,319
the rules right and so if you want to
 

7949
02:39:09,319 --> 02:39:11,510
the rules right and so if you want to
rapidly learn the exceptions you're

7950
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:11,520
rapidly learn the exceptions you're
 

7951
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:13,710
rapidly learn the exceptions you're
going to lose the rules uh and if you

7952
02:39:13,710 --> 02:39:13,720
going to lose the rules uh and if you
 

7953
02:39:13,720 --> 02:39:15,750
going to lose the rules uh and if you
want to keep the rules you have a harder

7954
02:39:15,750 --> 02:39:15,760
want to keep the rules you have a harder
 

7955
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:19,030
want to keep the rules you have a harder
time learning the exception and so David

7956
02:39:19,030 --> 02:39:19,040
time learning the exception and so David
 

7957
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:22,230
time learning the exception and so David
Mar was one of the early Pioneers in uh

7958

7964
02:39:28,950 --> 02:39:28,960

Cohen all these people started to come

7966
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:31,720
Cohen all these people started to come
 

7967
02:39:31,720 --> 02:39:33,830
Cohen all these people started to come
up with the idea that maybe that's part

7968
02:39:33,830 --> 02:39:33,840
up with the idea that maybe that's part
 

7969
02:39:33,840 --> 02:39:36,309
up with the idea that maybe that's part
of what we need in what the human brain

7970
02:39:36,309 --> 02:39:36,319
of what we need in what the human brain
 

7971
02:39:36,319 --> 02:39:39,429
of what we need in what the human brain
is doing is we have this kind of a

7972
02:39:39,429 --> 02:39:39,439
is doing is we have this kind of a
 

7973
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:41,590
is doing is we have this kind of a
actually a fairly dumb system which just

7974
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:41,600
actually a fairly dumb system which just
 

7975
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:43,870
actually a fairly dumb system which just
says this happened once at this point in

7976
02:39:43,870 --> 02:39:43,880
says this happened once at this point in
 

7977
02:39:43,880 --> 02:39:46,630
says this happened once at this point in
time which we call episodic memory so to

7978
02:39:46,630 --> 02:39:46,640
time which we call episodic memory so to
 

7979
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:48,590
time which we call episodic memory so to
speak and then we have this knowledge

7980
02:39:48,590 --> 02:39:48,600
speak and then we have this knowledge
 

7981
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:50,110
speak and then we have this knowledge
that we've accumul ated from our

7982
02:39:50,110 --> 02:39:50,120
that we've accumul ated from our
 

7983
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:54,670
that we've accumul ated from our
experiences as semantic memory so now

7984
02:39:54,670 --> 02:39:54,680
experiences as semantic memory so now
 

7985
02:39:54,680 --> 02:39:57,550
experiences as semantic memory so now
when we want to we encounter a situation

7986
02:39:57,550 --> 02:39:57,560
when we want to we encounter a situation
 

7987
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:59,269
when we want to we encounter a situation
that's surprising and violates all our

7988
02:39:59,269 --> 02:39:59,279
that's surprising and violates all our
 

7989
02:39:59,279 --> 02:40:02,269
that's surprising and violates all our
previous expectations what happens is is

7990
02:40:02,269 --> 02:40:02,279
previous expectations what happens is is
 

7991
02:40:02,279 --> 02:40:04,389
previous expectations what happens is is
that now we can form an episodic memory

7992
02:40:04,389 --> 02:40:04,399
that now we can form an episodic memory
 

7993
02:40:04,399 --> 02:40:06,230
that now we can form an episodic memory
here and the next time we're in a

7994
02:40:06,230 --> 02:40:06,240
here and the next time we're in a
 

7995
02:40:06,240 --> 02:40:09,389
here and the next time we're in a
similar situation boom we can supplement

7996
02:40:09,389 --> 02:40:09,399
similar situation boom we can supplement
 

7997
02:40:09,399 --> 02:40:11,230
similar situation boom we can supplement
our knowledge with this information from

7998
02:40:11,230 --> 02:40:11,240
our knowledge with this information from
 

7999
02:40:11,240 --> 02:40:13,030
our knowledge with this information from
episodic memory and reason about what

8000
02:40:13,030 --> 02:40:13,040
episodic memory and reason about what
 

8001
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:15,309
episodic memory and reason about what
the right thing to do is right so it

8002
02:40:15,309 --> 02:40:15,319
the right thing to do is right so it
 

8003
02:40:15,319 --> 02:40:17,550
the right thing to do is right so it
gives us this enormous amount of

8004
02:40:17,550 --> 02:40:17,560
gives us this enormous amount of
 

8005
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:20,830
gives us this enormous amount of
flexibility to stop on a dime and change

8006
02:40:20,830 --> 02:40:20,840
flexibility to stop on a dime and change
 

8007
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:23,870
flexibility to stop on a dime and change
without having to erase everything we've

8008
02:40:23,870 --> 02:40:23,880
without having to erase everything we've
 

8009
02:40:23,880 --> 02:40:26,950
without having to erase everything we've
already learned and that solution is

8010
02:40:26,950 --> 02:40:26,960
already learned and that solution is
 

8011
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:29,630
already learned and that solution is
incredibly powerful because it it gives

8012
02:40:29,630 --> 02:40:29,640
incredibly powerful because it it gives
 

8013
02:40:29,640 --> 02:40:32,510
incredibly powerful because it it gives
you the ability to learn from so much

8014
02:40:32,510 --> 02:40:32,520
you the ability to learn from so much
 

8015
02:40:32,520 --> 02:40:34,870
you the ability to learn from so much
less information really right and and it

8016
02:40:34,870 --> 02:40:34,880
less information really right and and it
 

8017
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:36,110
less information really right and and it
gives you that

8018
02:40:36,110 --> 02:40:36,120
gives you that
 

8019
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:38,510
gives you that
flexibility so one of the things I think

8020
02:40:38,510 --> 02:40:38,520
flexibility so one of the things I think
 

8021
02:40:38,520 --> 02:40:40,710
flexibility so one of the things I think
that makes humans great is having both

8022
02:40:40,710 --> 02:40:40,720
that makes humans great is having both
 

8023
02:40:40,720 --> 02:40:45,230
that makes humans great is having both
episodic and semantic memory now can you

8024
02:40:45,230 --> 02:40:45,240
episodic and semantic memory now can you
 

8025
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:47,070
episodic and semantic memory now can you
build something like that I mean you

8026
02:40:47,070 --> 02:40:47,080
build something like that I mean you
 

8027
02:40:47,080 --> 02:40:49,349
build something like that I mean you
know computational Neuroscience people

8028
02:40:49,349 --> 02:40:49,359
know computational Neuroscience people
 

8029
02:40:49,359 --> 02:40:51,710
know computational Neuroscience people
say well yeah you just record a moment

8030
02:40:51,710 --> 02:40:51,720
say well yeah you just record a moment
 

8031
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:53,710
say well yeah you just record a moment
and you just get it and you're done

8032
02:40:53,710 --> 02:40:53,720
and you just get it and you're done
 

8033
02:40:53,720 --> 02:40:56,030
and you just get it and you're done
right but when do you record that moment

8034
02:40:56,030 --> 02:40:56,040
right but when do you record that moment
 

8035
02:40:56,040 --> 02:40:57,590
right but when do you record that moment
how much do you record what's the

8036
02:40:57,590 --> 02:40:57,600
how much do you record what's the
 

8037
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:59,230
how much do you record what's the
information you prioritize and what's

8038
02:40:59,230 --> 02:40:59,240
information you prioritize and what's
 

8039
02:40:59,240 --> 02:41:01,349
information you prioritize and what's
the information you don't these are the

8040
02:41:01,349 --> 02:41:01,359
the information you don't these are the
 

8041
02:41:01,359 --> 02:41:03,750
the information you don't these are the
hard questions when do you use episodic

8042
02:41:03,750 --> 02:41:03,760
hard questions when do you use episodic
 

8043
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:06,389
hard questions when do you use episodic
memory when do you just throw it away

8044
02:41:06,389 --> 02:41:06,399
memory when do you just throw it away
 

8045
02:41:06,399 --> 02:41:07,950
memory when do you just throw it away
and these are the hard questions we're

8046
02:41:07,950 --> 02:41:07,960
and these are the hard questions we're
 

8047
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:10,910
and these are the hard questions we're
still trying to figure out in people um

8048
02:41:10,910 --> 02:41:10,920
still trying to figure out in people um
 

8049
02:41:10,920 --> 02:41:12,269
still trying to figure out in people um
and then you start to think about all

8050
02:41:12,269 --> 02:41:12,279
and then you start to think about all
 

8051
02:41:12,279 --> 02:41:13,750
and then you start to think about all
these mechanisms that we have in the

8052
02:41:13,750 --> 02:41:13,760
these mechanisms that we have in the
 

8053
02:41:13,760 --> 02:41:15,269
these mechanisms that we have in the
brain for figuring out some of these

8054
02:41:15,269 --> 02:41:15,279
brain for figuring out some of these
 

8055
02:41:15,279 --> 02:41:17,590
brain for figuring out some of these
things it's not just one but it's many

8056
02:41:17,590 --> 02:41:17,600
things it's not just one but it's many
 

8057
02:41:17,600 --> 02:41:18,990
things it's not just one but it's many
of them that are interacting with each

8058
02:41:18,990 --> 02:41:19,000
of them that are interacting with each
 

8059
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,950
of them that are interacting with each
other and and then you just take not

8060
02:41:20,950 --> 02:41:20,960
other and and then you just take not
 

8061
02:41:20,960 --> 02:41:23,230
other and and then you just take not
only the episodic and the semantic but

8062
02:41:23,230 --> 02:41:23,240
only the episodic and the semantic but
 

8063
02:41:23,240 --> 02:41:25,429
only the episodic and the semantic but
then you start to take the motivational

8064
02:41:25,429 --> 02:41:25,439
then you start to take the motivational
 

8065
02:41:25,439 --> 02:41:27,670
then you start to take the motivational
survival things right it's just like the

8066
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:27,680
survival things right it's just like the
 

8067
02:41:27,680 --> 02:41:29,590
survival things right it's just like the
fight ORF flight responses that we

8068
02:41:29,590 --> 02:41:29,600
fight ORF flight responses that we
 

8069
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:32,150
fight ORF flight responses that we
associate with particular things or the

8070
02:41:32,150 --> 02:41:32,160
associate with particular things or the
 

8071
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:34,750
associate with particular things or the
kind of like uh reward motivation that

8072
02:41:34,750 --> 02:41:34,760
kind of like uh reward motivation that
 

8073
02:41:34,760 --> 02:41:36,510
kind of like uh reward motivation that
we associate with certain things so

8074
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:36,520
we associate with certain things so
 

8075
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:39,110
we associate with certain things so
forth and those things are absent from

8076
02:41:39,110 --> 02:41:39,120
forth and those things are absent from
 

8077
02:41:39,120 --> 02:41:41,389
forth and those things are absent from
AI I frankly don't know if we want it I

8078
02:41:41,389 --> 02:41:41,399
AI I frankly don't know if we want it I
 

8079
02:41:41,399 --> 02:41:44,190
AI I frankly don't know if we want it I
don't necessarily want a selfmotivated

8080
02:41:44,190 --> 02:41:44,200
don't necessarily want a selfmotivated
 

8081
02:41:44,200 --> 02:41:48,469
don't necessarily want a selfmotivated
llm right it's like uh and and then

8082
02:41:48,469 --> 02:41:48,479
llm right it's like uh and and then
 

8083
02:41:48,479 --> 02:41:50,150
llm right it's like uh and and then
there's the the problem of how do you

8084
02:41:50,150 --> 02:41:50,160
there's the the problem of how do you
 

8085
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:53,030
there's the the problem of how do you
even like build the motivations that

8086
02:41:53,030 --> 02:41:53,040
even like build the motivations that
 

8087
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,990
even like build the motivations that
should guide a proper reinforcement

8088
02:41:54,990 --> 02:41:55,000
should guide a proper reinforcement
 

8089
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,510
should guide a proper reinforcement
learning kind of thing for instance so

8090
02:41:57,510 --> 02:41:57,520
learning kind of thing for instance so
 

8091
02:41:57,520 --> 02:41:59,870
learning kind of thing for instance so
uh a friend of mine Sam gersman I might

8092
02:41:59,870 --> 02:41:59,880
uh a friend of mine Sam gersman I might
 

8093
02:41:59,880 --> 02:42:02,429
uh a friend of mine Sam gersman I might
be missing the quote exactly but he

8094
02:42:02,429 --> 02:42:02,439
be missing the quote exactly but he
 

8095
02:42:02,439 --> 02:42:04,830
be missing the quote exactly but he
basically said you know if I wanted to

8096
02:42:04,830 --> 02:42:04,840
basically said you know if I wanted to
 

8097
02:42:04,840 --> 02:42:07,910
basically said you know if I wanted to
train like a typical AI model to make me

8098
02:42:07,910 --> 02:42:07,920
train like a typical AI model to make me
 

8099
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:10,150
train like a typical AI model to make me
as much money as possible first thing I

8100
02:42:10,150 --> 02:42:10,160
as much money as possible first thing I
 

8101
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:11,670
as much money as possible first thing I
might do is sell my

8102
02:42:11,670 --> 02:42:11,680
might do is sell my
 

8103
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:14,830
might do is sell my
house so it's not even just about having

8104
02:42:14,830 --> 02:42:14,840
house so it's not even just about having
 

8105
02:42:14,840 --> 02:42:16,950
house so it's not even just about having
one goal or one objective but just

8106
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:16,960
one goal or one objective but just
 

8107
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,830
one goal or one objective but just
having all these competing goals and

8108
02:42:18,830 --> 02:42:18,840
having all these competing goals and
 

8109
02:42:18,840 --> 02:42:19,710
having all these competing goals and
objectives

8110
02:42:19,710 --> 02:42:19,720
objectives
 

8111
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:21,389
objectives
right and then things start to get

8112
02:42:21,389 --> 02:42:21,399
right and then things start to get
 

8113
02:42:21,399 --> 02:42:23,110
right and then things start to get
really complicated well it's all

8114
02:42:23,110 --> 02:42:23,120
really complicated well it's all
 

8115
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:24,630
really complicated well it's all
interconnected I mean just even the

8116
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:24,640
interconnected I mean just even the
 

8117
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:27,830
interconnected I mean just even the
thing you've mentioned is the moment you

8118
02:42:27,830 --> 02:42:27,840
thing you've mentioned is the moment you
 

8119
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:31,870
thing you've mentioned is the moment you
know if we record a moment like it's

8120
02:42:31,870 --> 02:42:31,880
know if we record a moment like it's
 

8121
02:42:31,880 --> 02:42:35,389
know if we record a moment like it's
difficult to express concretely what a

8122
02:42:35,389 --> 02:42:35,399
difficult to express concretely what a
 

8123
02:42:35,399 --> 02:42:38,389
difficult to express concretely what a
moment is like how deeply connected it

8124
02:42:38,389 --> 02:42:38,399
moment is like how deeply connected it
 

8125
02:42:38,399 --> 02:42:39,670
moment is like how deeply connected it
is to

8126
02:42:39,670 --> 02:42:39,680
is to
 

8127
02:42:39,680 --> 02:42:43,230
is to
the the entirety of it maybe to record a

8128
02:42:43,230 --> 02:42:43,240
the the entirety of it maybe to record a
 

8129
02:42:43,240 --> 02:42:46,429
the the entirety of it maybe to record a
moment you have to make a universe from

8130
02:42:46,429 --> 02:42:46,439
moment you have to make a universe from
 

8131
02:42:46,439 --> 02:42:48,469
moment you have to make a universe from
scratch you have to have you have to

8132
02:42:48,469 --> 02:42:48,479
scratch you have to have you have to
 

8133
02:42:48,479 --> 02:42:49,990
scratch you have to have you have to
include everything you have to include

8134
02:42:49,990 --> 02:42:50,000
include everything you have to include
 

8135
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,269
include everything you have to include
all the emotions involved all the

8136
02:42:51,269 --> 02:42:51,279
all the emotions involved all the
 

8137
02:42:51,279 --> 02:42:53,070
all the emotions involved all the
context all the things that built around

8138
02:42:53,070 --> 02:42:53,080
context all the things that built around
 

8139
02:42:53,080 --> 02:42:56,910
context all the things that built around
all the social connections all the um

8140
02:42:56,910 --> 02:42:56,920
all the social connections all the um
 

8141
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:58,910
all the social connections all the um
visual experiences all the sensory

8142
02:42:58,910 --> 02:42:58,920
visual experiences all the sensory
 

8143
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:00,830
visual experiences all the sensory
experience all of that all the history

8144
02:43:00,830 --> 02:43:00,840
experience all of that all the history
 

8145
02:43:00,840 --> 02:43:03,710
experience all of that all the history
that came before that moment is built on

8146
02:43:03,710 --> 02:43:03,720
that came before that moment is built on
 

8147
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:05,590
that came before that moment is built on
and we somehow take all that and we

8148
02:43:05,590 --> 02:43:05,600
and we somehow take all that and we
 

8149
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,750
and we somehow take all that and we
compress it and keep the useful parts

8150
02:43:07,750 --> 02:43:07,760
compress it and keep the useful parts
 

8151
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:11,309
compress it and keep the useful parts
and then integrated into the whole thing

8152
02:43:11,309 --> 02:43:11,319
and then integrated into the whole thing
 

8153
02:43:11,319 --> 02:43:13,670
and then integrated into the whole thing
into our whole narrative and then each

8154
02:43:13,670 --> 02:43:13,680
into our whole narrative and then each
 

8155
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:15,910
into our whole narrative and then each
individual has their own little version

8156
02:43:15,910 --> 02:43:15,920
individual has their own little version
 

8157
02:43:15,920 --> 02:43:17,830
individual has their own little version
of that narrative and then we Collide in

8158
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:17,840
of that narrative and then we Collide in
 

8159
02:43:17,840 --> 02:43:20,670
of that narrative and then we Collide in
the social way and we adjust it and we

8160
02:43:20,670 --> 02:43:20,680
the social way and we adjust it and we
 

8161
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:23,110
the social way and we adjust it and we
evolve yeah yeah I mean well even if we

8162
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:23,120
evolve yeah yeah I mean well even if we
 

8163
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:25,790
evolve yeah yeah I mean well even if we
want to go super simple right like um

8164
02:43:25,790 --> 02:43:25,800
want to go super simple right like um
 

8165
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:27,870
want to go super simple right like um
Tyler Bonin who's a postto who's

8166
02:43:27,870 --> 02:43:27,880
Tyler Bonin who's a postto who's
 

8167
02:43:27,880 --> 02:43:30,630
Tyler Bonin who's a postto who's
collaborating with me he actually

8168
02:43:30,630 --> 02:43:30,640
collaborating with me he actually
 

8169
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:33,670
collaborating with me he actually
studied uh a lot of computer vision at

8170
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:33,680
studied uh a lot of computer vision at
 

8171
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,750
studied uh a lot of computer vision at
Stanford and so one of the things he was

8172
02:43:35,750 --> 02:43:35,760
Stanford and so one of the things he was
 

8173
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:37,230
Stanford and so one of the things he was
interested in is some people who have

8174
02:43:37,230 --> 02:43:37,240
interested in is some people who have
 

8175
02:43:37,240 --> 02:43:38,910
interested in is some people who have
brain damage in areas of the brain that

8176
02:43:38,910 --> 02:43:38,920
brain damage in areas of the brain that
 

8177
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:41,510
brain damage in areas of the brain that
were thought to be important for memory

8178
02:43:41,510 --> 02:43:41,520
were thought to be important for memory
 

8179
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:43,670
were thought to be important for memory
and uh but they also seem to have some

8180
02:43:43,670 --> 02:43:43,680
and uh but they also seem to have some
 

8181
02:43:43,680 --> 02:43:45,710
and uh but they also seem to have some
perception problems with particular

8182
02:43:45,710 --> 02:43:45,720
perception problems with particular
 

8183
02:43:45,720 --> 02:43:47,750
perception problems with particular
kinds of object perception and this is

8184
02:43:47,750 --> 02:43:47,760
kinds of object perception and this is
 

8185
02:43:47,760 --> 02:43:49,790
kinds of object perception and this is
super controversial some people found

8186
02:43:49,790 --> 02:43:49,800
super controversial some people found
 

8187
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:52,510
super controversial some people found
this effect some didn't and he went back

8188
02:43:52,510 --> 02:43:52,520
this effect some didn't and he went back
 

8189
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:55,030
this effect some didn't and he went back
to computer vision and he said let's

8190
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:55,040
to computer vision and he said let's
 

8191
02:43:55,040 --> 02:43:56,710
to computer vision and he said let's
take the best state-of-the-art computer

8192
02:43:56,710 --> 02:43:56,720
take the best state-of-the-art computer
 

8193
02:43:56,720 --> 02:43:58,870
take the best state-of-the-art computer
vision models and let's give them the

8194
02:43:58,870 --> 02:43:58,880
vision models and let's give them the
 

8195
02:43:58,880 --> 02:44:00,790
vision models and let's give them the
same kinds of perception tests that we

8196
02:44:00,790 --> 02:44:00,800
same kinds of perception tests that we
 

8197
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:03,150
same kinds of perception tests that we
were giving to these people and then he

8198
02:44:03,150 --> 02:44:03,160
were giving to these people and then he
 

8199
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:05,110
were giving to these people and then he
would find the images where the computer

8200
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:05,120
would find the images where the computer
 

8201
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:07,110
would find the images where the computer
vision models would just struggle and

8202
02:44:07,110 --> 02:44:07,120
vision models would just struggle and
 

8203
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:08,750
vision models would just struggle and
you would find that they just didn't do

8204
02:44:08,750 --> 02:44:08,760
you would find that they just didn't do
 

8205
02:44:08,760 --> 02:44:11,269
you would find that they just didn't do
well even if you add more parameters you

8206
02:44:11,269 --> 02:44:11,279
well even if you add more parameters you
 

8207
02:44:11,279 --> 02:44:13,150
well even if you add more parameters you
add more layers on and on and on it

8208
02:44:13,150 --> 02:44:13,160
add more layers on and on and on it
 

8209
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:14,750
add more layers on and on and on it
doesn't help right the architecture

8210
02:44:14,750 --> 02:44:14,760
doesn't help right the architecture
 

8211
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:16,150
doesn't help right the architecture
didn't matter it was just there the

8212
02:44:16,150 --> 02:44:16,160
didn't matter it was just there the
 

8213
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:18,630
didn't matter it was just there the
problem and then he found those were the

8214
02:44:18,630 --> 02:44:18,640
problem and then he found those were the
 

8215
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:20,830
problem and then he found those were the
exact ones where these humans with

8216
02:44:20,830 --> 02:44:20,840
exact ones where these humans with
 

8217
02:44:20,840 --> 02:44:22,469
exact ones where these humans with
particular damage to this area called

8218
02:44:22,469 --> 02:44:22,479
particular damage to this area called
 

8219
02:44:22,479 --> 02:44:25,110
particular damage to this area called
the perinal cortex that was where they

8220
02:44:25,110 --> 02:44:25,120
the perinal cortex that was where they
 

8221
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:28,070
the perinal cortex that was where they
were struggling so somehow this brain

8222
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:28,080
were struggling so somehow this brain
 

8223
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:30,990
were struggling so somehow this brain
area was being was important for being

8224
02:44:30,990 --> 02:44:31,000
area was being was important for being
 

8225
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,590
area was being was important for being
able to do these things that were

8226
02:44:32,590 --> 02:44:32,600
able to do these things that were
 

8227
02:44:32,600 --> 02:44:35,190
able to do these things that were
adversarial to these computer vision

8228
02:44:35,190 --> 02:44:35,200
adversarial to these computer vision
 

8229
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:39,030
adversarial to these computer vision
models so then he found that the that it

8230
02:44:39,030 --> 02:44:39,040
models so then he found that the that it
 

8231
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:42,590
models so then he found that the that it
only happened if people had enough time

8232
02:44:42,590 --> 02:44:42,600
only happened if people had enough time
 

8233
02:44:42,600 --> 02:44:44,750
only happened if people had enough time
they could make those discriminations

8234
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:44,760
they could make those discriminations
 

8235
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:46,429
they could make those discriminations
but without enough time if they just get

8236
02:44:46,429 --> 02:44:46,439
but without enough time if they just get
 

8237
02:44:46,439 --> 02:44:47,910
but without enough time if they just get
a glance they're just like the computer

8238
02:44:47,910 --> 02:44:47,920
a glance they're just like the computer
 

8239
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:50,030
a glance they're just like the computer
vision models so then what he started to

8240
02:44:50,030 --> 02:44:50,040
vision models so then what he started to
 

8241
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:51,550
vision models so then what he started to
say was maybe let's look at people's

8242
02:44:51,550 --> 02:44:51,560
say was maybe let's look at people's
 

8243
02:44:51,560 --> 02:44:54,190
say was maybe let's look at people's
eyes right so computer vision model sees

8244
02:44:54,190 --> 02:44:54,200
eyes right so computer vision model sees
 

8245
02:44:54,200 --> 02:44:57,230
eyes right so computer vision model sees
every pixel all at once right it's not

8246
02:44:57,230 --> 02:44:57,240
every pixel all at once right it's not
 

8247
02:44:57,240 --> 02:44:59,710
every pixel all at once right it's not
you know and we don't we never see every

8248
02:44:59,710 --> 02:44:59,720
you know and we don't we never see every
 

8249
02:44:59,720 --> 02:45:01,550
you know and we don't we never see every
pixel all at once even if I'm looking at

8250
02:45:01,550 --> 02:45:01,560
pixel all at once even if I'm looking at
 

8251
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:03,110
pixel all at once even if I'm looking at
a screen with pixels I'm not seeing

8252
02:45:03,110 --> 02:45:03,120
a screen with pixels I'm not seeing
 

8253
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:05,710
a screen with pixels I'm not seeing
every pixel all at once I'm grabbing

8254
02:45:05,710 --> 02:45:05,720
every pixel all at once I'm grabbing
 

8255
02:45:05,720 --> 02:45:08,830
every pixel all at once I'm grabbing
little points on the screen by moving my

8256
02:45:08,830 --> 02:45:08,840
little points on the screen by moving my
 

8257
02:45:08,840 --> 02:45:10,990
little points on the screen by moving my
eyes around and getting a very high

8258
02:45:10,990 --> 02:45:11,000
eyes around and getting a very high
 

8259
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,110
eyes around and getting a very high
resolution picture of what I'm focusing

8260
02:45:13,110 --> 02:45:13,120
resolution picture of what I'm focusing
 

8261
02:45:13,120 --> 02:45:15,590
resolution picture of what I'm focusing
on and kind of a lower resolution

8262
02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:15,600
on and kind of a lower resolution
 

8263
02:45:15,600 --> 02:45:18,150
on and kind of a lower resolution
information about everything else but

8264
02:45:18,150 --> 02:45:18,160
information about everything else but
 

8265
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:20,870
information about everything else but
I'm ch not necessarily choosing but I'm

8266
02:45:20,870 --> 02:45:20,880
I'm ch not necessarily choosing but I'm
 

8267
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:23,030
I'm ch not necessarily choosing but I'm
directing that

8268
02:45:23,030 --> 02:45:23,040
directing that
 

8269
02:45:23,040 --> 02:45:25,790
directing that
exploration and allowing people to move

8270
02:45:25,790 --> 02:45:25,800
exploration and allowing people to move
 

8271
02:45:25,800 --> 02:45:27,269
exploration and allowing people to move
their eyes and integrate that

8272
02:45:27,269 --> 02:45:27,279
their eyes and integrate that
 

8273
02:45:27,279 --> 02:45:30,870
their eyes and integrate that
information gave them something that the

8274
02:45:30,870 --> 02:45:30,880
information gave them something that the
 

8275
02:45:30,880 --> 02:45:32,550
information gave them something that the
computer vision models weren't able to

8276
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:32,560
computer vision models weren't able to
 

8277
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:35,590
computer vision models weren't able to
do so somehow integrating information

8278
02:45:35,590 --> 02:45:35,600
do so somehow integrating information
 

8279
02:45:35,600 --> 02:45:38,590
do so somehow integrating information
across time and getting less information

8280
02:45:38,590 --> 02:45:38,600
across time and getting less information
 

8281
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:41,550
across time and getting less information
at each step gave you more out of the

8282
02:45:41,550 --> 02:45:41,560
at each step gave you more out of the
 

8283
02:45:41,560 --> 02:45:43,550
at each step gave you more out of the
process I

8284
02:45:43,550 --> 02:45:43,560
process I
 

8285
02:45:43,560 --> 02:45:48,990
process I
mean the process of allocating attention

8286
02:45:48,990 --> 02:45:49,000
mean the process of allocating attention
 

8287
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,590
mean the process of allocating attention
across time seems to be a really

8288
02:45:51,590 --> 02:45:51,600
across time seems to be a really
 

8289
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:54,870
across time seems to be a really
important process even the breakthroughs

8290
02:45:54,870 --> 02:45:54,880
important process even the breakthroughs
 

8291
02:45:54,880 --> 02:45:58,429
important process even the breakthroughs
that you get with uh with machine

8292
02:45:58,429 --> 02:45:58,439
that you get with uh with machine
 

8293
02:45:58,439 --> 02:46:00,910
that you get with uh with machine
learning mostly has to do attention is

8294
02:46:00,910 --> 02:46:00,920
learning mostly has to do attention is
 

8295
02:46:00,920 --> 02:46:02,630
learning mostly has to do attention is
all you need is about attention

8296
02:46:02,630 --> 02:46:02,640
all you need is about attention
 

8297
02:46:02,640 --> 02:46:04,590
all you need is about attention
transform is about attention so

8298
02:46:04,590 --> 02:46:04,600
transform is about attention so
 

8299
02:46:04,600 --> 02:46:07,389
transform is about attention so
attention is a really interesting one

8300
02:46:07,389 --> 02:46:07,399
attention is a really interesting one
 

8301
02:46:07,399 --> 02:46:11,190
attention is a really interesting one
well then like yeah but how you allocate

8302
02:46:11,190 --> 02:46:11,200
well then like yeah but how you allocate
 

8303
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:15,190
well then like yeah but how you allocate
that attention again is like is at the

8304
02:46:15,190 --> 02:46:15,200
that attention again is like is at the
 

8305
02:46:15,200 --> 02:46:16,550
that attention again is like is at the
core

8306
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:16,560
core
 

8307
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:19,870
core
of like what it means to be intelligent

8308
02:46:19,870 --> 02:46:19,880
of like what it means to be intelligent
 

8309
02:46:19,880 --> 02:46:22,790
of like what it means to be intelligent
what it means to process the world

8310
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:22,800
what it means to process the world
 

8311
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:25,030
what it means to process the world
integrate all the important things

8312
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:25,040
integrate all the important things
 

8313
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:27,670
integrate all the important things
discard all the unimportant

8314
02:46:27,670 --> 02:46:27,680
discard all the unimportant
 

8315
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:31,030
discard all the unimportant
things attention is at the core of it is

8316
02:46:31,030 --> 02:46:31,040
things attention is at the core of it is
 

8317
02:46:31,040 --> 02:46:33,630
things attention is at the core of it is
probably at the core of memory too

8318
02:46:33,630 --> 02:46:33,640
probably at the core of memory too
 

8319
02:46:33,640 --> 02:46:34,910
probably at the core of memory too
because there's so much sensory

8320
02:46:34,910 --> 02:46:34,920
because there's so much sensory
 

8321
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:36,590
because there's so much sensory
information there's so much going on

8322
02:46:36,590 --> 02:46:36,600
information there's so much going on
 

8323
02:46:36,600 --> 02:46:38,309
information there's so much going on
there's so much going on to filter it

8324
02:46:38,309 --> 02:46:38,319
there's so much going on to filter it
 

8325
02:46:38,319 --> 02:46:40,429
there's so much going on to filter it
down to almost nothing and just keep

8326
02:46:40,429 --> 02:46:40,439
down to almost nothing and just keep
 

8327
02:46:40,439 --> 02:46:43,230
down to almost nothing and just keep
those parts and to to keep those parts

8328
02:46:43,230 --> 02:46:43,240
those parts and to to keep those parts
 

8329
02:46:43,240 --> 02:46:45,230
those parts and to to keep those parts
and then whenever there's an error to

8330
02:46:45,230 --> 02:46:45,240
and then whenever there's an error to
 

8331
02:46:45,240 --> 02:46:47,710
and then whenever there's an error to
adjust the model such that you can uh

8332
02:46:47,710 --> 02:46:47,720
adjust the model such that you can uh
 

8333
02:46:47,720 --> 02:46:49,590
adjust the model such that you can uh
allocate attention even better to new

8334
02:46:49,590 --> 02:46:49,600
allocate attention even better to new
 

8335
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:53,590
allocate attention even better to new
things that would result maybe maximize

8336
02:46:53,590 --> 02:46:53,600
things that would result maybe maximize
 

8337
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:55,150
things that would result maybe maximize
the chance of confirming the model or

8338
02:46:55,150 --> 02:46:55,160
the chance of confirming the model or
 

8339
02:46:55,160 --> 02:46:56,630
the chance of confirming the model or
disconfirming the model that you have

8340
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:56,640
disconfirming the model that you have
 

8341
02:46:56,640 --> 02:46:59,070
disconfirming the model that you have
and adjusting it since

8342
02:46:59,070 --> 02:46:59,080
and adjusting it since
 

8343
02:46:59,080 --> 02:47:02,870
and adjusting it since
then yeah attention is a weird one I was

8344
02:47:02,870 --> 02:47:02,880
then yeah attention is a weird one I was
 

8345
02:47:02,880 --> 02:47:04,630
then yeah attention is a weird one I was
I was always fascinated I mean I got a

8346
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:04,640
I was always fascinated I mean I got a
 

8347
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:06,070
I was always fascinated I mean I got a
chance to

8348
02:47:06,070 --> 02:47:06,080
chance to
 

8349
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:09,670
chance to
study peripheral vision for a bit and

8350
02:47:09,670 --> 02:47:09,680
study peripheral vision for a bit and
 

8351
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:11,950
study peripheral vision for a bit and
indirectly study attention through that

8352
02:47:11,950 --> 02:47:11,960
indirectly study attention through that
 

8353
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:14,309
indirectly study attention through that
it's just fascinating how humans how

8354
02:47:14,309 --> 02:47:14,319
it's just fascinating how humans how
 

8355
02:47:14,319 --> 02:47:16,030
it's just fascinating how humans how
good humans are looking around and

8356
02:47:16,030 --> 02:47:16,040
good humans are looking around and
 

8357
02:47:16,040 --> 02:47:16,950
good humans are looking around and
gathering

8358
02:47:16,950 --> 02:47:16,960
gathering
 

8359
02:47:16,960 --> 02:47:19,269
gathering
information yeah at the same time people

8360
02:47:19,269 --> 02:47:19,279
information yeah at the same time people
 

8361
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:22,110
information yeah at the same time people
are terrible at detecting changes that

8362
02:47:22,110 --> 02:47:22,120
are terrible at detecting changes that
 

8363
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:24,110
are terrible at detecting changes that
can happen in the environment if they're

8364
02:47:24,110 --> 02:47:24,120
can happen in the environment if they're
 

8365
02:47:24,120 --> 02:47:26,389
can happen in the environment if they're
not attending in the right way if their

8366
02:47:26,389 --> 02:47:26,399
not attending in the right way if their
 

8367
02:47:26,399 --> 02:47:29,070
not attending in the right way if their
predictive model is too strong you know

8368
02:47:29,070 --> 02:47:29,080
predictive model is too strong you know
 

8369
02:47:29,080 --> 02:47:31,150
predictive model is too strong you know
so you have these weird things where

8370
02:47:31,150 --> 02:47:31,160
so you have these weird things where
 

8371
02:47:31,160 --> 02:47:32,830
so you have these weird things where
like the machines can do better than the

8372
02:47:32,830 --> 02:47:32,840
like the machines can do better than the
 

8373
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:35,190
like the machines can do better than the
people it's not that it's like you know

8374
02:47:35,190 --> 02:47:35,200
people it's not that it's like you know
 

8375
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:36,870
people it's not that it's like you know
so this is the thing is people go oh the

8376
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:36,880
so this is the thing is people go oh the
 

8377
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:38,349
so this is the thing is people go oh the
machines can do this stuff that's just

8378
02:47:38,349 --> 02:47:38,359
machines can do this stuff that's just
 

8379
02:47:38,359 --> 02:47:41,790
machines can do this stuff that's just
like humans it's like well the machines

8380
02:47:41,790 --> 02:47:41,800
like humans it's like well the machines
 

8381
02:47:41,800 --> 02:47:43,910
like humans it's like well the machines
make different kinds of mistakes than

8382
02:47:43,910 --> 02:47:43,920
make different kinds of mistakes than
 

8383
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:46,309
make different kinds of mistakes than
the people do and I will never be

8384
02:47:46,309 --> 02:47:46,319
the people do and I will never be
 

8385
02:47:46,319 --> 02:47:48,950
the people do and I will never be
convinced unless I that you know we've

8386
02:47:48,950 --> 02:47:48,960
convinced unless I that you know we've
 

8387
02:47:48,960 --> 02:47:51,630
convinced unless I that you know we've
replicated human I don't even like the

8388
02:47:51,630 --> 02:47:51,640
replicated human I don't even like the
 

8389
02:47:51,640 --> 02:47:53,190
replicated human I don't even like the
term intelligence because I think it's a

8390
02:47:53,190 --> 02:47:53,200
term intelligence because I think it's a
 

8391
02:47:53,200 --> 02:47:55,870
term intelligence because I think it's a
stupid concept but but it's like I don't

8392
02:47:55,870 --> 02:47:55,880
stupid concept but but it's like I don't
 

8393
02:47:55,880 --> 02:47:57,230
stupid concept but but it's like I don't
think we've replicated human

8394
02:47:57,230 --> 02:47:57,240
think we've replicated human
 

8395
02:47:57,240 --> 02:48:00,550
think we've replicated human
intelligence unless I know that uh the

8396
02:48:00,550 --> 02:48:00,560
intelligence unless I know that uh the
 

8397
02:48:00,560 --> 02:48:03,230
intelligence unless I know that uh the
simulator is making exactly the same

8398
02:48:03,230 --> 02:48:03,240
simulator is making exactly the same
 

8399
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:05,150
simulator is making exactly the same
kinds of mistakes that people do because

8400
02:48:05,150 --> 02:48:05,160
kinds of mistakes that people do because
 

8401
02:48:05,160 --> 02:48:07,630
kinds of mistakes that people do because
people make characteristic mistakes they

8402
02:48:07,630 --> 02:48:07,640
people make characteristic mistakes they
 

8403
02:48:07,640 --> 02:48:09,630
people make characteristic mistakes they
have characteristic biases they have

8404
02:48:09,630 --> 02:48:09,640
have characteristic biases they have
 

8405
02:48:09,640 --> 02:48:12,670
have characteristic biases they have
characteristic like you know heris that

8406
02:48:12,670 --> 02:48:12,680
characteristic like you know heris that
 

8407
02:48:12,680 --> 02:48:15,830
characteristic like you know heris that
we use and those I'm have yet to see

8408
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:15,840
we use and those I'm have yet to see
 

8409
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:18,790
we use and those I'm have yet to see
evidence that chat GPT will do that

8410
02:48:18,790 --> 02:48:18,800
evidence that chat GPT will do that
 

8411
02:48:18,800 --> 02:48:20,830
evidence that chat GPT will do that
since we're talking about

8412
02:48:20,830 --> 02:48:20,840
since we're talking about
 

8413
02:48:20,840 --> 02:48:22,710
since we're talking about
attention is there an interesting

8414
02:48:22,710 --> 02:48:22,720
attention is there an interesting
 

8415
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:25,550
attention is there an interesting
connection to you between ADHD and and

8416
02:48:25,550 --> 02:48:25,560
connection to you between ADHD and and
 

8417
02:48:25,560 --> 02:48:28,550
connection to you between ADHD and and
memory well it's interesting for me

8418
02:48:28,550 --> 02:48:28,560
memory well it's interesting for me
 

8419
02:48:28,560 --> 02:48:30,750
memory well it's interesting for me
because uh when I was a child I was

8420
02:48:30,750 --> 02:48:30,760
because uh when I was a child I was
 

8421
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:33,510
because uh when I was a child I was
actually told my school I don't know if

8422
02:48:33,510 --> 02:48:33,520
actually told my school I don't know if
 

8423
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:35,309
actually told my school I don't know if
it came from a school psychologist they

8424
02:48:35,309 --> 02:48:35,319
it came from a school psychologist they
 

8425
02:48:35,319 --> 02:48:37,790
it came from a school psychologist they
did do some testing on me I know for

8426
02:48:37,790 --> 02:48:37,800
did do some testing on me I know for
 

8427
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:41,110
did do some testing on me I know for
like IQ and stuff like that uh they or

8428
02:48:41,110 --> 02:48:41,120
like IQ and stuff like that uh they or
 

8429
02:48:41,120 --> 02:48:42,790
like IQ and stuff like that uh they or
if it just came from teachers who hated

8430
02:48:42,790 --> 02:48:42,800
if it just came from teachers who hated
 

8431
02:48:42,800 --> 02:48:45,790
if it just came from teachers who hated
me but they told my parents that I had

8432
02:48:45,790 --> 02:48:45,800
me but they told my parents that I had
 

8433
02:48:45,800 --> 02:48:48,269
me but they told my parents that I had
ADHD and so this was of course in the'

8434
02:48:48,269 --> 02:48:48,279
ADHD and so this was of course in the'
 

8435
02:48:48,279 --> 02:48:51,269
ADHD and so this was of course in the'
70s so basically they said like you know

8436
02:48:51,269 --> 02:48:51,279
70s so basically they said like you know
 

8437
02:48:51,279 --> 02:48:53,830
70s so basically they said like you know
he has poor motor control and he's got

8438
02:48:53,830 --> 02:48:53,840
he has poor motor control and he's got
 

8439
02:48:53,840 --> 02:48:56,950
he has poor motor control and he's got
ADHD and so and you know there was

8440
02:48:56,950 --> 02:48:56,960
ADHD and so and you know there was
 

8441
02:48:56,960 --> 02:48:58,950
ADHD and so and you know there was
social issues so like I could have been

8442
02:48:58,950 --> 02:48:58,960
social issues so like I could have been
 

8443
02:48:58,960 --> 02:49:01,389
social issues so like I could have been
put a year ahead in school but then they

8444
02:49:01,389 --> 02:49:01,399
put a year ahead in school but then they
 

8445
02:49:01,399 --> 02:49:03,830
put a year ahead in school but then they
said oh but he doesn't have the social

8446
02:49:03,830 --> 02:49:03,840
said oh but he doesn't have the social
 

8447
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:05,389
said oh but he doesn't have the social
in he doesn't have the social

8448
02:49:05,389 --> 02:49:05,399
in he doesn't have the social
 

8449
02:49:05,399 --> 02:49:07,469
in he doesn't have the social
capabilities right so I still ended up

8450
02:49:07,469 --> 02:49:07,479
capabilities right so I still ended up
 

8451
02:49:07,479 --> 02:49:10,830
capabilities right so I still ended up
being like you know an outcast even in

8452
02:49:10,830 --> 02:49:10,840
being like you know an outcast even in
 

8453
02:49:10,840 --> 02:49:14,590
being like you know an outcast even in
my own grade but um but then like uh I

8454
02:49:14,590 --> 02:49:14,600
my own grade but um but then like uh I
 

8455
02:49:14,600 --> 02:49:16,790
my own grade but um but then like uh I
so then my parents said okay well they

8456
02:49:16,790 --> 02:49:16,800
so then my parents said okay well they
 

8457
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:19,110
so then my parents said okay well they
got me on a diet free of Art AR official

8458
02:49:19,110 --> 02:49:19,120
got me on a diet free of Art AR official
 

8459
02:49:19,120 --> 02:49:21,030
got me on a diet free of Art AR official
colors and flavors because that was the

8460
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:21,040
colors and flavors because that was the
 

8461
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:22,790
colors and flavors because that was the
thing that people talked about back then

8462
02:49:22,790 --> 02:49:22,800
thing that people talked about back then
 

8463
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:24,990
thing that people talked about back then
so so I am interested in this topic

8464
02:49:24,990 --> 02:49:25,000
so so I am interested in this topic
 

8465
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,870
so so I am interested in this topic
because I've come to appreciate now that

8466
02:49:27,870 --> 02:49:27,880
because I've come to appreciate now that
 

8467
02:49:27,880 --> 02:49:30,030
because I've come to appreciate now that
I have many of the characteristics if

8468
02:49:30,030 --> 02:49:30,040
I have many of the characteristics if
 

8469
02:49:30,040 --> 02:49:31,990
I have many of the characteristics if
not you know full-blown it's like I'm

8470
02:49:31,990 --> 02:49:32,000
not you know full-blown it's like I'm
 

8471
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:33,510
not you know full-blown it's like I'm
definitely

8472
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:33,520
definitely
 

8473
02:49:33,520 --> 02:49:36,950
definitely
Timeless uh rejection s you name it they

8474
02:49:36,950 --> 02:49:36,960
Timeless uh rejection s you name it they
 

8475
02:49:36,960 --> 02:49:38,750
Timeless uh rejection s you name it they
talk about it it's like impulsive

8476
02:49:38,750 --> 02:49:38,760
talk about it it's like impulsive
 

8477
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:40,229
talk about it it's like impulsive
behavior I could tell you about all

8478
02:49:40,229 --> 02:49:40,239
behavior I could tell you about all
 

8479
02:49:40,239 --> 02:49:42,110
behavior I could tell you about all
sorts of fights I've gotten into in the

8480
02:49:42,110 --> 02:49:42,120
sorts of fights I've gotten into in the
 

8481
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:46,910
sorts of fights I've gotten into in the
past just you name it um uh but yeah so

8482
02:49:46,910 --> 02:49:46,920
past just you name it um uh but yeah so
 

8483
02:49:46,920 --> 02:49:49,229
past just you name it um uh but yeah so
ADHD is fascinating though because right

8484
02:49:49,229 --> 02:49:49,239
ADHD is fascinating though because right
 

8485
02:49:49,239 --> 02:49:51,349
ADHD is fascinating though because right
now we're seeing like more and more

8486
02:49:51,349 --> 02:49:51,359
now we're seeing like more and more
 

8487
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:54,190
now we're seeing like more and more
diagnosis of it and I don't know what to

8488
02:49:54,190 --> 02:49:54,200
diagnosis of it and I don't know what to
 

8489
02:49:54,200 --> 02:49:56,790
diagnosis of it and I don't know what to
say about that I don't know how much of

8490
02:49:56,790 --> 02:49:56,800
say about that I don't know how much of
 

8491
02:49:56,800 --> 02:50:01,269
say about that I don't know how much of
that is um based on kind of

8492
02:50:01,269 --> 02:50:01,279
that is um based on kind of
 

8493
02:50:01,279 --> 02:50:03,429
that is um based on kind of
inappropriate expectations especially

8494
02:50:03,429 --> 02:50:03,439
inappropriate expectations especially
 

8495
02:50:03,439 --> 02:50:05,630
inappropriate expectations especially
for children and how much of that is

8496
02:50:05,630 --> 02:50:05,640
for children and how much of that is
 

8497
02:50:05,640 --> 02:50:08,150
for children and how much of that is
based on true kind of like maladaptive

8498
02:50:08,150 --> 02:50:08,160
based on true kind of like maladaptive
 

8499
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:11,229
based on true kind of like maladaptive
kinds of uh Tendencies but what we do

8500
02:50:11,229 --> 02:50:11,239
kinds of uh Tendencies but what we do
 

8501
02:50:11,239 --> 02:50:13,790
kinds of uh Tendencies but what we do
know is this is that ADHD is associated

8502
02:50:13,790 --> 02:50:13,800
know is this is that ADHD is associated
 

8503
02:50:13,800 --> 02:50:16,870
know is this is that ADHD is associated
with differences in prefrontal function

8504
02:50:16,870 --> 02:50:16,880
with differences in prefrontal function
 

8505
02:50:16,880 --> 02:50:20,510
with differences in prefrontal function
so that attention can be both more

8506
02:50:20,510 --> 02:50:20,520
so that attention can be both more
 

8507
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:22,590
so that attention can be both more
you're more distractable you have harder

8508
02:50:22,590 --> 02:50:22,600
you're more distractable you have harder
 

8509
02:50:22,600 --> 02:50:24,510
you're more distractable you have harder
time focusing your attention on what's

8510
02:50:24,510 --> 02:50:24,520
time focusing your attention on what's
 

8511
02:50:24,520 --> 02:50:26,870
time focusing your attention on what's
relevant and so you shift too easily but

8512
02:50:26,870 --> 02:50:26,880
relevant and so you shift too easily but
 

8513
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:28,190
relevant and so you shift too easily but
then once you get on something that

8514
02:50:28,190 --> 02:50:28,200
then once you get on something that
 

8515
02:50:28,200 --> 02:50:30,950
then once you get on something that
you're interested in you can get stuck

8516
02:50:30,950 --> 02:50:30,960
you're interested in you can get stuck
 

8517
02:50:30,960 --> 02:50:32,990
you're interested in you can get stuck
and so you know the attention is this

8518
02:50:32,990 --> 02:50:33,000
and so you know the attention is this
 

8519
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:36,429
and so you know the attention is this
beautiful balance of being able to focus

8520
02:50:36,429 --> 02:50:36,439
beautiful balance of being able to focus
 

8521
02:50:36,439 --> 02:50:38,229
beautiful balance of being able to focus
when you need to focus and shift when

8522
02:50:38,229 --> 02:50:38,239
when you need to focus and shift when
 

8523
02:50:38,239 --> 02:50:40,630
when you need to focus and shift when
you need to shift and so it's that

8524
02:50:40,630 --> 02:50:40,640
you need to shift and so it's that
 

8525
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:44,590
you need to shift and so it's that
flexibility plus stability again um and

8526
02:50:44,590 --> 02:50:44,600
flexibility plus stability again um and
 

8527
02:50:44,600 --> 02:50:47,389
flexibility plus stability again um and
that balance seems to be disrupted in

8528
02:50:47,389 --> 02:50:47,399
that balance seems to be disrupted in
 

8529
02:50:47,399 --> 02:50:50,790
that balance seems to be disrupted in
ADHD and so as a result memory tends to

8530
02:50:50,790 --> 02:50:50,800
ADHD and so as a result memory tends to
 

8531
02:50:50,800 --> 02:50:53,950
ADHD and so as a result memory tends to
be poor in ADHD but it's not necessarily

8532
02:50:53,950 --> 02:50:53,960
be poor in ADHD but it's not necessarily
 

8533
02:50:53,960 --> 02:50:55,950
be poor in ADHD but it's not necessarily
because there's a traditional memory

8534
02:50:55,950 --> 02:50:55,960
because there's a traditional memory
 

8535
02:50:55,960 --> 02:50:59,070
because there's a traditional memory
problem but it's more because of this

8536
02:50:59,070 --> 02:50:59,080
problem but it's more because of this
 

8537
02:50:59,080 --> 02:51:03,030
problem but it's more because of this
attentional issue right and so um and

8538
02:51:03,030 --> 02:51:03,040
attentional issue right and so um and
 

8539
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:04,870
attentional issue right and so um and
people with ADHD often will have great

8540
02:51:04,870 --> 02:51:04,880
people with ADHD often will have great
 

8541
02:51:04,880 --> 02:51:06,950
people with ADHD often will have great
memory for the things that they're

8542
02:51:06,950 --> 02:51:06,960
memory for the things that they're
 

8543
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:09,750
memory for the things that they're

blocking these things off you give
 

8627
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:56,469
blocking these things off you give
yourself the goofing off time sometimes

8628
02:52:56,469 --> 02:52:56,479
yourself the goofing off time sometimes
 

8629
02:52:56,479 --> 02:52:58,910
yourself the goofing off time sometimes
I do that I and I sometimes I have to be

8698
02:54:19,790 --> 02:54:19,800
you look at people and you can speak
 

8699
02:54:19,800 --> 02:54:22,110
you look at people and you can speak
from a little bit of personal experience

8700
02:54:22,110 --> 02:54:22,120
from a little bit of personal experience
 

8701
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:24,830
from a little bit of personal experience
is you're checking email and you're like

8702
02:54:24,830 --> 02:54:24,840
is you're checking email and you're like
 

8703
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:27,269
is you're checking email and you're like
uh uh or I'm working on my own talk but

8704
02:54:27,269 --> 02:54:27,279
uh uh or I'm working on my own talk but
 

8705
02:54:27,279 --> 02:54:28,990
uh uh or I'm working on my own talk but
often it's like you're doing things that

8706
02:54:28,990 --> 02:54:29,000
often it's like you're doing things that
 

8707
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,550
often it's like you're doing things that
are not paying and I have this illusion

8708
02:54:31,550 --> 02:54:31,560
are not paying and I have this illusion
 

8709
02:54:31,560 --> 02:54:32,950
are not paying and I have this illusion
well I'm paying attention and then I'm

8710
02:54:32,950 --> 02:54:32,960
well I'm paying attention and then I'm
 

8711
02:54:32,960 --> 02:54:34,910
well I'm paying attention and then I'm
going back and and then what happens is

8712
02:54:34,910 --> 02:54:34,920
going back and and then what happens is
 

8713
02:54:34,920 --> 02:54:37,309
going back and and then what happens is
I don't remember anything from that day

8714
02:54:37,309 --> 02:54:37,319
I don't remember anything from that day
 

8715
02:54:37,319 --> 02:54:38,910
I don't remember anything from that day
it just kind of vanished because what

8716
02:54:38,910 --> 02:54:38,920
it just kind of vanished because what
 

8717
02:54:38,920 --> 02:54:40,870
it just kind of vanished because what
happens is I'm creating all these

8718
02:54:40,870 --> 02:54:40,880
happens is I'm creating all these
 

8719
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:43,670
happens is I'm creating all these
artificial event boundaries I'm losing

8720
02:54:43,670 --> 02:54:43,680
artificial event boundaries I'm losing
 

8721
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:46,510
artificial event boundaries I'm losing
all this executive function every time I

8722
02:54:46,510 --> 02:54:46,520
all this executive function every time I
 

8723
02:54:46,520 --> 02:54:49,110
all this executive function every time I
switch I'm getting like a few seconds

8724
02:54:49,110 --> 02:54:49,120
switch I'm getting like a few seconds
 

8725
02:54:49,120 --> 02:54:51,710
switch I'm getting like a few seconds
slower and I'm catching up mentally to

8726
02:54:51,710 --> 02:54:51,720
slower and I'm catching up mentally to
 

8727
02:54:51,720 --> 02:54:54,190
slower and I'm catching up mentally to
what's happening and so instead of being

8728
02:54:54,190 --> 02:54:54,200
what's happening and so instead of being
 

8729
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:56,110
what's happening and so instead of being
in a model where you're meaningfully

8730
02:54:56,110 --> 02:54:56,120
in a model where you're meaningfully
 

8731
02:54:56,120 --> 02:54:57,830
in a model where you're meaningfully
integrating everything and predicting

8732
02:54:57,830 --> 02:54:57,840
integrating everything and predicting
 

8733
02:54:57,840 --> 02:54:59,710
integrating everything and predicting
and generating this kind of like Rich

8734
02:54:59,710 --> 02:54:59,720
and generating this kind of like Rich
 

8735
02:54:59,720 --> 02:55:03,349
and generating this kind of like Rich
model I'm just catching up you know and

8736
02:55:03,349 --> 02:55:03,359
model I'm just catching up you know and
 

8737
02:55:03,359 --> 02:55:05,550
model I'm just catching up you know and
so yeah there's great research by Molina

8738
02:55:05,550 --> 02:55:05,560
so yeah there's great research by Molina
 

8739
02:55:05,560 --> 02:55:07,429
so yeah there's great research by Molina
uner and and Anthony Wagner on

8740
02:55:07,429 --> 02:55:07,439
uner and and Anthony Wagner on
 

8741
02:55:07,439 --> 02:55:09,349

multitasking that people can look up

8742
02:55:09,349 --> 02:55:09,359
multitasking that people can look up
 

8743
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:11,670
multitasking that people can look up
that talks about just how bad it is for

8744
02:55:11,670 --> 02:55:11,680
that talks about just how bad it is for
 

8745
02:55:11,680 --> 02:55:13,790
that talks about just how bad it is for
memory and and you know it's it's

8746
02:55:13,790 --> 02:55:13,800
memory and and you know it's it's
 

8747
02:55:13,800 --> 02:55:16,389
memory and and you know it's it's
becoming worse and worse of a problem so

8748
02:55:16,389 --> 02:55:16,399
becoming worse and worse of a problem so
 

8749
02:55:16,399 --> 02:55:18,790
becoming worse and worse of a problem so
uh you're a musician take take me

8750
02:55:18,790 --> 02:55:18,800
uh you're a musician take take me
 

8751

uh you're a musician take take me
through uh how'd you get into music like

what what made you first fall in love
 

8755
02:55:22,279 --> 02:55:25,309
what what made you first fall in love
with music with uh creating music I yeah

8756
02:55:25,309 --> 02:55:25,319
with music with uh creating music I yeah
 

8757
02:55:25,319 --> 02:55:27,750
with music with uh creating music I yeah
so I started playing music just when I

so I started playing music just when I
was like doing trumpet in school um for

music and play and you know it was
pretty decent at it not great but it was

8766
02:55:37,030 --> 02:55:37,040
pretty decent at it not great but it was

pretty decent at it not great but it was
decent how'd you go from trumpet to uh

don't I play guitar I can do this and I
 

8811
02:56:38,120 --> 02:56:40,910
don't I play guitar I can do this and I
had friends who were doing that and I

8812
02:56:40,910 --> 02:56:40,920
had friends who were doing that and I
 

8813
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:43,269
had friends who were doing that and I
just never got it like I was I took

8814
02:56:43,269 --> 02:56:43,279
just never got it like I was I took
 

8815
02:56:43,279 --> 02:56:45,349
just never got it like I was I took
lessons and stuff like that but it was

8816
02:56:45,349 --> 02:56:45,359
lessons and stuff like that but it was
 

8817
02:56:45,359 --> 02:56:47,389
lessons and stuff like that but it was
different because in when I was doing

8818
02:56:47,389 --> 02:56:47,399
different because in when I was doing
 

8819
02:56:47,399 --> 02:56:49,429
different because in when I was doing
trumpet I was reading sheet music and

8820
02:56:49,429 --> 02:56:49,439
trumpet I was reading sheet music and
 

8821
02:56:49,439 --> 02:56:51,910
trumpet I was reading sheet music and
this was like I was learning by looking

8822
02:56:51,910 --> 02:56:51,920
this was like I was learning by looking
 

8823
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:53,229
this was like I was learning by looking
there's a thing called tablature you

8824
02:56:53,229 --> 02:56:53,239
there's a thing called tablature you
 

8825
02:56:53,239 --> 02:56:55,349
there's a thing called tablature you
know this where it's like you see like a

8826
02:56:55,349 --> 02:56:55,359
know this where it's like you see like a
 

8827
02:56:55,359 --> 02:56:57,630
know this where it's like you see like a
drawing of the fretboard with numbers

8828
02:56:57,630 --> 02:56:57,640
drawing of the fretboard with numbers
 

8829
02:56:57,640 --> 02:56:58,630
drawing of the fretboard with numbers
and that's where you're supposed to put

8830
02:56:58,630 --> 02:56:58,640
and that's where you're supposed to put
 

8831
02:56:58,640 --> 02:57:00,190
and that's where you're supposed to put
your it's kind of like paint by numbers

8832
02:57:00,190 --> 02:57:00,200
your it's kind of like paint by numbers
 

8833
02:57:00,200 --> 02:57:04,349
your it's kind of like paint by numbers
right and so um I learned it in a

8834
02:57:04,349 --> 02:57:04,359
right and so um I learned it in a
 

8835
02:57:04,359 --> 02:57:06,229
right and so um I learned it in a
completely different way but I was still

8836
02:57:06,229 --> 02:57:06,239
completely different way but I was still
 

8837
02:57:06,239 --> 02:57:10,269
completely different way but I was still
terrible at it and I didn't get it it

8838
02:57:10,269 --> 02:57:10,279
terrible at it and I didn't get it it
 

8839
02:57:10,279 --> 02:57:11,790
terrible at it and I didn't get it it
it's actually taken me a long time to

8840
02:57:11,790 --> 02:57:11,800
it's actually taken me a long time to
 

8841
02:57:11,800 --> 02:57:13,469
it's actually taken me a long time to
understand exactly what the issue was

8842
02:57:13,469 --> 02:57:13,479
understand exactly what the issue was
 

8843
02:57:13,479 --> 02:57:15,830
understand exactly what the issue was
but it wasn't until I really got into

8844
02:57:15,830 --> 02:57:15,840
but it wasn't until I really got into
 

8845
02:57:15,840 --> 02:57:18,229
but it wasn't until I really got into
Punk and I saw bands like I saw Sonic

8846
02:57:18,229 --> 02:57:18,239
Punk and I saw bands like I saw Sonic
 

8847
02:57:18,239 --> 02:57:19,990
Punk and I saw bands like I saw Sonic
youth I remember especially and it just

8848
02:57:19,990 --> 02:57:20,000
youth I remember especially and it just
 

8849
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:23,510
youth I remember especially and it just
blew my mind because they violated the

8850
02:57:23,510 --> 02:57:23,520
blew my mind because they violated the
 

8851
02:57:23,520 --> 02:57:25,229
blew my mind because they violated the
rules of what I thought music was

8852
02:57:25,229 --> 02:57:25,239
rules of what I thought music was
 

8853
02:57:25,239 --> 02:57:27,590
rules of what I thought music was
supposed to be I was like this doesn't

8854
02:57:27,590 --> 02:57:27,600
supposed to be I was like this doesn't
 

8855
02:57:27,600 --> 02:57:30,469
supposed to be I was like this doesn't
sound right these are not power chords

8856
02:57:30,469 --> 02:57:30,479
sound right these are not power chords
 

8857
02:57:30,479 --> 02:57:32,950
sound right these are not power chords
and this isn't just have like a shouty

8858
02:57:32,950 --> 02:57:32,960
and this isn't just have like a shouty
 

8859
02:57:32,960 --> 02:57:34,910
and this isn't just have like a shouty
verse and then a chorus part it's not

8860
02:57:34,910 --> 02:57:34,920
verse and then a chorus part it's not
 

8861
02:57:34,920 --> 02:57:38,670
verse and then a chorus part it's not
going this is just like weird and then

8862
02:57:38,670 --> 02:57:38,680
going this is just like weird and then
 

8863
02:57:38,680 --> 02:57:40,910
going this is just like weird and then
it occurred to me you don't have to

8864
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:40,920
it occurred to me you don't have to
 

8865
02:57:40,920 --> 02:57:44,510
it occurred to me you don't have to
write music the way it's people tell you

8866
02:57:44,510 --> 02:57:44,520
write music the way it's people tell you
 

8867
02:57:44,520 --> 02:57:46,670
write music the way it's people tell you
it's supposed to sound that just opened

8868
02:57:46,670 --> 02:57:46,680
it's supposed to sound that just opened
 

8869
02:57:46,680 --> 02:57:47,950
it's supposed to sound that just opened
up everything for me and I was playing

8870
02:57:47,950 --> 02:57:47,960
up everything for me and I was playing
 

8871
02:57:47,960 --> 02:57:50,630
up everything for me and I was playing
it a band and I was struggling with

8872
02:57:50,630 --> 02:57:50,640
it a band and I was struggling with
 

8873
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:52,389
it a band and I was struggling with
writing music because I would try to

8874
02:57:52,389 --> 02:57:52,399
writing music because I would try to
 

8875
02:57:52,399 --> 02:57:55,469
writing music because I would try to
write like you know whatever was popular

8876
02:57:55,469 --> 02:57:55,479
write like you know whatever was popular
 

8877
02:57:55,479 --> 02:57:58,110
write like you know whatever was popular
at the time and or whatever sounded like

8878
02:57:58,110 --> 02:57:58,120
at the time and or whatever sounded like
 

8879
02:57:58,120 --> 02:58:00,309
at the time and or whatever sounded like
other bands that I was listening to and

8880
02:58:00,309 --> 02:58:00,319
other bands that I was listening to and
 

8881
02:58:00,319 --> 02:58:03,389
other bands that I was listening to and
somehow I kind of morphed into just like

8882
02:58:03,389 --> 02:58:03,399
somehow I kind of morphed into just like
 

8883
02:58:03,399 --> 02:58:05,670
somehow I kind of morphed into just like
just grabbing a guitar and just doing

8884
02:58:05,670 --> 02:58:05,680
just grabbing a guitar and just doing
 

8885
02:58:05,680 --> 02:58:08,469
just grabbing a guitar and just doing
stuff and I realized part of my problem

8886
02:58:08,469 --> 02:58:08,479
stuff and I realized part of my problem
 

8887
02:58:08,479 --> 02:58:11,150
stuff and I realized part of my problem
with doing music before was I didn't

8888
02:58:11,150 --> 02:58:11,160
with doing music before was I didn't
 

8889
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:13,110
with doing music before was I didn't
enjoy trying to play stuff that other

8890
02:58:13,110 --> 02:58:13,120
enjoy trying to play stuff that other
 

8891
02:58:13,120 --> 02:58:15,510
enjoy trying to play stuff that other
people played I just enjoyed music just

8892
02:58:15,510 --> 02:58:15,520
people played I just enjoyed music just
 

8893
02:58:15,520 --> 02:58:17,349
people played I just enjoyed music just
dripping out of me and and just you know

8894
02:58:17,349 --> 02:58:17,359
dripping out of me and and just you know
 

8895
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:20,870
dripping out of me and and just you know
spilling out just doing stuff and so

8896
02:58:20,870 --> 02:58:20,880
spilling out just doing stuff and so
 

8897
02:58:20,880 --> 02:58:22,429
spilling out just doing stuff and so
then I started to say what if I don't

8898
02:58:22,429 --> 02:58:22,439
then I started to say what if I don't
 

8899
02:58:22,439 --> 02:58:24,990
then I started to say what if I don't
play a chord what if I just play like

8900
02:58:24,990 --> 02:58:25,000
play a chord what if I just play like
 

8901
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:26,910
play a chord what if I just play like
notes that shouldn't go together and

8902
02:58:26,910 --> 02:58:26,920
notes that shouldn't go together and
 

8903
02:58:26,920 --> 02:58:29,030
notes that shouldn't go together and
just mess around with stuff and I said

8904
02:58:29,030 --> 02:58:29,040
just mess around with stuff and I said
 

8905
02:58:29,040 --> 02:58:31,269
just mess around with stuff and I said
well what if I don't do four beats go n

8906
02:58:31,269 --> 02:58:31,279
well what if I don't do four beats go n
 

8907
02:58:31,279 --> 02:58:34,590
well what if I don't do four beats go n
n n n one 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 what if

8908
02:58:34,590 --> 02:58:34,600
n n n one 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 what if
 

8909
02:58:34,600 --> 02:58:38,429
n n n one 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 what if
I go 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 five and started

8910
02:58:38,429 --> 02:58:38,439
I go 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 five and started
 

8911
02:58:38,439 --> 02:58:39,750
I go 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 five and started
messing around time signatures then I

8912
02:58:39,750 --> 02:58:39,760
messing around time signatures then I
 

8913
02:58:39,760 --> 02:58:42,710
messing around time signatures then I
was playing um in this band with the

8914
02:58:42,710 --> 02:58:42,720
was playing um in this band with the
 

8915
02:58:42,720 --> 02:58:45,030
was playing um in this band with the
great musician who was really Brent

8916
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:45,040
great musician who was really Brent
 

8917
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:46,910
great musician who was really Brent
ritell who was in this band with me and

8918
02:58:46,910 --> 02:58:46,920
ritell who was in this band with me and
 

8919
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:49,190
ritell who was in this band with me and
he taught me about arranging songs and

8920
02:58:49,190 --> 02:58:49,200
he taught me about arranging songs and
 

8921
02:58:49,200 --> 02:58:51,190
he taught me about arranging songs and
it was like What if we take this part

8922
02:58:51,190 --> 02:58:51,200
it was like What if we take this part
 

8923
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:53,070
it was like What if we take this part
and instead of make it go like back and

8924
02:58:53,070 --> 02:58:53,080
and instead of make it go like back and
 

8925
02:58:53,080 --> 02:58:55,389
and instead of make it go like back and
forth we make it like a circle or what

8926
02:58:55,389 --> 02:58:55,399
forth we make it like a circle or what
 

8927
02:58:55,399 --> 02:58:57,790
forth we make it like a circle or what
if we make it like a straight line you

8928
02:58:57,790 --> 02:58:57,800
if we make it like a straight line you
 

8929
02:58:57,800 --> 02:59:00,070
if we make it like a straight line you
know or zigzag you know just make it

8930
02:59:00,070 --> 02:59:00,080
know or zigzag you know just make it
 

8931
02:59:00,080 --> 02:59:03,389
know or zigzag you know just make it
like nonlinear in these interesting ways

8932
02:59:03,389 --> 02:59:03,399
like nonlinear in these interesting ways
 

8933
02:59:03,399 --> 02:59:04,590
like nonlinear in these interesting ways
and then next thing you know it's like

8934
02:59:04,590 --> 02:59:04,600
and then next thing you know it's like
 

8935
02:59:04,600 --> 02:59:07,429
and then next thing you know it's like
the whole world sort of opens up as like

8936
02:59:07,429 --> 02:59:07,439
the whole world sort of opens up as like
 

8937
02:59:07,439 --> 02:59:09,630
the whole world sort of opens up as like
the and then what I started to realize

8938
02:59:09,630 --> 02:59:09,640
the and then what I started to realize
 

8939
02:59:09,640 --> 02:59:11,150
the and then what I started to realize
especially so you could appreciate this

8940
02:59:11,150 --> 02:59:11,160
especially so you could appreciate this
 

8941
02:59:11,160 --> 02:59:13,469
especially so you could appreciate this
as a musician I think so time signatures

8942
02:59:13,469 --> 02:59:13,479
as a musician I think so time signatures
 

8943
02:59:13,479 --> 02:59:16,510
as a musician I think so time signatures
right so we are so brainwashed to think

8944
02:59:16,510 --> 02:59:16,520
right so we are so brainwashed to think
 

8945
02:59:16,520 --> 02:59:19,190
right so we are so brainwashed to think
in 44 right every rock song you can

8946
02:59:19,190 --> 02:59:19,200
in 44 right every rock song you can
 

8947
02:59:19,200 --> 02:59:21,389
in 44 right every rock song you can
think of almost is in 44 I know you're a

8948
02:59:21,389 --> 02:59:21,399
think of almost is in 44 I know you're a
 

8949
02:59:21,399 --> 02:59:24,030
think of almost is in 44 I know you're a
Floyd fan so think of Money by Pink

8950
02:59:24,030 --> 02:59:24,040
Floyd fan so think of Money by Pink
 

8951
02:59:24,040 --> 02:59:28,349
Floyd fan so think of Money by Pink
Floyd right

8952
02:59:28,349 --> 02:59:28,359

 

8953
02:59:28,359 --> 02:59:31,550

yeah yeah you feel like it's in 44

8954
02:59:31,550 --> 02:59:31,560
yeah yeah you feel like it's in 44
 

8955
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:33,870
yeah yeah you feel like it's in 44
because it resolves itself but it

8956
02:59:33,870 --> 02:59:33,880
because it resolves itself but it
 

8957
02:59:33,880 --> 02:59:37,070
because it resolves itself but it
resolves on the the last note of the

8958
02:59:37,070 --> 02:59:37,080
resolves on the the last note of the
 

8959
02:59:37,080 --> 02:59:39,229
resolves on the the last note of the
basically it resolves on the first note

8960
02:59:39,229 --> 02:59:39,239
basically it resolves on the first note
 

8961
02:59:39,239 --> 02:59:41,790
basically it resolves on the first note
of the next measure so it's got seven

8962
02:59:41,790 --> 02:59:41,800
of the next measure so it's got seven
 

8963
02:59:41,800 --> 02:59:43,870
of the next measure so it's got seven
beats instead of eight where the Riff is

8964
02:59:43,870 --> 02:59:43,880
beats instead of eight where the Riff is
 

8965
02:59:43,880 --> 02:59:45,750
beats instead of eight where the Riff is
actually happening interesting but

8966
02:59:45,750 --> 02:59:45,760
actually happening interesting but
 

8967
02:59:45,760 --> 02:59:48,229
actually happening interesting but
you're thinking in four because that's

8968
02:59:48,229 --> 02:59:48,239
you're thinking in four because that's
 

8969
02:59:48,239 --> 02:59:49,990
you're thinking in four because that's
how we used we're used to thinking so

8970
02:59:49,990 --> 02:59:50,000
how we used we're used to thinking so
 

8971
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:53,190
how we used we're used to thinking so
the music flows a little bit faster than

8972
02:59:53,190 --> 02:59:53,200
the music flows a little bit faster than
 

8973
02:59:53,200 --> 02:59:55,429
the music flows a little bit faster than
it's supposed to and you're getting a

8974
02:59:55,429 --> 02:59:55,439
it's supposed to and you're getting a
 

8975
02:59:55,439 --> 02:59:57,429
it's supposed to and you're getting a
little bit of prediction error every

8976
02:59:57,429 --> 02:59:57,439
little bit of prediction error every
 

8977
02:59:57,439 --> 03:00:00,269
little bit of prediction error every
time this is happening and once I got

8978
03:00:00,269 --> 03:00:00,279
time this is happening and once I got
 

8979
03:00:00,279 --> 03:00:02,349
time this is happening and once I got
used to that I was like I hate writing

8980
03:00:02,349 --> 03:00:02,359
used to that I was like I hate writing
 

8981
03:00:02,359 --> 03:00:04,229
used to that I was like I hate writing
in 44 because I was like everything just

8982
03:00:04,229 --> 03:00:04,239
in 44 because I was like everything just
 

8983
03:00:04,239 --> 03:00:07,070
in 44 because I was like everything just
feels better if I do it in seven4 if I

8984
03:00:07,070 --> 03:00:07,080
feels better if I do it in seven4 if I
 

8985
03:00:07,080 --> 03:00:09,510
feels better if I do it in seven4 if I
alternate between four and three and and

8986
03:00:09,510 --> 03:00:09,520
alternate between four and three and and
 

8987
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:11,429
alternate between four and three and and
doing all this stuff and then it's like

8988
03:00:11,429 --> 03:00:11,439
doing all this stuff and then it's like
 

8989
03:00:11,439 --> 03:00:13,950
doing all this stuff and then it's like
you just and you jazz music is like that

8990
03:00:13,950 --> 03:00:13,960
you just and you jazz music is like that
 

8991
03:00:13,960 --> 03:00:15,309
you just and you jazz music is like that
you know they just do so much

8992
03:00:15,309 --> 03:00:15,319
you know they just do so much
 

8993
03:00:15,319 --> 03:00:17,510
you know they just do so much
interesting stuff with us and so playing

8994
03:00:17,510 --> 03:00:17,520
interesting stuff with us and so playing
 

8995
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:19,269
interesting stuff with us and so playing
with those signatures allows you to like

8996
03:00:19,269 --> 03:00:19,279
with those signatures allows you to like
 

8997
03:00:19,279 --> 03:00:22,110
with those signatures allows you to like
really break it all open and just I

8998
03:00:22,110 --> 03:00:22,120
really break it all open and just I
 

8999
03:00:22,120 --> 03:00:23,630
really break it all open and just I
guess there's something about that where

9000
03:00:23,630 --> 03:00:23,640
guess there's something about that where
 

9001
03:00:23,640 --> 03:00:26,110
guess there's something about that where
it allows you to actually have fun yeah

9002
03:00:26,110 --> 03:00:26,120
it allows you to actually have fun yeah
 

9003
03:00:26,120 --> 03:00:28,110
it allows you to actually have fun yeah
yeah and it's like so I'm actually like

9004
03:00:28,110 --> 03:00:28,120
yeah and it's like so I'm actually like
 

9005
03:00:28,120 --> 03:00:29,349
yeah and it's like so I'm actually like
a

9006
03:00:29,349 --> 03:00:29,359
a
 

9007
03:00:29,359 --> 03:00:32,190
a
very the Gen the one of the genres we

9008
03:00:32,190 --> 03:00:32,200
very the Gen the one of the genres we
 

9009
03:00:32,200 --> 03:00:33,910
very the Gen the one of the genres we
used to play in was math rock is what

9010
03:00:33,910 --> 03:00:33,920
used to play in was math rock is what
 

9011
03:00:33,920 --> 03:00:35,469
used to play in was math rock is what
they called it which is like this is so

9012
03:00:35,469 --> 03:00:35,479
they called it which is like this is so
 

9013
03:00:35,479 --> 03:00:37,590
they called it which is like this is so
many weird time sign what is math oh

9014
03:00:37,590 --> 03:00:37,600
many weird time sign what is math oh
 

9015
03:00:37,600 --> 03:00:40,070
many weird time sign what is math oh
interesting yeah so that's that's the

9016
03:00:40,070 --> 03:00:40,080
interesting yeah so that's that's the
 

9017
03:00:40,080 --> 03:00:43,349
interesting yeah so that's that's the
math part of rock is what the the ma

9018
03:00:43,349 --> 03:00:43,359
math part of rock is what the the ma
 

9019
03:00:43,359 --> 03:00:45,309
math part of rock is what the the ma
mathematical disturbances of it or what

9020
03:00:45,309 --> 03:00:45,319
mathematical disturbances of it or what
 

9021
03:00:45,319 --> 03:00:46,710
mathematical disturbances of it or what
yeah I guess it would be like so instead

9022
03:00:46,710 --> 03:00:46,720
yeah I guess it would be like so instead
 

9023
03:00:46,720 --> 03:00:48,229
yeah I guess it would be like so instead
of you might go like and instead of

9024
03:00:48,229 --> 03:00:48,239
of you might go like and instead of
 

9025
03:00:48,239 --> 03:00:50,590
of you might go like and instead of
playing four beats in every measure no

9026
03:00:50,590 --> 03:00:50,600
playing four beats in every measure no
 

9027
03:00:50,600 --> 03:00:53,550
playing four beats in every measure no
no no no no no no no you go no no no no

9028
03:00:53,550 --> 03:00:53,560
no no no no no no no you go no no no no
 

9029
03:00:53,560 --> 03:00:57,030
no no no no no no no you go no no no no
no no no no you know just do these

9030
03:00:57,030 --> 03:00:57,040
no no no no you know just do these
 

9031
03:00:57,040 --> 03:00:58,910
no no no no you know just do these
things and then you might arrange it in

9032
03:00:58,910 --> 03:00:58,920
things and then you might arrange it in
 

9033
03:00:58,920 --> 03:01:01,349
things and then you might arrange it in
weird ways so that there might be three

9034
03:01:01,349 --> 03:01:01,359
weird ways so that there might be three
 

9035
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:05,150
weird ways so that there might be three
measures of verse and then one you know

9036
03:01:05,150 --> 03:01:05,160
measures of verse and then one you know
 

9037
03:01:05,160 --> 03:01:07,309
measures of verse and then one you know
and then five measures of chorus and

9038
03:01:07,309 --> 03:01:07,319
and then five measures of chorus and
 

9039
03:01:07,319 --> 03:01:08,870
and then five measures of chorus and
then two measure so you could just mess

9040
03:01:08,870 --> 03:01:08,880
then two measure so you could just mess
 

9041
03:01:08,880 --> 03:01:10,269
then two measure so you could just mess
around with everything right what does

9042
03:01:10,269 --> 03:01:10,279
around with everything right what does
 

9043
03:01:10,279 --> 03:01:13,030
around with everything right what does
that feel like to listen to there's

03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:13,040
that feel like to listen to there's
 

9045
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:15,150
that feel like to listen to there's
there's something about symmetry or or

9046
03:01:15,150 --> 03:01:15,160
there's something about symmetry or or
 

9047
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:18,030
there's something about symmetry or or
like patterns that feel

9048
03:01:18,030 --> 03:01:18,040
like patterns that feel
 

9049
03:01:18,040 --> 03:01:20,070
like patterns that feel
good and like relaxing for us or

9050

whatever feels like home and disturbing
 

9053
03:01:22,439 --> 03:01:25,030

9057
03:01:27,319 --> 03:01:30,630
that is that the feeling you would have
if you were keeping math Rock I mean

9058
03:01:30,630 --> 03:01:30,640
if you were keeping math Rock I mean
 

9059
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:31,790
if you were keeping math Rock I mean
yeah yeah that's stressing me out just

9060
03:01:31,790 --> 03:01:31,800
yeah yeah that's stressing me out just

style of songwriting is very much like

9066
03:01:40,710 --> 03:01:40,720
style of songwriting is very much like
 

9067
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:43,870
style of songwriting is very much like
in terms of like repetitive themes but

9068
03:01:43,870 --> 03:01:43,880
in terms of like repetitive themes but
 

9069
03:01:43,880 --> 03:01:46,510
in terms of like repetitive themes but
messing around with structure cuz I'm

9070
03:01:46,510 --> 03:01:46,520
messing around with structure cuz I'm
 

9071
03:01:46,520 --> 03:01:49,190
messing around with structure cuz I'm
not a great guitarist technically and so

9072
03:01:49,190 --> 03:01:49,200
not a great guitarist technically and so
 

9073
03:01:49,200 --> 03:01:50,910
not a great guitarist technically and so
I don't play complicated stuff and

9074
03:01:50,910 --> 03:01:50,920
I don't play complicated stuff and
 

9075
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:52,429
I don't play complicated stuff and
there's things you can hear stuff where

9076
03:01:52,429 --> 03:01:52,439
there's things you can hear stuff where
 

9077
03:01:52,439 --> 03:01:55,309
there's things you can hear stuff where
it's just like so complicated you know

9078
03:01:55,309 --> 03:01:55,319
it's just like so complicated you know
 

9079
03:01:55,319 --> 03:01:57,550
it's just like so complicated you know
um but often what I find is is like

9080
03:01:57,550 --> 03:01:57,560
um but often what I find is is like
 

9081
03:01:57,560 --> 03:02:01,110
um but often what I find is is like
having a melody or and then adding some

9082
03:02:01,110 --> 03:02:01,120
having a melody or and then adding some
 

9083
03:02:01,120 --> 03:02:03,870
having a melody or and then adding some
dissonance to it just enough and then

9084
03:02:03,870 --> 03:02:03,880
dissonance to it just enough and then
 

9085
03:02:03,880 --> 03:02:06,590
dissonance to it just enough and then
adding some complexity that gets gets

9086
03:02:06,590 --> 03:02:06,600
adding some complexity that gets gets
 

9087
03:02:06,600 --> 03:02:08,870
adding some complexity that gets gets
you going just enough but I have a high

9088
03:02:08,870 --> 03:02:08,880
you going just enough but I have a high
 

9089
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:11,030
you going just enough but I have a high
tolerance for for that kind of

9090
03:02:11,030 --> 03:02:11,040
tolerance for for that kind of
 

9091
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:13,110
tolerance for for that kind of
dissonance and prediction I think I have

9092
03:02:13,110 --> 03:02:13,120
dissonance and prediction I think I have
 

9093
03:02:13,120 --> 03:02:14,910
dissonance and prediction I think I have
a theory a pet theory that it's like

9094
03:02:14,910 --> 03:02:14,920
a theory a pet theory that it's like
 

9095
03:02:14,920 --> 03:02:16,710
a theory a pet theory that it's like
basically you can explain most of human

9096
03:02:16,710 --> 03:02:16,720
basically you can explain most of human
 

9097
03:02:16,720 --> 03:02:19,030
basically you can explain most of human
behavior as some people are lumpers and

9098
03:02:19,030 --> 03:02:19,040
behavior as some people are lumpers and
 

9099
03:02:19,040 --> 03:02:21,389
behavior as some people are lumpers and
some people are Splitters you know and

9100
03:02:21,389 --> 03:02:21,399
some people are Splitters you know and
 

9101
03:02:21,399 --> 03:02:23,389
some people are Splitters you know and
so it's like some people are very kind

9102
03:02:23,389 --> 03:02:23,399
so it's like some people are very kind
 

9103
03:02:23,399 --> 03:02:26,070
so it's like some people are very kind
of excited when they get this distance

9104
03:02:26,070 --> 03:02:26,080
of excited when they get this distance
 

9105
03:02:26,080 --> 03:02:27,830
of excited when they get this distance
and they want to like go with it so

9106
03:02:27,830 --> 03:02:27,840
and they want to like go with it so
 

9107
03:02:27,840 --> 03:02:29,389
and they want to like go with it so
people are just like no I want to lump

basically created learning theory so you
know there's that but also it's like but

like uh fall on the floor and generate
 

9207
03:04:32,920 --> 03:04:35,469
like uh fall on the floor and generate
feedback I've like I think in the last

9208
03:04:35,469 --> 03:04:35,479
feedback I've like I think in the last
 

9209
03:04:35,479 --> 03:04:36,670
feedback I've like I think in the last
version it might have been that or a

9210
03:04:36,670 --> 03:04:36,680
version it might have been that or a

aluminum that I got made and I thought
this thing's indestructible and so I

9218

this thing's indestructible and so I
 

9219
03:04:45,239 --> 03:04:47,790
this thing's indestructible and so I
kind of like was just you know moving

around had it upside down and all this
 

9223
03:04:49,680 --> 03:04:51,510
around had it upside down and all this
stuff to generate feedback and I think I

9224
03:04:51,510 --> 03:04:51,520
stuff to generate feedback and I think I
 

9225
03:04:51,520 --> 03:04:52,790
stuff to generate feedback and I think I
broke one of the I broke one of the

9226
03:04:52,790 --> 03:04:52,800
broke one of the I broke one of the

9235
03:05:03,479 --> 03:05:06,510
question but let me ask you we've been
talking about Neuroscience in general uh

9236
03:05:06,510 --> 03:05:06,520
talking about Neuroscience in general uh
 

9237
03:05:06,520 --> 03:05:09,190
talking about Neuroscience in general uh
what what do you you've been studying

9238

you love most about the human mind like
 

9243
03:05:15,279 --> 03:05:17,750
you love most about the human mind like
when you look at it uh we look at the

9244

when you look at it uh we look at the
 

9245
03:05:17,760 --> 03:05:20,790
when you look at it uh we look at the
fmri just the scans and the behavioral

03:05:20,790 --> 03:05:20,800
fmri just the scans and the behavioral
 

9247
03:05:20,800 --> 03:05:23,349
fmri just the scans and the behavioral
stuff the electros you know the

9248
03:05:23,349 --> 03:05:23,359
stuff the electros you know the
 

9249
03:05:23,359 --> 03:05:25,510

03:05:27,590 --> 03:05:27,600
on the biology side neur biology all of
 

9253
03:05:27,600 --> 03:05:30,070
on the biology side neur biology all of
it when you look at it what

what what is most like beautiful to you

9256
03:05:33,710 --> 03:05:33,720
what what is most like beautiful to you
 

9257
03:05:33,720 --> 03:05:36,630
what what is most like beautiful to you
I think the most beautiful but

9258

incredibly hard to put your finger on is

9260
03:05:40,150 --> 03:05:40,160
incredibly hard to put your finger on is
 

9261
03:05:40,160 --> 03:05:43,229
incredibly hard to put your finger on is
this idea of the internal model that

9262
03:05:43,229 --> 03:05:43,239
this idea of the internal model that
 

9263
03:05:43,239 --> 03:05:45,510
this idea of the internal model that
it's like there's everything you see and

9264
03:05:45,510 --> 03:05:45,520
it's like there's everything you see and
 

9265
03:05:45,520 --> 03:05:47,190
it's like there's everything you see and
there's everything you hear and touch

9266
03:05:47,190 --> 03:05:47,200
there's everything you hear and touch
 

9267
03:05:47,200 --> 03:05:48,830
there's everything you hear and touch
and take tast you know Every Breath You

9268
03:05:48,830 --> 03:05:48,840
and take tast you know Every Breath You
 

9269
03:05:48,840 --> 03:05:49,710
and take tast you know Every Breath You
Take

9270

Take
 

9271
03:05:49,720 --> 03:05:53,950
Take
whatever but it's all connected by this

9272
03:05:53,950 --> 03:05:53,960
whatever but it's all connected by this
 

9273
03:05:53,960 --> 03:05:58,030
whatever but it's all connected by this
like dark energy that's holding that

9274
03:05:58,030 --> 03:05:58,040
like dark energy that's holding that
 

9275
03:05:58,040 --> 03:06:00,229
like dark energy that's holding that
whole universe of your mind together

9276
03:06:00,229 --> 03:06:00,239
whole universe of your mind together
 

9277
03:06:00,239 --> 03:06:02,510
whole universe of your mind together
right and without that it's just a bunch

9278
03:06:02,510 --> 03:06:02,520
right and without that it's just a bunch
 

9279
03:06:02,520 --> 03:06:05,870
right and without that it's just a bunch
of stuff and somehow we put that

9280
03:06:05,870 --> 03:06:05,880
of stuff and somehow we put that
 

9281
03:06:05,880 --> 03:06:10,870
of stuff and somehow we put that
together and it forms our so much of our

9282
03:06:10,870 --> 03:06:10,880
together and it forms our so much of our
 

9283
03:06:10,880 --> 03:06:13,349
together and it forms our so much of our
experience and being able to figure out

9284
03:06:13,349 --> 03:06:13,359
experience and being able to figure out
 

9285
03:06:13,359 --> 03:06:15,910
experience and being able to figure out
where that comes from and how things are

9286
03:06:15,910 --> 03:06:15,920
where that comes from and how things are
 

9287
03:06:15,920 --> 03:06:19,670
where that comes from and how things are
connected to me is is just amazing but

9288
03:06:19,670 --> 03:06:19,680
connected to me is is just amazing but
 

9289
03:06:19,680 --> 03:06:22,110
connected to me is is just amazing but
just this idea of like that the world in

9290
03:06:22,110 --> 03:06:22,120
just this idea of like that the world in
 

9291
03:06:22,120 --> 03:06:23,710
just this idea of like that the world in
front of us we're only sampling this

9292
03:06:23,710 --> 03:06:23,720
front of us we're only sampling this
 

9293
03:06:23,720 --> 03:06:25,630
front of us we're only sampling this
little bit and trying to take so much

9294
03:06:25,630 --> 03:06:25,640
little bit and trying to take so much
 

9295
03:06:25,640 --> 03:06:28,229
little bit and trying to take so much
meaning from it and we do a really good

9296
03:06:28,229 --> 03:06:28,239
meaning from it and we do a really good
 

9297
03:06:28,239 --> 03:06:31,190
meaning from it and we do a really good
job not perfect I mean you know but that

9298
03:06:31,190 --> 03:06:31,200
job not perfect I mean you know but that
 

9299
03:06:31,200 --> 03:06:34,309
job not perfect I mean you know but that
ability to me is just amazing yeah it's

9300
03:06:34,309 --> 03:06:34,319
ability to me is just amazing yeah it's
 

9301
03:06:34,319 --> 03:06:36,110
ability to me is just amazing yeah it's
an incredible mystery all of it it's

9302
03:06:36,110 --> 03:06:36,120
an incredible mystery all of it it's
 

9303
03:06:36,120 --> 03:06:37,710
an incredible mystery all of it it's
funny you said Dark Energy because the

9304
03:06:37,710 --> 03:06:37,720
funny you said Dark Energy because the
 

9305
03:06:37,720 --> 03:06:40,150
funny you said Dark Energy because the
same in in astrophysics you look out

9306
03:06:40,150 --> 03:06:40,160
same in in astrophysics you look out
 

9307
03:06:40,160 --> 03:06:42,110
same in in astrophysics you look out
there you look at dark matter and dark

9308
03:06:42,110 --> 03:06:42,120
there you look at dark matter and dark
 

9309
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:45,710
there you look at dark matter and dark
energy which is this loose term assigned

9310
03:06:45,710 --> 03:06:45,720
energy which is this loose term assigned
 

9311
03:06:45,720 --> 03:06:47,110
energy which is this loose term assigned
to a thing we don't understand which

9312
03:06:47,110 --> 03:06:47,120
to a thing we don't understand which
 

9313
03:06:47,120 --> 03:06:49,670
to a thing we don't understand which
makes up which helps make the equations

9314
03:06:49,670 --> 03:06:49,680
makes up which helps make the equations
 

9315
03:06:49,680 --> 03:06:51,910
makes up which helps make the equations
work in terms of gravity and the

9316
03:06:51,910 --> 03:06:51,920
work in terms of gravity and the
 

9317
03:06:51,920 --> 03:06:53,630
work in terms of gravity and the
expansion of the universe in the same

9318
03:06:53,630 --> 03:06:53,640
expansion of the universe in the same
 

9319
03:06:53,640 --> 03:06:55,710
expansion of the universe in the same
way it seems like there's that kind of

9320
03:06:55,710 --> 03:06:55,720
way it seems like there's that kind of
 

9321
03:06:55,720 --> 03:06:57,750
way it seems like there's that kind of
thing in the human mind that we're like

9322
03:06:57,750 --> 03:06:57,760
thing in the human mind that we're like
 

9323
03:06:57,760 --> 03:07:00,229
thing in the human mind that we're like
striving to understand yeah yeah you

9324
03:07:00,229 --> 03:07:00,239
striving to understand yeah yeah you
 

9325
03:07:00,239 --> 03:07:01,469
striving to understand yeah yeah you
know it's funny that you mentioned that

9326
03:07:01,469 --> 03:07:01,479
know it's funny that you mentioned that
 

9327
03:07:01,479 --> 03:07:03,150
know it's funny that you mentioned that
so one of the reasons I wrote the book

9328
03:07:03,150 --> 03:07:03,160
so one of the reasons I wrote the book
 

9329
03:07:03,160 --> 03:07:05,349
so one of the reasons I wrote the book
amongst many is is that I really felt

9330
03:07:05,349 --> 03:07:05,359
amongst many is is that I really felt
 

9331
03:07:05,359 --> 03:07:07,070
amongst many is is that I really felt
like people needed to hear from

9332
03:07:07,070 --> 03:07:07,080
like people needed to hear from
 

9333
03:07:07,080 --> 03:07:09,710
like people needed to hear from
scientists and like Co was just a great

9334
03:07:09,710 --> 03:07:09,720
scientists and like Co was just a great
 

9335
03:07:09,720 --> 03:07:12,030
scientists and like Co was just a great
example of this because like people

9336
03:07:12,030 --> 03:07:12,040
example of this because like people
 

9337
03:07:12,040 --> 03:07:13,990
example of this because like people
weren't hearing from scientists one of

9338
03:07:13,990 --> 03:07:14,000
weren't hearing from scientists one of
 

9339
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:15,469
weren't hearing from scientists one of
the things I think that people didn't

9340
03:07:15,469 --> 03:07:15,479
the things I think that people didn't
 

9341
03:07:15,479 --> 03:07:18,670
the things I think that people didn't
get was the uncertainty of science and

9342
03:07:18,670 --> 03:07:18,680
get was the uncertainty of science and
 

9343
03:07:18,680 --> 03:07:21,550
get was the uncertainty of science and
how much we don't know and I think every

9344
03:07:21,550 --> 03:07:21,560
how much we don't know and I think every
 

9345
03:07:21,560 --> 03:07:23,750
how much we don't know and I think every
scientist lives in this world of

9346
03:07:23,750 --> 03:07:23,760
scientist lives in this world of
 

9347
03:07:23,760 --> 03:07:28,389
scientist lives in this world of
uncertainty and when I was uh um writing

9348
03:07:28,389 --> 03:07:28,399
uncertainty and when I was uh um writing
 

9349
03:07:28,399 --> 03:07:30,590
uncertainty and when I was uh um writing
the book I just became aware of all of

9350
03:07:30,590 --> 03:07:30,600
the book I just became aware of all of
 

9351
03:07:30,600 --> 03:07:32,269
the book I just became aware of all of
these things we don't know and so I

9352
03:07:32,269 --> 03:07:32,279
these things we don't know and so I
 

9353
03:07:32,279 --> 03:07:34,590
these things we don't know and so I
think of physics a lot I think of this

9354
03:07:34,590 --> 03:07:34,600
think of physics a lot I think of this
 

9355
03:07:34,600 --> 03:07:36,030
think of physics a lot I think of this
idea of

9356
03:07:36,030 --> 03:07:36,040
idea of
 

9357
03:07:36,040 --> 03:07:39,469
idea of
like overwhelming majority of the stuff

9358
03:07:39,469 --> 03:07:39,479
like overwhelming majority of the stuff
 

9359
03:07:39,479 --> 03:07:41,229
like overwhelming majority of the stuff
that's in our universe cannot be

9360
03:07:41,229 --> 03:07:41,239
that's in our universe cannot be
 

9361
03:07:41,239 --> 03:07:43,870
that's in our universe cannot be
directly measured I used to think haha I

9362
03:07:43,870 --> 03:07:43,880
directly measured I used to think haha I
 

9363
03:07:43,880 --> 03:07:46,349
directly measured I used to think haha I
hate physics so this is physicists get

9364
03:07:46,349 --> 03:07:46,359
hate physics so this is physicists get
 

9365
03:07:46,359 --> 03:07:48,229
hate physics so this is physicists get
The Nobel prize for doing whatever

9366
03:07:48,229 --> 03:07:48,239
The Nobel prize for doing whatever
 

9367
03:07:48,239 --> 03:07:49,750
The Nobel prize for doing whatever
stupid thing it's like there's 10

9368
03:07:49,750 --> 03:07:49,760
stupid thing it's like there's 10
 

9369
03:07:49,760 --> 03:07:52,110
stupid thing it's like there's 10
physicists out there I'm just kidding

9370
03:07:52,110 --> 03:07:52,120
physicists out there I'm just kidding
 

9371
03:07:52,120 --> 03:07:54,670
physicists out there I'm just kidding
dis strong words yeah no no no I'm

9372
03:07:54,670 --> 03:07:54,680
dis strong words yeah no no no I'm
 

9373
03:07:54,680 --> 03:07:56,229
dis strong words yeah no no no I'm
kidding it's the physicists who do

9374
03:07:56,229 --> 03:07:56,239
kidding it's the physicists who do
 

9375
03:07:56,239 --> 03:07:58,309
kidding it's the physicists who do
Neuroscience can be rather opinionated

9376
03:07:58,309 --> 03:07:58,319
Neuroscience can be rather opinionated
 

9377
03:07:58,319 --> 03:08:00,110
Neuroscience can be rather opinionated
so sometimes I like to Dish on it's all

9378
03:08:00,110 --> 03:08:00,120
so sometimes I like to Dish on it's all
 

9379
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:03,190
so sometimes I like to Dish on it's all
love it's all love that's right I it's

9380
03:08:03,190 --> 03:08:03,200
love it's all love that's right I it's
 

9381
03:08:03,200 --> 03:08:08,150
love it's all love that's right I it's
8hd talking so um uh but at some point I

9382
03:08:08,150 --> 03:08:08,160
8hd talking so um uh but at some point I
 

9383
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:10,990
8hd talking so um uh but at some point I
had this aha moment where I was like to

9384
03:08:10,990 --> 03:08:11,000
had this aha moment where I was like to
 

9385
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:16,349
had this aha moment where I was like to
be aware of that much that we don't know

9386
03:08:16,349 --> 03:08:16,359
be aware of that much that we don't know
 

9387
03:08:16,359 --> 03:08:18,429
be aware of that much that we don't know
and have a beat on it and be able to go

9388
03:08:18,429 --> 03:08:18,439
and have a beat on it and be able to go
 

9389
03:08:18,439 --> 03:08:20,950
and have a beat on it and be able to go
towards it that's one of the biggest

9390
03:08:20,950 --> 03:08:20,960
towards it that's one of the biggest
 

9391
03:08:20,960 --> 03:08:23,150
towards it that's one of the biggest
scientific successes that I could think

9392
03:08:23,150 --> 03:08:23,160
scientific successes that I could think
 

9393
03:08:23,160 --> 03:08:26,110
scientific successes that I could think
of you are aware that you don't know

9394
03:08:26,110 --> 03:08:26,120
of you are aware that you don't know
 

9395
03:08:26,120 --> 03:08:29,190
of you are aware that you don't know
about this gigantic section overwhelming

9396
03:08:29,190 --> 03:08:29,200
about this gigantic section overwhelming
 

9397
03:08:29,200 --> 03:08:31,510
about this gigantic section overwhelming
majority of the universe right and I

9398
03:08:31,510 --> 03:08:31,520
majority of the universe right and I
 

9399
03:08:31,520 --> 03:08:35,710
majority of the universe right and I
think the more what keeps me going to

9400
03:08:35,710 --> 03:08:35,720
think the more what keeps me going to
 

9401
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:39,510
think the more what keeps me going to
some extent is realizing the changing

9402
03:08:39,510 --> 03:08:39,520
some extent is realizing the changing
 

9403
03:08:39,520 --> 03:08:41,710
some extent is realizing the changing
the scope of the problem and figuring

9404
03:08:41,710 --> 03:08:41,720
the scope of the problem and figuring
 

9405
03:08:41,720 --> 03:08:43,269
the scope of the problem and figuring
out oh my God there's all these things

9406
03:08:43,269 --> 03:08:43,279
out oh my God there's all these things
 

9407
03:08:43,279 --> 03:08:46,429
out oh my God there's all these things
we don't know and I thought I knew this

9408
03:08:46,429 --> 03:08:46,439
we don't know and I thought I knew this
 

9409
03:08:46,439 --> 03:08:49,110
we don't know and I thought I knew this
because science is all about assumptions

9410
03:08:49,110 --> 03:08:49,120
because science is all about assumptions
 

9411
03:08:49,120 --> 03:08:49,990
because science is all about assumptions
right so have you ever read the

9412
03:08:49,990 --> 03:08:50,000
right so have you ever read the
 

9413
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:51,910
right so have you ever read the
structure of scientific revolutions by

9414
03:08:51,910 --> 03:08:51,920
structure of scientific revolutions by

Thomas yes that's like my only

9416
03:08:55,190 --> 03:08:55,200
Thomas yes that's like my only
 

9417
03:08:55,200 --> 03:08:57,429
Thomas yes that's like my only
philosophy really that I've read but

9418
03:08:57,429 --> 03:08:57,439
philosophy really that I've read but
 

9419
03:08:57,439 --> 03:09:00,030
philosophy really that I've read but
it's so brilliant in the way that they

9420
03:09:00,030 --> 03:09:00,040
it's so brilliant in the way that they
 

9421
03:09:00,040 --> 03:09:02,030
it's so brilliant in the way that they
frame this idea of like he frames this

9422
03:09:02,030 --> 03:09:02,040
frame this idea of like he frames this
 

9423
03:09:02,040 --> 03:09:05,030
frame this idea of like he frames this
idea of assumptions being core to the

9424
03:09:05,030 --> 03:09:05,040
idea of assumptions being core to the
 

9425
03:09:05,040 --> 03:09:06,990
idea of assumptions being core to the
scientific process and the Paradigm

9426
03:09:06,990 --> 03:09:07,000
scientific process and the Paradigm
 

9427

Shift comes from changing those

9428
03:09:09,150 --> 03:09:09,160
Shift comes from changing those
 

9429
03:09:09,160 --> 03:09:11,590
Shift comes from changing those
assumptions and this idea of like

9430
03:09:11,590 --> 03:09:11,600
assumptions and this idea of like
 

9431
03:09:11,600 --> 03:09:14,630
assumptions and this idea of like
finding out this kind of whole zone of

9432
03:09:14,630 --> 03:09:14,640
finding out this kind of whole zone of
 

9433
03:09:14,640 --> 03:09:16,190
finding out this kind of whole zone of
what you don't know to me is the

9434
03:09:16,190 --> 03:09:16,200
what you don't know to me is the
 

9435
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:18,389
what you don't know to me is the
exciting part you know

9436
03:09:18,389 --> 03:09:18,399
exciting part you know
 

9437
03:09:18,399 --> 03:09:21,870
exciting part you know
well you are a great scientist and you

today you've uh decreased the amount of

9444
03:09:30,670 --> 03:09:30,680
today you've uh decreased the amount of
 

9445
03:09:30,680 --> 03:09:34,269
today you've uh decreased the amount of
uncertainty I have uh just a tiny little

9446
03:09:34,269 --> 03:09:34,279
uncertainty I have uh just a tiny little
 

9447
03:09:34,279 --> 03:09:36,630
uncertainty I have uh just a tiny little
bit today and reveal the beauty of
