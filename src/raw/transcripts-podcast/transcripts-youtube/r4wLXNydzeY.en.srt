mammer can you explain your view on

62
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
mammer can you explain your view on
 

63
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,230
mammer can you explain your view on
power in international Politics as

64
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:33,240
power in international Politics as
 

65
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,630
power in international Politics as
outlined in your book The Tragedy of

66
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:35,640
outlined in your book The Tragedy of
 

67
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,109
outlined in your book The Tragedy of
great power politics and in your writing

68
00:01:38,109 --> 00:01:38,119
great power politics and in your writing
 

69
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,190
great power politics and in your writing
since then yeah I make two sets of

70
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,200
since then yeah I make two sets of
 

71
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,350
since then yeah I make two sets of
points there first of all I believe that

72
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
points there first of all I believe that
 

73
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,389
points there first of all I believe that
power is the currency of international

74
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:45,399
power is the currency of international
 

75
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:47,950
power is the currency of international
relations and by that I mean that states

76
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:47,960
relations and by that I mean that states
 

77
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,990
relations and by that I mean that states
are deeply interested in the balance of

78
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,000
are deeply interested in the balance of
 

79
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,950
are deeply interested in the balance of
power and they're interested in

80
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:51,960
power and they're interested in
 

81
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,469
power and they're interested in
maximizing how much power they control

82
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:55,479
maximizing how much power they control
 

83
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,429
maximizing how much power they control
and the question is why States care so

84
00:01:58,429 --> 00:01:58,439
and the question is why States care so
 

85
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,709
and the question is why States care so
much about power I in the International

86
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:01,719
much about power I in the International
 

87
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,149
much about power I in the International
System there's no higher authority so if

88
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:05,159
System there's no higher authority so if
 

89
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,790
System there's no higher authority so if
you get into trouble and you dial 911

90
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:08,800
you get into trouble and you dial 911
 

91
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,949
you get into trouble and you dial 911
there's nobody at the other end in a

92
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:11,959
there's nobody at the other end in a
 

93
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,150
there's nobody at the other end in a
system like that you have no choice but

94
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
system like that you have no choice but
 

95
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,030
system like that you have no choice but
to figure out for yourself how best to

96
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
to figure out for yourself how best to
 

97
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,830
to figure out for yourself how best to
protect yourself and the best way to

98
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
protect yourself and the best way to
 

99
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,309
protect yourself and the best way to
protect yourself is to be powerful to

100
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
protect yourself is to be powerful to
 

101
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,670
protect yourself is to be powerful to
have as much power as you can possibly

102
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:26,680
have as much power as you can possibly
 

103
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,910
have as much power as you can possibly
gain over all the other states in the

104
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
gain over all the other states in the
 

105
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,990
gain over all the other states in the
system therefore States care about power

106
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
system therefore States care about power
 

107
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,190
system therefore States care about power
because it enhances or maximizes their

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
because it enhances or maximizes their

because it enhances or maximizes their
prospects for survival second point I

00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:39,959
prospects for survival second point I
 

111
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,670
prospects for survival second point I
would make is that in the real story or

112
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:42,680
would make is that in the real story or
 

113
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,790
would make is that in the real story or
in my story power is largely a function

114
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
in my story power is largely a function
 

115
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,949
in my story power is largely a function
of material factors uh the two ke key

116
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
of material factors uh the two ke key
 

117
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,149
of material factors uh the two ke key
building blocks of Power are population

118
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:54,159
building blocks of Power are population
 

119
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,949
building blocks of Power are population
size and wealth you want to have a lot

120
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
size and wealth you want to have a lot
 

121
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,710
size and wealth you want to have a lot
of people and you want to be really

of people and you want to be really
 

123
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,430
of people and you want to be really
wealthy of course of course this is why

124
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:00,440
wealthy of course of course this is why
 

125
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,149
wealthy of course of course this is why
the United States is so powerful it has

126
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
the United States is so powerful it has
 

127
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,309
the United States is so powerful it has
lots of people and it has lots of wealth

128
00:03:07,309 --> 00:03:07,319
lots of people and it has lots of wealth
 

129
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:10,149
lots of people and it has lots of wealth
China was not considered a great power

130
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
China was not considered a great power
 

131
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,110
China was not considered a great power
until

132
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,120
until
 

133
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,390
until
recently uh because it didn't have a lot

134
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:13,400
recently uh because it didn't have a lot
 

135
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,350
recently uh because it didn't have a lot
of wealth certainly had population size

136
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:16,360
of wealth certainly had population size
 

137
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,789
of wealth certainly had population size
but it didn't have wealth and without

138
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:18,799
but it didn't have wealth and without
 

139
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,750
but it didn't have wealth and without
both a large population and much wealth

140
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
both a large population and much wealth
 

141
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,190
both a large population and much wealth
you're usually not considered a great

142
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,200
you're usually not considered a great
 

143
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,550
you're usually not considered a great
power uh so I think power matters uh but

144
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:29,560
power uh so I think power matters uh but
 

145
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,589
power uh so I think power matters uh but
uh when we talk about power it's

146
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
uh when we talk about power it's
 

147
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,030
uh when we talk about power it's
important to understand that it's a

148
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,040
important to understand that it's a
 

149
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,350
important to understand that it's a
population size and wealth that are

150
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,360
population size and wealth that are
 

151
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,630
population size and wealth that are
underpinning it so there's a lot of

152
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
underpinning it so there's a lot of
 

153
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,390
underpinning it so there's a lot of
interesting things there first you said

154
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:43,400
interesting things there first you said
 

155
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,910
interesting things there first you said
nations in relation to each other are is

156
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:46,920
nations in relation to each other are is
 

157
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,470
nations in relation to each other are is
essentially in a state of anarchism yeah

158
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:49,480
essentially in a state of anarchism yeah
 

159
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,670
essentially in a state of anarchism yeah
well Anarchy basically means the

160
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:52,680
well Anarchy basically means the
 

161
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,990
well Anarchy basically means the
opposite of hierarchy sometimes people

162
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,000
opposite of hierarchy sometimes people
 

163
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,630
opposite of hierarchy sometimes people
think when you're talking about Anarchy

164
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
think when you're talking about Anarchy
 

165
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,509
think when you're talking about Anarchy
you're talking about murder and mayham

166
00:03:58,509 --> 00:03:58,519
you're talking about murder and mayham
 

167
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:00,670
you're talking about murder and mayham
but that's not what Anarchy means in the

168
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:00,680
but that's not what Anarchy means in the
 

169
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,069
but that's not what Anarchy means in the
realist context Anarchy simply means

170
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:04,079
realist context Anarchy simply means
 

171
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:06,149
realist context Anarchy simply means
that you don't have hierarchy there's no

172
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
that you don't have hierarchy there's no
 

173
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,069
that you don't have hierarchy there's no
higher authority that sits above States

174
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:09,079
higher authority that sits above States
 

175
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,509
higher authority that sits above States
states are like pool balls on a table

176
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:12,519
states are like pool balls on a table
 

177
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,629
states are like pool balls on a table
right and in an anarchic world uh

178
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
right and in an anarchic world uh
 

179
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,390
right and in an anarchic world uh
there's no higher authority that you can

180
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:19,400
there's no higher authority that you can
 

181
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,469
there's no higher authority that you can
turn to uh if you get into trouble and

182
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
turn to uh if you get into trouble and
 

183
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,870
turn to uh if you get into trouble and
of course the political philosopher who

184
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:25,880
of course the political philosopher who
 

185
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,150
of course the political philosopher who
laid this all out was Thomas Hobbs and

186
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,160
laid this all out was Thomas Hobbs and
 

187
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,469
laid this all out was Thomas Hobbs and
Hobbs talked about life in the state of

188
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:31,479
Hobbs talked about life in the state of
 

189
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,230
Hobbs talked about life in the state of
nature and in the state of nature you

190
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
nature and in the state of nature you
 

191
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,230
nature and in the state of nature you
have

192
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:35,240
have
 

193
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,590
have
individuals and those individuals

194
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
individuals and those individuals
 

195
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,710
individuals and those individuals
compete with each other for power and

196
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:39,720
compete with each other for power and
 

197
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,430
compete with each other for power and
the reason that they do is because in

198
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
the reason that they do is because in
 

199
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,870
the reason that they do is because in
the state of nature by definition you

200
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:43,880
the state of nature by definition you
 

201
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,990
the state of nature by definition you
have no higher authority and hobbs' view

202
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,000
have no higher authority and hobbs' view
 

203
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,550
have no higher authority and hobbs' view
is that the way to get out of this

204
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:49,560
is that the way to get out of this
 

205
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,670
is that the way to get out of this
terrible situation where individuals are

206
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:52,680
terrible situation where individuals are
 

207
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,510
terrible situation where individuals are
competing with each other and even

208
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:54,520
competing with each other and even
 

209
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,189
competing with each other and even
killing each other is to create a state

210
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
killing each other is to create a state

it's what he calls the Leviathan and

212
00:04:59,629 --> 00:04:59,639
it's what he calls the Leviathan and
 

213
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,510
it's what he calls the Leviathan and
that of course is the title of his

214
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
that of course is the title of his
 

215
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,230
that of course is the title of his
famous book so the idea is to escape

216
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
famous book so the idea is to escape
 

217
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,790

Anarchy you create a state and that

218
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:09,800
Anarchy you create a state and that
 

219
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,430
Anarchy you create a state and that
means you go from Anarchy to hierarchy

220
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
means you go from Anarchy to hierarchy
 

221
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,029
means you go from Anarchy to hierarchy
the problem in international politics is

222
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:16,039
the problem in international politics is
 

223
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,909
the problem in international politics is
that there is no world State there is no

224
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:18,919
that there is no world State there is no
 

225
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,150
that there is no world State there is no
hierarchy and if you have no hierarchy

226
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
hierarchy and if you have no hierarchy
 

227
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,390
hierarchy and if you have no hierarchy
and you're in an anarchic system you

228
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,400
and you're in an anarchic system you
 

229
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,710
and you're in an anarchic system you
have no choice but to try to maximize

230
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
have no choice but to try to maximize
 

231
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,990
have no choice but to try to maximize
your relative power to make sure you are

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
your relative power to make sure you are

your relative power to make sure you are
as we used to say when I was a kid on

234
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
as we used to say when I was a kid on
 

235

New York City playgrounds the biggest

New York City playgrounds the biggest
 

237
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,909
New York City playgrounds the biggest
and baddest dude on the Block not

00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:38,919
and baddest dude on the Block not
 

239
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,710
and baddest dude on the Block not
because you necessarily want to beat up

240
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
because you necessarily want to beat up
 

241
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,870
because you necessarily want to beat up
on other kids or on other states but

242
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:43,880
on other kids or on other states but
 

243
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,749
on other kids or on other states but
because again that's the best way to

244
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:46,759
because again that's the best way to
 

245
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,150
because again that's the best way to
survive and as I like to point out to

246
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,160
survive and as I like to point out to
 

247
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,950
survive and as I like to point out to
people the best example of what happens

248
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:51,960
people the best example of what happens
 

249
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,309
people the best example of what happens
when you're weak in international

00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:54,319
when you're weak in international
 

251
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,629
when you're weak in international
politics is what the Chinese call the

252
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
politics is what the Chinese call the
 

253
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,430
politics is what the Chinese call the
century of national humiliation uh from

254
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
century of national humiliation uh from
 

255
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,749
century of national humiliation uh from
from the late 1840s to the late 1940s

256
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:02,759
from the late 1840s to the late 1940s
 

257
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,790
from the late 1840s to the late 1940s
the Chinese were remarkably weak and the

258
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:05,800
the Chinese were remarkably weak and the
 

259
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,870
the Chinese were remarkably weak and the
great powers in the system prayed upon

260
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:07,880
great powers in the system prayed upon
 

261
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,230
great powers in the system prayed upon
them and uh that sends a very important

262
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,240
them and uh that sends a very important
 

263
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,629
them and uh that sends a very important
message to not only the Chinese but to

264
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:13,639
message to not only the Chinese but to
 

265
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,189
message to not only the Chinese but to
other states in the system don't be weak

266
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:16,199
other states in the system don't be weak
 

267
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,510
other states in the system don't be weak
be as powerful as you can and we'll talk

268
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:18,520
be as powerful as you can and we'll talk
 

269
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,350
be as powerful as you can and we'll talk
about it but humiliation can lead to

270
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:20,360
about it but humiliation can lead to
 

271
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,950
about it but humiliation can lead to
resentment and resentment leads to uh

resentment and resentment leads to uh

resentment and resentment leads to uh
something you've also studied which is

something you've also studied which is

Nazi Germany in the
 

277
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,189
Nazi Germany in the
1930s we'll talk about it um

1930s we'll talk about it um
 

279
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,270
1930s we'll talk about it um
but staying to the psychology and

but staying to the psychology and
 

281
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,189

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
picture what's the connection between

the will to power in the individual as
you mentioned and the will to power in a

nation the will to power in an
 

291
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,550
nation the will to power in an
individual has a lot to do with

292
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
individual has a lot to do with
 

293
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,350
individual has a lot to do with
individual's psychology uh the story

294
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
individual's psychology uh the story
 

295
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,790
individual's psychology uh the story
that I tell about the pursuit of power

296
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:51,800
that I tell about the pursuit of power
 

297
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,909
that I tell about the pursuit of power
is a structural argument it it's an

298
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:53,919
is a structural argument it it's an
 

299
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,309
is a structural argument it it's an
argument that says when you are in a

300
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
argument that says when you are in a
 

301
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,430
argument that says when you are in a
particular structure when you're in a

302
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
particular structure when you're in a
 

303
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,110
particular structure when you're in a
system that has a specific

304
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
system that has a specific
 

305
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,749
system that has a specific
architecture which is

306
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
architecture which is
 

307
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,110
architecture which is
anarchy the states have no choice but to

308
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
anarchy the states have no choice but to
 

309
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,390
anarchy the states have no choice but to
compete for power uh so structure is

310
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
compete for power uh so structure is
 

311
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,309
compete for power uh so structure is
really driving the story here Will To

really driving the story here Will To

really driving the story here Will To
Power has a lot more to do with an

314
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
Power has a lot more to do with an
 

315
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,510
Power has a lot more to do with an
individual uh in in the nichan story

316
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
individual uh in in the nichan story
 

317
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,029
individual uh in in the nichan story
where that concept comes from so it's

318
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
where that concept comes from so it's
 

319
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,830
where that concept comes from so it's
very important to understand that I'm

320
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
very important to understand that I'm
 

321
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,270
very important to understand that I'm
not arguing that states are inherently

322
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,280
not arguing that states are inherently
 

323
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,390
not arguing that states are inherently
aggressive right my point is that as

324
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:35,400
aggressive right my point is that as
 

325
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,749
aggressive right my point is that as
long as states are in Anarchy right they

326
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
long as states are in Anarchy right they
 

327
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,629
long as states are in Anarchy right they
have no choice but to behave in an

328
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
have no choice but to behave in an
 

329
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,749
have no choice but to behave in an
aggressive fashion but if you went to a

330
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
aggressive fashion but if you went to a
 

331
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,990
aggressive fashion but if you went to a
hierarchic system uh there's no reason

332
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,000
hierarchic system uh there's no reason
 

333
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,510
hierarchic system uh there's no reason
for those states to worry about the

334
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:51,520
for those states to worry about the
 

335
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,589
for those states to worry about the
balance of power because if they get

336
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
balance of power because if they get
 

337
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,950
balance of power because if they get
into trouble there is a higher authority

338
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:55,960
into trouble there is a higher authority
 

339
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,029
into trouble there is a higher authority
that they can turn to there is in effect

340
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:58,039
that they can turn to there is in effect

00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,749
that they can turn to there is in effect
the Leviathan so what is the role of

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:19,720
not no that's right and it's good that
 

357

not no that's right and it's good that
you caught that because if you have a

country what you do is you build a large
 

363
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,510
country what you do is you build a large

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:31,520
military and it's ultimately the size of
 

365
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,709
military and it's ultimately the size of
your military that matters uh because

militaries fight Wars and if states are
 

369
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:40,550
militaries fight Wars and if states are
concerned about survival which I argue

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
concerned about survival which I argue
 

371
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,990
concerned about survival which I argue
is the principal goal of every state in

going to care about having a powerful

another state comes after them what's
 

383
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,430
another state comes after them what's
not obvious that a large Nation with a

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,710
International System States understand
that and they go to Great Lengths to

430
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
that and they go to Great Lengths to
 

431
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,230
that and they go to Great Lengths to
become powerful just take the United

432
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:55,240
become powerful just take the United
 

433
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,110
become powerful just take the United
States of America when it started in

434
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,120
States of America when it started in
 

435
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,389
States of America when it started in
1783 it was comprised of 13 measley

1783 it was comprised of 13 measley
 

437

colonies strung out along the Atlantic
 

439
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,230
colonies strung out along the Atlantic
Seaboard over time you know the uh

440
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
Seaboard over time you know the uh
 

441
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,269
Seaboard over time you know the uh
various leaders of the United States

442
00:10:10,269 --> 00:10:10,279
various leaders of the United States
 

443
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,829
various leaders of the United States
went to Great Lengths to turn that

444
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:12,839
went to Great Lengths to turn that
 

445
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,030
went to Great Lengths to turn that
country into the dominant power in the

446
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,040
country into the dominant power in the
 

447
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,150
country into the dominant power in the
Western Hemisphere and then once that

448
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,160
Western Hemisphere and then once that
 

449
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,910
Western Hemisphere and then once that
was achieved in 1900 we've gone to Great

450
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
was achieved in 1900 we've gone to Great
 

451
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,509
was achieved in 1900 we've gone to Great
Lengths to make sure that there's no

452
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:24,519
Lengths to make sure that there's no
 

453
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,670
Lengths to make sure that there's no
peer uh competitor in the system uh we

454
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:29,680
peer uh competitor in the system uh we
 

455
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,030
peer uh competitor in the system uh we
just want to make sure that we're number

456
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,040
just want to make sure that we're number
 

457
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,710
just want to make sure that we're number
one uh and my argument is that this is

458
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:35,720
one uh and my argument is that this is
 

459
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,829
one uh and my argument is that this is
not peculiar to the United

460
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
not peculiar to the United
 

461
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,310
not peculiar to the United
States uh if I'm China for example

462
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
States uh if I'm China for example
 

463
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,310
States uh if I'm China for example
today I would want to dominate Asia the

464
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:46,320
today I would want to dominate Asia the
 

465
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,350
today I would want to dominate Asia the
way the United States dominates the

466
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:48,360
way the United States dominates the
 

467
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,590
way the United States dominates the
Western Hemisphere they'd be fools not

468
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:50,600
Western Hemisphere they'd be fools not
 

469
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,389
Western Hemisphere they'd be fools not
to if I were Imperial Germany I'd want

470
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:53,399
to if I were Imperial Germany I'd want
 

471
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,509
to if I were Imperial Germany I'd want
to dominate all of Europe the way the

472
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
to dominate all of Europe the way the
 

473
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,430
to dominate all of Europe the way the
United States dominates the Western

474
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
United States dominates the Western
 

475
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,269
United States dominates the Western
Hemisphere why because if if you

476
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
Hemisphere why because if if you
 

477
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,629
Hemisphere why because if if you
dominate all of Europe assum your

478
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:01,639
dominate all of Europe assum your
 

479
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:04,710
dominate all of Europe assum your
Imperial Germany or Napoleonic France

then no other state in the area or in

482
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
then no other state in the area or in
 

483
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,030
then no other state in the area or in
the region can threaten you because

484
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
the region can threaten you because
 

485
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,790
the region can threaten you because
you're simply so powerful uh and again

486
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
you're simply so powerful uh and again
 

487
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,190
you're simply so powerful uh and again
what I'm saying here is that the

488
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:14,200
what I'm saying here is that the
 

489
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,110
what I'm saying here is that the
structure of the International System

490
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,120
structure of the International System
 

491
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,470
structure of the International System
really matters it's the fact that you're

492
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
really matters it's the fact that you're
 

493
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,150
really matters it's the fact that you're
in this anarchic system where survival

494
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,160
in this anarchic system where survival
 

495
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,870
in this anarchic system where survival
is your principal goal and where I can't

496
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:23,880
is your principal goal and where I can't

another state I can't know that it's
 

501
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,150
another state I can't know that it's
some point you might not come after me

502
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,160
some point you might not come after me
 

503
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,430
some point you might not come after me
you might and if you're really powerful

504
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:34,440
you might and if you're really powerful
 

505
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,069
you might and if you're really powerful
and I'm not I'm in deep trouble yeah so

506
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:39,079
and I'm not I'm in deep trouble yeah so
 

507
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,310
and I'm not I'm in deep trouble yeah so
some of the ideas underlying what you've

508
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,320
some of the ideas underlying what you've
 

509
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,870
some of the ideas underlying what you've
said uh offensive realism which I would

510
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
said uh offensive realism which I would
 

511
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,430
said uh offensive realism which I would
love to talk to you about sort of the

512
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:46,440
love to talk to you about sort of the
 

513
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,069
love to talk to you about sort of the
history of realism versus liberalism but

514
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:49,079
history of realism versus liberalism but
 

515
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,389
history of realism versus liberalism but
some of the ideas you already mentioned

516
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:51,399
some of the ideas you already mentioned
 

517
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,949
some of the ideas you already mentioned
uh Anarchy between

518
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:53,959
uh Anarchy between
 

519
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,069
uh Anarchy between
states everybody's trying to develop a

520
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
states everybody's trying to develop a
 

521
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,350
states everybody's trying to develop a
military capabilities uncertainty such

522
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
military capabilities uncertainty such
 

523
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,389
military capabilities uncertainty such
an interesting concept States cannot be

524
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
an interesting concept States cannot be
 

525
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,069
an interesting concept States cannot be
sure that other states will not use

526
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
sure that other states will not use
 

527
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,470
sure that other states will not use
military capabilities against them which

528
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
military capabilities against them which
 

529
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,750
military capabilities against them which
is it's of enormous importance story and

530
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
is it's of enormous importance story and
 

531
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,389
is it's of enormous importance story and
so interesting because you also say that

532
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:12,399
so interesting because you also say that
 

533
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,269
so interesting because you also say that
this makes realist more cautious and

534
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:14,279
this makes realist more cautious and
 

535
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,829
this makes realist more cautious and
more

536
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
more
 

537
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,110
more
peaceful the

538
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,120
peaceful the
 

539
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,189
peaceful the
uncertainty because of all the

540
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:20,199
uncertainty because of all the
 

541
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,389
uncertainty because of all the
uncertainty involved here it's better to

542
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:23,399
uncertainty involved here it's better to
 

543
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,670
uncertainty involved here it's better to
approach International politics with

544
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:26,680
approach International politics with
 

545
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,710
approach International politics with
caution is really interesting to think

546
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
caution is really interesting to think
 

547
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,710
caution is really interesting to think
about

548
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:29,720
about
 

549
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,150
about
uh again survival most States interested

550
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
uh again survival most States interested
 

551
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,750
uh again survival most States interested
in survival and the other interesting

552
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:33,760
in survival and the other interesting
 

553
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,870
in survival and the other interesting
thing is you assume all the states are

554
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880

 

555
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,990

rational um which most of the time most

00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,189
of the time you call this framework
offensive realism C can you just give a

560
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:48,199
offensive realism C can you just give a
 

561
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,350
offensive realism C can you just give a
overview of the history of the realism

562
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
overview of the history of the realism
 

563

theory is between realism and liberalism

574
00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:11,079
theory is between realism and liberalism
 

575
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:15,110
theory is between realism and liberalism
these are Tim honored bodies of theory

576
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
these are Tim honored bodies of theory
 

577
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,069
these are Tim honored bodies of theory
and before I tell you what I think the

578
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:17,079
and before I tell you what I think the
 

579
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:18,949
and before I tell you what I think the
differences are between those two bodies

580
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:18,959
differences are between those two bodies
 

581
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,910
differences are between those two bodies
of theory it is important to emphasize

582
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
of theory it is important to emphasize
 

583
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,350
of theory it is important to emphasize
that there are differences among

584
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:24,360
that there are differences among
 

585
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,110
that there are differences among
realists and differences among liberals

586
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
realists and differences among liberals
 

587
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,790
realists and differences among liberals
um and uh so when you talk about me as

588
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:32,800
um and uh so when you talk about me as
 

589
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,629
um and uh so when you talk about me as
an offensive realist you should

590
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
an offensive realist you should
 

591
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,150
an offensive realist you should
understand that there are also defensive

592
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
understand that there are also defensive
 

593
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,030
understand that there are also defensive
realists out there and there are uh a

594
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
realists out there and there are uh a
 

595
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,230
realists out there and there are uh a
panoply of liberal theories as well but

596
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,240
panoply of liberal theories as well but
 

597
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,710
panoply of liberal theories as well but
uh basically realists believe that power

598
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
uh basically realists believe that power
 

599
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,030
uh basically realists believe that power
matters that states compete for power

600
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,040
matters that states compete for power
 

601
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,790
matters that states compete for power
and that war is an instrument of

602
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:53,800
and that war is an instrument of
 

603
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,670
and that war is an instrument of
statecraft and uh uh liberals on the

604
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:57,680
statecraft and uh uh liberals on the
 

605
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,550
statecraft and uh uh liberals on the
other hand have what I would say is a

606
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:00,560
other hand have what I would say is a
 

607
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,189
other hand have what I would say is a
more idealistic view of the world uh

608
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
more idealistic view of the world uh
 

609
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,790
more idealistic view of the world uh
this is not to say that they're naive or

610
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:07,800
this is not to say that they're naive or
 

611
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,670
this is not to say that they're naive or
foolish but they believe there are

612
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:10,680
foolish but they believe there are
 

613
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,230
foolish but they believe there are
aspects of international

614
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,240
aspects of international
 

615
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,030
aspects of international
politics uh that lead to a less

616
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,040
politics uh that lead to a less
 

617
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,389
politics uh that lead to a less
competitive and more peaceful world than

618
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
competitive and more peaceful world than
 

619
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,990
competitive and more peaceful world than
most realists see uh and I'll lay out

620
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:25,000
most realists see uh and I'll lay out
 

621
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,310
most realists see uh and I'll lay out
for you very quickly what are the three

622
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
for you very quickly what are the three
 

623
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,550
for you very quickly what are the three
major major liberal theories today that

624
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:31,560
major major liberal theories today that
 

625
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,150
major major liberal theories today that
I think will give you a sense of the

626
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
I think will give you a sense of the
 

627
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,150
I think will give you a sense of the
more optimistic perspective that is

628
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,160
more optimistic perspective that is
 

629
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,230
more optimistic perspective that is
inherent in the liberal

630
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,240
inherent in the liberal
 

631
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,430
inherent in the liberal
Enterprise uh the first and most

632
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
Enterprise uh the first and most
 

633
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,590
Enterprise uh the first and most
important of the liberal theories is

634
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
important of the liberal theories is
 

635
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,990
important of the liberal theories is
democratic peace Theory and this is a

636
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,000
democratic peace Theory and this is a
 

637
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,670
democratic peace Theory and this is a
theory that says democracies do not

638
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:50,680
theory that says democracies do not
 

639
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,870
theory that says democracies do not
fight against other

640
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:52,880
fight against other
 

641
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,710
fight against other
democracies so the more the world is

642
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:55,720
democracies so the more the world is
 

643
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,870
democracies so the more the world is
populated with democracies the less

644
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:58,880
populated with democracies the less
 

645
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,910
populated with democracies the less
likely it is that we will have

646
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
likely it is that we will have
 

647
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,870
likely it is that we will have
wars uh and this basic argument is

648
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:04,880
wars uh and this basic argument is
 

649
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,509
wars uh and this basic argument is
inherent in Francis fukiyama is the end

650
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
inherent in Francis fukiyama is the end
 

651
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,990
inherent in Francis fukiyama is the end
of History he argues that democracy

652
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,000
of History he argues that democracy
 

653
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,389
of History he argues that democracy
Triumph first over fascism in the 20th

654
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
Triumph first over fascism in the 20th
 

655
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,509
Triumph first over fascism in the 20th
century it then triumphed over communism

656
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:18,519
century it then triumphed over communism
 

657
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,389
century it then triumphed over communism
and that means that in the future we're

658
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:21,399
and that means that in the future we're
 

659
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,749
and that means that in the future we're
have more and more liberal democracies

660
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:24,759
have more and more liberal democracies
 

661
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,990
have more and more liberal democracies
on the planet and if you have more and

662
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,000
on the planet and if you have more and
 

663
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,710
on the planet and if you have more and
more liberal democracies in those

664
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
more liberal democracies in those
 

665
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,189
more liberal democracies in those
democracies don't fight each other then

666
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
democracies don't fight each other then
 

667
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,670
democracies don't fight each other then
you have a more peaceful world that was

668
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:33,680
you have a more peaceful world that was
 

669
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,710
you have a more peaceful world that was
his argument it's a very liberal

670
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:35,720
his argument it's a very liberal
 

671
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,550
his argument it's a very liberal
argument a realist like me would say

672
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:39,560
argument a realist like me would say
 

673
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,269
argument a realist like me would say
that it doesn't matter whether a state

674
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:42,279
that it doesn't matter whether a state
 

675
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,030
that it doesn't matter whether a state
is a democracy or not all states behave

676
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
is a democracy or not all states behave
 

677
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,590
is a democracy or not all states behave
the same way because the structure of

00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
the same way because the structure of
 

679
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,629
the same way because the structure of
the system getting back to our earlier

00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:51,639
the system getting back to our earlier

682
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
discussion about International Anarchy
 

683
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,550
discussion about International Anarchy
the structure of the system leaves those

684
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,560
the structure of the system leaves those
 

685
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,069
the structure of the system leaves those
States no choice whether they're

686
00:15:59,069 --> 00:15:59,079
States no choice whether they're
 

687
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,710
States no choice whether they're
democracies or autocracies and again the

688
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:02,720
democracies or autocracies and again the
 

689
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,629
democracies or autocracies and again the
liberal view this first liberal theory

690
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:05,639
liberal view this first liberal theory
 

691
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,629
liberal view this first liberal theory
is that democracies don't fight other

692
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:07,639
is that democracies don't fight other
 

693
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,590
is that democracies don't fight other
democracies and therefore the more

694
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
democracies and therefore the more
 

695
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,629
democracies and therefore the more
democracies you have the more peaceful

696
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:11,639
democracies you have the more peaceful
 

697
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,189
democracies you have the more peaceful
the world can I just uh sort of try to

698
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:14,199
the world can I just uh sort of try to
 

699
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,150
the world can I just uh sort of try to
unpack that a little bit so on the

700
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,160
unpack that a little bit so on the
 

701
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,389
unpack that a little bit so on the
Democratic peace Theory I guess would

702
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:19,399
Democratic peace Theory I guess would
 

703
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,230
Democratic peace Theory I guess would
say that in democracies leaders are

704
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
say that in democracies leaders are
 

705
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,910
say that in democracies leaders are
elected and the underlying assumption is

706
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:24,920
elected and the underlying assumption is
 

707
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,069
elected and the underlying assumption is
most people want peace and so they will

708
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
most people want peace and so they will
 

709
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,790
most people want peace and so they will
elect peacemakers so the more you

710
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
elect peacemakers so the more you
 

711
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,509
elect peacemakers so the more you
democracies you have the more likely you

712
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:32,519
democracies you have the more likely you
 

713
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,069
democracies you have the more likely you
have peace and then the realist

714
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:35,079
have peace and then the realist
 

715
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,749
have peace and then the realist
perspective what says that it doesn't

716
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
perspective what says that it doesn't
 

717
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,350
perspective what says that it doesn't
matter if the majority of people want

718
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
matter if the majority of people want
 

719
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,550
matter if the majority of people want
peace the

720
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:41,560
peace the
 

721
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,150
peace the
structure of international politics is

722
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
structure of international politics is
 

723
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,710
structure of international politics is
such that superpowers want to become

724
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:47,720
such that superpowers want to become
 

725
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,350
such that superpowers want to become
more Super and powerful and they do that

726
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:50,360
more Super and powerful and they do that
 

727
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,910
more Super and powerful and they do that
through War you can't make that argument

728
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:52,920
through War you can't make that argument
 

729
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,030
through War you can't make that argument
that you're making about democracies

730
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
that you're making about democracies
 

731
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,949
that you're making about democracies
because if you're saying that

732
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
because if you're saying that
 

733
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,790
because if you're saying that
democracies are inclined toward toward

734
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
democracies are inclined toward toward
 

735
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,350
democracies are inclined toward toward
peace and the the electorate picks

736
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
peace and the the electorate picks
 

737
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,069
peace and the the electorate picks
leaders who are inclined towards peace

738
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,079
leaders who are inclined towards peace
 

739
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,909
leaders who are inclined towards peace
then you have to show that democracies

740
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:09,919
then you have to show that democracies
 

741
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,270
then you have to show that democracies
are in general more peaceful than

742
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
are in general more peaceful than
 

743
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,029
are in general more peaceful than
non-democracies and you can't support

744
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:16,039
non-democracies and you can't support
 

745
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,189
non-democracies and you can't support
that argument you can find lots of

746
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
that argument you can find lots of
 

747
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,669
that argument you can find lots of
evidence to support the argument that

748
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:21,679
evidence to support the argument that
 

749
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,309
evidence to support the argument that
democracies don't fight other

750
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
democracies don't fight other
 

751
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,789
democracies don't fight other
democracies so the argument I believe

752
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:27,799
democracies so the argument I believe
 

753
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,909
democracies so the argument I believe
that you have to make if you're going to

754
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
that you have to make if you're going to
 

755
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,909
that you have to make if you're going to
support Democratic peace Theory the main

756
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
support Democratic peace Theory the main
 

757
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,430
support Democratic peace Theory the main
argument you have to make

758
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:34,440
argument you have to make
 

759
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,190
argument you have to make
is that liberal

760
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,200
is that liberal
 

761
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,830
is that liberal
democracies have a healthy respect for

762
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:40,840
democracies have a healthy respect for
 

763
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,470
democracies have a healthy respect for
each other and they can assess each

764
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
each other and they can assess each
 

765
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,669
each other and they can assess each
others intentions if you're a liberal

766
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:46,679
others intentions if you're a liberal
 

767
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,470
others intentions if you're a liberal
democracy and I'm a liberal democracy we

768
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,480
democracy and I'm a liberal democracy we
 

769
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,870
democracy and I'm a liberal democracy we
know we have value systems that argue

770
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:53,880
know we have value systems that argue
 

771
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,149
know we have value systems that argue
against aggression and argue for

772
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:57,159
against aggression and argue for
 

773
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,710
against aggression and argue for
peaceful resolution of of Crisis and

774
00:17:59,710 --> 00:17:59,720
peaceful resolution of of Crisis and
 

775
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,149
peaceful resolution of of Crisis and
therefore given these Norms we can trust

776
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:03,159
therefore given these Norms we can trust
 

777
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:05,750
therefore given these Norms we can trust
each other we can know each other's

778
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
each other we can know each other's
 

779
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,230
each other we can know each other's
intentions remember for realists like me

780
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
intentions remember for realists like me
 

781
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,549
intentions remember for realists like me
uncertainty about intentions really

782
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:10,559
uncertainty about intentions really
 

783
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,990
uncertainty about intentions really
helps Drive the train but if you're

784
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,000
helps Drive the train but if you're
 

785
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,549
helps Drive the train but if you're
talking about two

786
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
talking about two
 

787
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,430
talking about two
democracies right the argument there is

788
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,440
democracies right the argument there is
 

789
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,590
democracies right the argument there is
that they know each other's intentions

790
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
that they know each other's intentions
 

791
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,710
that they know each other's intentions
and for you sure maybe democracies

792
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720
and for you sure maybe democracies
 

793
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,549
and for you sure maybe democracies
reduce uncertainty a little bit but not

794
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
reduce uncertainty a little bit but not
 

795
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,029
reduce uncertainty a little bit but not
enough to stop the train I think that's

796
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
enough to stop the train I think that's
 

797
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,430
enough to stop the train I think that's
right yeah that's that that's right so

798
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
right yeah that's that that's right so
 

799
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,430
right yeah that's that that's right so
that's Democratic peace theory yes the

800
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
that's Democratic peace theory yes the
 

801
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,789
that's Democratic peace theory yes the
second theory is economic

802
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:32,799
second theory is economic
 

803
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,710
second theory is economic
interdependence Theory and that's the

804
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:34,720
interdependence Theory and that's the
 

805
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,310
interdependence Theory and that's the
argument that in a globalized world like

806
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,320
argument that in a globalized world like
 

807
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,990
argument that in a globalized world like
the one that we live in and have lived

808
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
the one that we live in and have lived
 

809
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,310
the one that we live in and have lived
in for a long time there's a great deal

810
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
in for a long time there's a great deal
 

811
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,430
in for a long time there's a great deal
of economic interdependence and if you

812
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:44,440
of economic interdependence and if you
 

813
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,669
of economic interdependence and if you
and I are two

814
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
and I are two
 

815
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,870
and I are two
countries uh or if you and me are two

816
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:47,880
countries uh or if you and me are two
 

817
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,190
countries uh or if you and me are two
countries and uh we're economically

818
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,200
countries and uh we're economically
 

819
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,590
countries and uh we're economically
interdependent and we're both getting

820
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:52,600
interdependent and we're both getting
 

821
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,029
interdependent and we're both getting
prosperous as a result of this economic

822
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
prosperous as a result of this economic
 

823
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,909
prosperous as a result of this economic
intercourse the last thing that we're

824
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:56,919
intercourse the last thing that we're
 

825
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,029
intercourse the last thing that we're
going to do is start a war either one of

826
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
going to do is start a war either one of
 

827
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,310
going to do is start a war either one of
us because who would kill the goose that

828
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:01,320
us because who would kill the goose that
 

829
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,549
us because who would kill the goose that
lays the golden eggs it's that kind of

830
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:03,559
lays the golden eggs it's that kind of
 

831
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,950
lays the golden eggs it's that kind of
argument so there you have an argument

832
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:05,960
argument so there you have an argument
 

833
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,270
argument so there you have an argument
that economic interdependence leads to

834
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:08,280
that economic interdependence leads to
 

835
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,710
that economic interdependence leads to
peace and then the third liberal

836
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
peace and then the third liberal
 

837
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,789
peace and then the third liberal
argument has to do with

838
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
argument has to do with
 

839
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,149
argument has to do with
institutions uh sometimes referred to as

840
00:19:15,149 --> 00:19:15,159
institutions uh sometimes referred to as
 

841
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,350
institutions uh sometimes referred to as
liberal institutionalism and this is the

842
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:17,360
liberal institutionalism and this is the
 

843
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,710
liberal institutionalism and this is the
argument that if you can get States into

844
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
argument that if you can get States into
 

845
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,870
argument that if you can get States into
institutions where they become rule

846
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:23,880
institutions where they become rule
 

847
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,549
institutions where they become rule
abiding

848
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:25,559
abiding
 

849
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:29,590
abiding
actors they will obey the rules that

850
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
actors they will obey the rules that
 

851
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,029
actors they will obey the rules that
dictate that war is not

852
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
dictate that war is not
 

853
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,710
dictate that war is not
acceptable uh so if you get them to

854
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:35,720
acceptable uh so if you get them to
 

855
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,110
acceptable uh so if you get them to
accept uh uh the UN rules on when you

856
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
accept uh uh the UN rules on when you
 

857
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,310
accept uh uh the UN rules on when you
can and cannot initiate a war uh then

858
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,320
can and cannot initiate a war uh then
 

859
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,789
can and cannot initiate a war uh then
you'll have a more peaceful world so

860
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:47,799
you'll have a more peaceful world so
 

861
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:50,669
you'll have a more peaceful world so
those are the liberal theories and as

862
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:50,679
those are the liberal theories and as
 

863
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,230
those are the liberal theories and as
you can tell they're very different from

864
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,240
you can tell they're very different from
 

865
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,390
you can tell they're very different from
realism as articulated by somebody like

866
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
realism as articulated by somebody like
 

867
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,990
realism as articulated by somebody like
me can you uh maybe argue against the

868
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
me can you uh maybe argue against the
 

869
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,750
me can you uh maybe argue against the
economic interdependence and in the

870
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:02,760
economic interdependence and in the
 

871
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,789
economic interdependence and in the
institutions that institutions follow

872
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
institutions that institutions follow
 

873
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,669
institutions that institutions follow
rules um a little bit so the the the

874
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:08,679
rules um a little bit so the the the
 

875
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:11,190
rules um a little bit so the the the
Golden Goose with a golden egg you're

876
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:11,200
Golden Goose with a golden egg you're
 

877
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,830
Golden Goose with a golden egg you're
saying that nations are happy to kill

878
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:14,840
saying that nations are happy to kill
 

879
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,590
saying that nations are happy to kill
the goose because again they want Power

880
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:19,600
the goose because again they want Power
 

881
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,870
the goose because again they want Power
if they think it's necessary to kill the

882
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:21,880
if they think it's necessary to kill the
 

883
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,710
if they think it's necessary to kill the
Golden Goose yeah because of security

884
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:25,720
Golden Goose yeah because of security
 

885
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,149
Golden Goose yeah because of security
concerns they will do it the point is

886
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:29,159
concerns they will do it the point is
 

887
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:31,990
concerns they will do it the point is
that economic

888
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
that economic
 

889
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,549
that economic
interdependence at its root has

890
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:35,559
interdependence at its root has
 

891
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:39,110
interdependence at its root has
Prosperity as the core variable yeah in

892
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
Prosperity as the core variable yeah in
 

893
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,270
Prosperity as the core variable yeah in
the realest story The Core variable is

894
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
the realest story The Core variable is
 

895
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,470
the realest story The Core variable is
survival and survival always trumps

896
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:47,480
survival and survival always trumps
 

897
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,230
survival and survival always trumps
Prosperity so if you go back to the

898
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:51,240
Prosperity so if you go back to the
 

899
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,149
Prosperity so if you go back to the
period before World War I we're in

900
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:54,159
period before World War I we're in
 

901
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,149
period before World War I we're in
Europe it's

902
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
Europe it's
 

903
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,630
Europe it's
1913 or early 19

904
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:58,640
1913 or early 19
 

905
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,990
1913 or early 19
14 what you see is that you have an

906
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,000
14 what you see is that you have an
 

907
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,270
14 what you see is that you have an
intense security competition between all

908
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,280
intense security competition between all
 

909
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,789
intense security competition between all
of the great powers on one side you have

910
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:07,799
of the great powers on one side you have
 

911
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,029
of the great powers on one side you have
the Triple Alliance and on the other

912
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:10,039
the Triple Alliance and on the other
 

913
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,269
the Triple Alliance and on the other
side you have the triple onon you have

914
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:12,279
side you have the triple onon you have
 

915
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:14,230
side you have the triple onon you have
these two alliances and you have an

916
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
these two alliances and you have an
 

917
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,510
these two alliances and you have an
intense security competition between

918
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:16,520
intense security competition between
 

919
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,669
intense security competition between
them okay at the same time you have a

920
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
them okay at the same time you have a
 

921
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,750
them okay at the same time you have a
great deal of economic interdependence

922
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:21,760
great deal of economic interdependence
 

923
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,350
great deal of economic interdependence
it's amazing how much economic

924
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
it's amazing how much economic
 

925
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,350
it's amazing how much economic
intercourse is taking place in Europe

926
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:26,360
intercourse is taking place in Europe
 

927
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,029
intercourse is taking place in Europe
among all the actors right and people

928
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:29,039
among all the actors right and people
 

929
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,710
among all the actors right and people
are getting prosperous or countries are

930
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
are getting prosperous or countries are
 

931
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,669
are getting prosperous or countries are
getting prosperous as a result but

932
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
getting prosperous as a result but
 

933
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,590
getting prosperous as a result but
nevertheless in the famous July crisis

934
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:36,600
nevertheless in the famous July crisis
 

935
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,350
nevertheless in the famous July crisis
of

936
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:37,360
of
 

937
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,029
of
1914 this economic Prosperity is unable

938
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:41,039
1914 this economic Prosperity is unable
 

939
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,149
1914 this economic Prosperity is unable
to prevent World War I because security

940
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
to prevent World War I because security
 

941
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,750
to prevent World War I because security
concerns or survival is more important

942
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
concerns or survival is more important
 

943
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,630
concerns or survival is more important
uh so there are you know going to be

944
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
uh so there are you know going to be
 

945
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,190
uh so there are you know going to be
lots of situations where prosperity and

946
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
lots of situations where prosperity and
 

947
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,630
lots of situations where prosperity and
survival come into conflict and in those

948
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
survival come into conflict and in those
 

949
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,710
survival come into conflict and in those
cases survival will win and uh maybe you

950
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
cases survival will win and uh maybe you
 

951
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,789
cases survival will win and uh maybe you
can speak to the different camps of

952
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:03,799
can speak to the different camps of
 

953
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,190
can speak to the different camps of
realists you said offensive and

954
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,200
realists you said offensive and
 

955
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,909
realists you said offensive and
defensive can you draw a distinction

956
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
defensive can you draw a distinction
 

957
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,510
defensive can you draw a distinction
between those two yeah let me just back

958
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:10,520
between those two yeah let me just back
 

959
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,190
between those two yeah let me just back
up a bit on that one and you were

960
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,200
up a bit on that one and you were
 

961
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,269
up a bit on that one and you were
talking about Will To Power before uh

962
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:17,279
talking about Will To Power before uh
 

963
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,029
talking about Will To Power before uh
the first big

964
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
the first big
 

965
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,190
the first big
divide between realists is structural

966
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
divide between realists is structural
 

967

00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:01,190
competition and War what dri drives
competition in war is the structure of

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:01,200
competition in war is the structure of
 

993
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,870
competition in war is the structure of
the system it's Anarchy so you're not as

the system it's Anarchy so you're not as
 

995
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,470
the system it's Anarchy so you're not as

yeah there's just a a world of

998
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
yeah there's just a a world of
 

999
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,390
yeah there's just a a world of
difference between the two sure it's

1000
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
difference between the two sure it's
 

1001
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,549
difference between the two sure it's
just important to understand that so

1002
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:12,559
just important to understand that so
 

1003
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,070
just important to understand that so
within that this from the structural

1004
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:15,080
within that this from the structural
 

1005
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,669
within that this from the structural
that there's a subdivision also of

1006
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:16,679
that there's a subdivision also of
 

1007
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,830
that there's a subdivision also of
offensive and defensive yes inside the

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:18,840
offensive and defensive yes inside the
 

1009
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,390
offensive and defensive yes inside the
structural realist world right and you

1010
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:23,400
structural realist world right and you
 

1011
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,029
structural realist world right and you
have a handful of realists who believe

1012
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
have a handful of realists who believe
 

1013
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,230
have a handful of realists who believe
that the structure of the

1014
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:31,240
that the structure of the
 

1015
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,830
that the structure of the
system Fosters competition for sure

1016
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:34,840
system Fosters competition for sure
 

1017
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,950
system Fosters competition for sure
security competition but it really rules

1018
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
security competition but it really rules
 

1019
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,149
security competition but it really rules
out great power War almost all the time

1020
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:44,159
out great power War almost all the time
 

1021
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,390
out great power War almost all the time
so it makes sense to care about the

1022
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:47,400
so it makes sense to care about the
 

1023
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,310
so it makes sense to care about the
balance of power but to focus on

1024
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,320
balance of power but to focus on
 

1025
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,750
balance of power but to focus on
maintaining how much power you have

1026
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
maintaining how much power you have
 

1027
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,669
maintaining how much power you have
that's the defense of realism

1028
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:55,679
that's the defense of realism
 

1029
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,510
that's the defense of realism
maintaining how much power you have not

1030
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:58,520
maintaining how much power you have not
 

1031
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,070
maintaining how much power you have not
trying to gain more power because the

1032
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,080
trying to gain more power because the
 

1033
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,430
trying to gain more power because the
argument the defensive realists make is

1034
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
argument the defensive realists make is
 

1035
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,230
argument the defensive realists make is
that if you try to gain more power the

1036
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
that if you try to gain more power the
 

1037
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,669
that if you try to gain more power the
system will punish you the structure

1038
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:08,679
system will punish you the structure
 

1039
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,029
system will punish you the structure
will punish

1040
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:10,039
will punish
 

1041
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:14,029
will punish
you I'm not a defensive realist I'm an

1042
00:24:14,029 --> 00:24:14,039
you I'm not a defensive realist I'm an
 

1043
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,750
you I'm not a defensive realist I'm an
offensive realist and my argument is

1044
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:16,760
offensive realist and my argument is
 

1045
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,230
offensive realist and my argument is
that states look for

1046
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,240
that states look for
 

1047
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,430
that states look for
opportunities to gain more power and

1048
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:22,440
opportunities to gain more power and
 

1049
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,310
opportunities to gain more power and
every time they see or almost every time

1050
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320
every time they see or almost every time
 

1051
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,830
every time they see or almost every time
they see an opportunity to gain more

1052
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:28,840
they see an opportunity to gain more
 

1053
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,149
they see an opportunity to gain more
power um and they think the likelihood

1054
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:31,159
power um and they think the likelihood
 

1055
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,389
power um and they think the likelihood
of success is high and the cost will not

1056
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:34,399
of success is high and the cost will not
 

1057
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,830
of success is high and the cost will not
be great they'll jump at that

1058
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:38,840
be great they'll jump at that
 

1059
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,269
be great they'll jump at that
opportunity just to linger on the human

1060
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:41,279
opportunity just to linger on the human

how do you explain that in the framework

how do you explain that in the framework

realism well I think that Nazi Germany

1080
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:07,559
realism well I think that Nazi Germany
 

1081
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,710
realism well I think that Nazi Germany
was driven in large part by structural

1082
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
was driven in large part by structural
 

1083
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,870
was driven in large part by structural
considerations and I think if you look

1084
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
considerations and I think if you look
 

1085
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,669
considerations and I think if you look
at Imperial Germany which was largely

1086
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:15,679
at Imperial Germany which was largely
 

1087
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,029
at Imperial Germany which was largely
responsible for starting World War I and

1088
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:18,039
responsible for starting World War I and
 

1089
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,630
responsible for starting World War I and
of course Nazi Germany is largely

1090
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:19,640
of course Nazi Germany is largely
 

1091
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,750
of course Nazi Germany is largely
responsible for starting World War II

1092
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:22,760
responsible for starting World War II
 

1093
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,149
responsible for starting World War II
what that tells you is you didn't need

1094
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:24,159
what that tells you is you didn't need
 

1095
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,029
what that tells you is you didn't need
Adolf Hitler to start World War I right

1096
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:27,039
Adolf Hitler to start World War I right
 

1097
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,630
Adolf Hitler to start World War I right
and I believe that there is a good

1098
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:29,640
and I believe that there is a good
 

1099
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,029
and I believe that there is a good
chance you would have had World War II

1100
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:32,039
chance you would have had World War II
 

1101
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:35,389
chance you would have had World War II
in the absence of Hitler right I believe

1102
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:35,399
in the absence of Hitler right I believe
 

1103
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:38,269
in the absence of Hitler right I believe
that Germany was very powerful it was

1104
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:38,279
that Germany was very powerful it was
 

1105
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,950
that Germany was very powerful it was
deeply worried about the balance of

1106
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:39,960
deeply worried about the balance of
 

1107
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,070
deeply worried about the balance of
power in Europe and it had strong

1108
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,080
power in Europe and it had strong
 

1109
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,269
power in Europe and it had strong
incentives to behave

1110
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:45,279
incentives to behave
 

1111
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,029
incentives to behave
aggressively uh in in the late 1930s

1112
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:49,039
aggressively uh in in the late 1930s
 

1113
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,110
aggressively uh in in the late 1930s
early

1114
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,120
early
 

1115
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,190
early
1940s so I I believe that structure

1116
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:53,200
1940s so I I believe that structure
 

1117
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,870
1940s so I I believe that structure
mattered however I want to qualify that

1118
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:55,880
mattered however I want to qualify that
 

1119
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,350
mattered however I want to qualify that
in the case of Adolf hler because I do

1120
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
in the case of Adolf hler because I do
 

1121
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,909
in the case of Adolf hler because I do
think he had what you would call a Will

1122
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:01,919
think he had what you would call a Will
 

1123
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,630
think he had what you would call a Will
To Power I've never used that word to

1124
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:04,640
To Power I've never used that word to
 

1125
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,029
To Power I've never used that word to
describe him before but it's consistent

1126
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
describe him before but it's consistent
 

1127
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,029
describe him before but it's consistent
with my point that I often make that

1128
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:10,039
with my point that I often make that
 

1129
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,190
with my point that I often make that
there are two leaders or there have been

1130
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,200
there are two leaders or there have been
 

1131
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,710
there are two leaders or there have been
two leaders in modern history who are

1132
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
two leaders in modern history who are
 

1133
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,950
two leaders in modern history who are

the other was Hitler now if you want to

1138
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
the other was Hitler now if you want to
 

1139
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,710
the other was Hitler now if you want to
call that a Will To Power you can do

1140
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:25,720
call that a Will To Power you can do
 

1141
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,070
call that a Will To Power you can do
that I I'm more comfortable referring to

1142
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
that I I'm more comfortable referring to
 

1143
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,230
that I I'm more comfortable referring to
Hitler As A congenital aggressor and

1144
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,240
Hitler As A congenital aggressor and
 

1145
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,549
Hitler As A congenital aggressor and
referring to Napoleon As A congenital

aggressor although there were important
 

1149
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,830
aggressor although there were important
differences between the two because

1150
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:36,840
differences between the two because
 

1151
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,909
differences between the two because
Hitler was probably the most murderous

1152
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
Hitler was probably the most murderous
 

1153
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,990

leader uh in recorded history and
 

1155
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,029
leader uh in recorded history and
Napoleon was not in that category at all

1156
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:47,039
Napoleon was not in that category at all
 

1157
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,389
Napoleon was not in that category at all
uh but but both of them uh were uh

uh but but both of them uh were uh
 

1159
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:52,950
uh but but both of them uh were uh
driven by what you would call a Will To

the structural argument in Hitler's case
 

1165
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,070
the structural argument in Hitler's case
and also in Napoleon's case is there

1166
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,080
and also in Napoleon's case is there
 

1167
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,590
and also in Napoleon's case is there
some degree on the human psychology side

1168
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
some degree on the human psychology side
 

1169
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,830
some degree on the human psychology side
that

1170

what happened after World War I led to

1174

what happened after World War I led to
 

1175
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,110

Hitler wielding so much power and then
 

1177
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,870
Hitler wielding so much power and then
Hitler starting World War II so this is

1178
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:17,880
Hitler starting World War II so this is
 

1179
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,710
Hitler starting World War II so this is
the The Human Side perhaps the reason I

1180
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:20,720
the The Human Side perhaps the reason I
 

1181
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,269
the The Human Side perhaps the reason I
asked that question is also because you

1182
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:22,279
asked that question is also because you
 

1183
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,190
asked that question is also because you
mentioned the century of humiliation on

1184
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:24,200
mentioned the century of humiliation on
 

1185
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,789
mentioned the century of humiliation on
the China side so to so to which degree

1186
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:27,799
the China side so to so to which degree
 

1187
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,389
the China side so to so to which degree
the

1188
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:29,399
the
 

1189
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,870
the
humiliation lead to Hitler and lead to

1190
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:31,880
humiliation lead to Hitler and lead to
 

1191
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,149
humiliation lead to Hitler and lead to
World War I well the question of what

1192
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:34,159
World War I well the question of what
 

1193
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,830
World War I well the question of what
led to Hitler is a very different

1194
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:36,840
led to Hitler is a very different
 

1195
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,789
led to Hitler is a very different
question than the question of what led

1196
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:38,799
question than the question of what led
 

1197
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,630
question than the question of what led
to World War II once Hitler was in power

1198
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:41,640
to World War II once Hitler was in power
 

1199
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,029
to World War II once Hitler was in power
I mean after January 30th 1933 he's in

1200
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
I mean after January 30th 1933 he's in
 

1201
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,310
I mean after January 30th 1933 he's in
power and then the question of what is

1202
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,320
power and then the question of what is
 

1203
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,310
power and then the question of what is
driving him comes racing to the four uh

1204
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,320
driving him comes racing to the four uh
 

1205
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,070
driving him comes racing to the four uh
is their resentment over the Versa

1206
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
is their resentment over the Versa
 

1207
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,669
is their resentment over the Versa
treaty and what happened to Germany yes

1208
00:27:57,669 --> 00:27:57,679
treaty and what happened to Germany yes
 

1209
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,350
treaty and what happened to Germany yes
did that matter yes but my argument is

1210
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:01,360
did that matter yes but my argument is
 

1211
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,350
did that matter yes but my argument is
that structure was the principal Factor

1212
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:05,360
that structure was the principal Factor
 

1213
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,630
that structure was the principal Factor
uh driving the train in Hitler's case

1214
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:08,640
uh driving the train in Hitler's case
 

1215
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,269
uh driving the train in Hitler's case
but what I'm saying here is that there

1216
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
but what I'm saying here is that there
 

1217
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,750
but what I'm saying here is that there
were other factors at well as well

1218
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
were other factors at well as well
 

1219
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,710
were other factors at well as well
resentment being one of them will to

1220
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:15,720
resentment being one of them will to
 

1221
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,870
resentment being one of them will to
power or the fact that he was A

1222
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:17,880
power or the fact that he was A
 

1223
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,870
power or the fact that he was A
congenital aggressor in my lexicon uh

1224
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:21,880
congenital aggressor in my lexicon uh
 

1225
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,669
congenital aggressor in my lexicon uh
certainly mattered as well so I I don't

1226
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:24,679
certainly mattered as well so I I don't
 

1227
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,070
certainly mattered as well so I I don't
want to dismiss um your point

1228
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
want to dismiss um your point
 

1229
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,269
want to dismiss um your point
uh about resentment so Hitler in

1230
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:30,279
uh about resentment so Hitler in
 

1231
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:33,310
uh about resentment so Hitler in
particular the way he wielded the way he

1232
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:33,320
particular the way he wielded the way he
 

1233
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,029
particular the way he wielded the way he
gained so much power might have

1234
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
gained so much power might have
 

1235
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,430
gained so much power might have
been the general resentment of the

1236
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:39,440
been the general resentment of the
 

1237
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,710
been the general resentment of the
populace of the German populace I think

1238
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
populace of the German populace I think
 

1239
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,190
populace of the German populace I think
that uh as a result of um defeating

1240
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,200
that uh as a result of um defeating
 

1241
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,350
that uh as a result of um defeating
World War I and all the trials and

1242
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:48,360
World War I and all the trials and
 

1243
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,509
World War I and all the trials and
tribulations associated with viar

1244
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:50,519
tribulations associated with viar
 

1245
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:54,029
tribulations associated with viar
Germany and then the coming of uh the

1246
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:54,039
Germany and then the coming of uh the
 

1247
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,190
Germany and then the coming of uh the
Great Depression all of those factors

1248
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,200
Great Depression all of those factors
 

1249
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,190
Great Depression all of those factors
death definitely account for his coming

1250
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200
death definitely account for his coming
 

1251
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,830
death definitely account for his coming
to power I think that one of the

1252
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:02,840
to power I think that one of the
 

1253
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,909
to power I think that one of the
reasons um that he was so successful at

1254
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
reasons um that he was so successful at
 

1255
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,389
reasons um that he was so successful at
winning over the German people once he

1256
00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:11,399
winning over the German people once he
 

1257
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:12,590
winning over the German people once he
came to

1258
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:12,600
came to
 

1259
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,430
came to
power uh was because there was a great

1260
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:16,440
power uh was because there was a great
 

1261
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,990
power uh was because there was a great
deal of resentment uh in the German body

1262
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,000
deal of resentment uh in the German body
 

1263
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,190
deal of resentment uh in the German body
politic and he played on that resentment

1264
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,200
politic and he played on that resentment
 

1265
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,389
politic and he played on that resentment
that surely helped him get elected too

1266
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:25,399
that surely helped him get elected too
 

1267
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,549
that surely helped him get elected too
but I think uh having studied the case

1268
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:28,559
but I think uh having studied the case
 

1269
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,870
but I think uh having studied the case
it was even more important once he took

1270
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:31,880
it was even more important once he took
 

1271
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,110
it was even more important once he took
over I also believe that one of the

1272
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
over I also believe that one of the
 

1273
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,389
over I also believe that one of the
principle reasons that he was so popular

1274
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:38,399
principle reasons that he was so popular
 

1275
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,070
principle reasons that he was so popular
and he was wildly popular inside Nazi

1276
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,080
and he was wildly popular inside Nazi
 

1277
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,350
and he was wildly popular inside Nazi
Germany is because he was the only

1278
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
Germany is because he was the only
 

1279
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,269
Germany is because he was the only
leader of an industrialized country who

1280
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:45,279
leader of an industrialized country who
 

1281
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,110
leader of an industrialized country who
pulled this country out of the

1282
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
pulled this country out of the
 

1283
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,630
pulled this country out of the
depression uh and that really

before for the thought of starting
another European War uh was not

another European War uh was not
 

1441
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,509
another European War uh was not
especially attractive to lots of German

1442
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:33,519
especially attractive to lots of German
 

1443
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,149
especially attractive to lots of German
policy makers including military

1444
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
policy makers including military
 

1445
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,950
policy makers including military
leaders and then came France 1940 in the

1446
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:39,960
leaders and then came France 1940 in the
 

1447
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,830
leaders and then came France 1940 in the
runup to May 10th 1940 uh there was huge

1448
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:44,840
runup to May 10th 1940 uh there was huge
 

1449
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,870
runup to May 10th 1940 uh there was huge
resistance uh in the uh German Army to

1450
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:48,880
resistance uh in the uh German Army to
 

1451
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,029
resistance uh in the uh German Army to
attacking France uh but that was

1452
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
attacking France uh but that was
 

1453
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,269
attacking France uh but that was
eventually eliminated because they came

1454
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:55,279
eventually eliminated because they came
 

1455
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,029
eventually eliminated because they came
up with a clever plan uh the manstein

1456
00:33:59,029 --> 00:33:59,039
up with a clever plan uh the manstein
 

1457
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,789
up with a clever plan uh the manstein
plan if you look at the decision to

1458
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:01,799
plan if you look at the decision to
 

1459
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,629
plan if you look at the decision to
invade the Soviet Union on June 22nd

1460
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:04,639
invade the Soviet Union on June 22nd
 

1461
00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:07,509
invade the Soviet Union on June 22nd
1941 which is the only case where they

1462
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:07,519
1941 which is the only case where they
 

1463
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,790
1941 which is the only case where they
fail they succeeded in France they

fail they succeeded in France they
 

1465
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,310
fail they succeeded in France they
succeeded in Poland they succeeded uh at

1466
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:13,320
succeeded in Poland they succeeded uh at
 

1467
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,669
succeeded in Poland they succeeded uh at
Munich in

1468
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:14,679
Munich in
 

1469
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,270
Munich in
1938 Soviet Union is where they fail

1470
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:17,280
1938 Soviet Union is where they fail
 

1471
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,829
1938 Soviet Union is where they fail
there's hardly any resistance at all

1472
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:19,839
there's hardly any resistance at all
 

1473
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:22,030
there's hardly any resistance at all
right yeah well and to say that they

1474
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:22,040
right yeah well and to say that they
 

1475
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,109
right yeah well and to say that they
failed the Soviet Union I mean my

1476
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:24,119
failed the Soviet Union I mean my

1481
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,470
Soviet Union you know there's a lot of
successes early on so there's poor

since they came terrifyingly close to
 

1505
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,829

winning uh you could make the opposite

00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:01,839
winning uh you could make the opposite
 

1507
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,069

argument that they were doomed uh but uh

00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:05,079
argument that they were doomed uh but uh
 

1509
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,829

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,670
I I'm not terribly comfortable making
that argument I think the ver mocked by

00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,680
that argument I think the ver mocked by
 

1513
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,390
that argument I think the ver mocked by
the summer of

the summer of
 

1515
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,670
the summer of
1941 was a finally tuned instrument for

terrible shape uh Stalin had purged the

00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:24,280
terrible shape uh Stalin had purged the

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,710

poorly in Finland uh and uh there were

poorly in Finland uh and uh there were
 

1525
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,069
poorly in Finland uh and uh there were
all sorts of reasons to think that they

1526
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:34,079
all sorts of reasons to think that they
 

1527
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,230
all sorts of reasons to think that they
were no match for the verock and if you

1528
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,240
were no match for the verock and if you
 

1529
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,190
were no match for the verock and if you
look at what happened in the initial

1530
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,200
look at what happened in the initial
 

1531
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,630
look at what happened in the initial
stages of the conflict that proved to be

00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:41,640
stages of the conflict that proved to be
 

1533
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,510
stages of the conflict that proved to be
the case uh the Germans won a lot of

1534
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:45,520
the case uh the Germans won a lot of
 

1535
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,510
the case uh the Germans won a lot of
significant tactical victories early on

00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,520
significant tactical victories early on
 

1537
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,510
significant tactical victories early on
and if they focused and went to Moscow

1538
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:51,520
and if they focused and went to Moscow
 

1539
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,430
and if they focused and went to Moscow
as quickly as possible it's again

00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
as quickly as possible it's again
 

1541
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,790
as quickly as possible it's again
terrifyingly so could have been a

terrifyingly so could have been a

basically topple topple

basically topple topple
Stalin um and one thing that's that's

1546
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:04,119
Stalin um and one thing that's that's
 

1547

00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,270
possible that's possible fortunately
we're not going to run the experiment

1550
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
we're not going to run the experiment
 

1551
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,230
we're not going to run the experiment
again but one could argue that that had

1552
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,240
again but one could argue that that had
 

1553
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,829

they concentrated as the generals wanted

1554
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
they concentrated as the generals wanted
 

1555
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,109
they concentrated as the generals wanted
to do in going straight for Moscow that

1556
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:17,119
to do in going straight for Moscow that
 

1557
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,829
to do in going straight for Moscow that
they would have won I mean what Hitler

1558
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:18,839
they would have won I mean what Hitler
 

1559
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,150
they would have won I mean what Hitler
wanted to do is he he wanted to go into

1560
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:21,160
wanted to do is he he wanted to go into
 

1561
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,430
wanted to do is he he wanted to go into
the Ukraine I mean Hitler thought that

1562
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,440
the Ukraine I mean Hitler thought that
 

1563
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,510
the Ukraine I mean Hitler thought that
the main axis uh there were three axes

1564
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:26,520
the main axis uh there were three axes
 

1565
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,030
the main axis uh there were three axes
the Northern axis went towards Leningrad

1566
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,040
the Northern axis went towards Leningrad
 

1567
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,790
the Northern axis went towards Leningrad
the central axis of course went to

1568
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
the central axis of course went to
 

1569
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,910
the central axis of course went to
Moscow and then the southern axis Army

1570
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:33,920
Moscow and then the southern axis Army
 

1571
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,950
Moscow and then the southern axis Army
group South uh headed towards Ukraine

1572
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:36,960
group South uh headed towards Ukraine
 

1573
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,309
group South uh headed towards Ukraine
and deep into the caucuses and Hitler

1574
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:40,319
and deep into the caucuses and Hitler
 

1575
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:43,270
and deep into the caucuses and Hitler
believed that uh that that should have

1576
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
believed that uh that that should have
 

1577
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,710
believed that uh that that should have
been the main axis and in fact in

1578
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:46,720
been the main axis and in fact in
 

1579
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,309
been the main axis and in fact in
1942 the Soviets excuse me the Germans

1580
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:49,319
1942 the Soviets excuse me the Germans
 

1581
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:51,710
1942 the Soviets excuse me the Germans
go back on the offensive in

1582
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:51,720
go back on the offensive in
 

1583
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,349
go back on the offensive in
1942 this is Operation Blue and the main

1584
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
1942 this is Operation Blue and the main
 

1585
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:58,309
1942 this is Operation Blue and the main
axis in 42 is deep into the Ukraine and

1586
00:36:58,309 --> 00:36:58,319
axis in 42 is deep into the Ukraine and
 

1587
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:02,150
axis in 42 is deep into the Ukraine and
into the caucuses and that fails but one

1588
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
into the caucuses and that fails but one
 

1589
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,790
into the caucuses and that fails but one
could argue that had they done that in

1590
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:04,800
could argue that had they done that in
 

1591
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,589
could argue that had they done that in
41 had they not gone to Moscow had they

1592

41 had they not gone to Moscow had they
 

1593
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,750
41 had they not gone to Moscow had they
gone you know had they concentrated on

1594
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:09,760
gone you know had they concentrated on
 

1595
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,870
gone you know had they concentrated on
going deep into Ukraine and into the

1596
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:11,880
going deep into Ukraine and into the
 

1597
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,990
going deep into Ukraine and into the
caucuses they could have knocked the

1598
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,000
caucuses they could have knocked the
 

1599
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,829
caucuses they could have knocked the
Soviets out that way uh I'm I'm not sure

1600
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:18,839
Soviets out that way uh I'm I'm not sure
 

1601
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:21,069
Soviets out that way uh I'm I'm not sure
that in the end I believe that I I think

1602
00:37:21,069 --> 00:37:21,079
that in the end I believe that I I think
 

1603
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:23,349
that in the end I believe that I I think
in the end the Soviets would have won no

1604
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:23,359
in the end the Soviets would have won no
 

1605
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,550
in the end the Soviets would have won no
matter what but I'm not 100% sure of

matter what but I'm not 100% sure of
that so sometimes um maybe you can

1608
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:31,119
that so sometimes um maybe you can
 

1609
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,109
that so sometimes um maybe you can
educate me but sometimes you know they

1610
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
educate me but sometimes you know they
 

1611
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,430
educate me but sometimes you know they

a story of extremely Brave fighting on
 

1643
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,230
a story of extremely Brave fighting on
the Soviet side and that it's a

00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,240
the Soviet side and that it's a
 

1645
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,069
the Soviet side and that it's a
component of War too it's not just

00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,990
component of War too it's not just
structural it's not just mil strategy

1648
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
structural it's not just mil strategy
 

1649
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,069
structural it's not just mil strategy
it's also the humans involved but maybe

1650
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:31,079
it's also the humans involved but maybe
 

1651
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,790
it's also the humans involved but maybe
that's a romantic notion of war no I I

think there's a great deal of Truth in
 

1655
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,550
think there's a great deal of Truth in
that but let's just unpack it a bit in

1656
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,560
that but let's just unpack it a bit in
 

1657
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,270
that but let's just unpack it a bit in
the case of uh the Soviet Union in World

1658
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,280
the case of uh the Soviet Union in World
 

1659
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,069
the case of uh the Soviet Union in World
War II the counterargument to that um is

1660
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:47,079
War II the counterargument to that um is
 

1661
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:52,150
War II the counterargument to that um is
that in World War I the uh Russian army

1662
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,160
that in World War I the uh Russian army
 

1663
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,710
that in World War I the uh Russian army
disintegrated uh and uh if you look at

1664
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:55,720
disintegrated uh and uh if you look at
 

1665
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,950
disintegrated uh and uh if you look at
what happened when Napoleon invaded in

1666
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:58,960
what happened when Napoleon invaded in
 

1667
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,230
what happened when Napoleon invaded in
18112 and you look at what happened in

1668
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:03,240
18112 and you look at what happened in
 

1669
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,470
18112 and you look at what happened in
1917 and then you look at what happened

1670
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:05,480
1917 and then you look at what happened
 

1671
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,150
1917 and then you look at what happened
between 41 and

1672
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,160
between 41 and
 

1673
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,710
between 41 and
45 the Napoleon case looks a lot like

1674
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:10,720
45 the Napoleon case looks a lot like
 

1675
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,270
45 the Napoleon case looks a lot like
the Hitler case and it fits neatly with

1676
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:13,280
the Hitler case and it fits neatly with
 

1677
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,829
the Hitler case and it fits neatly with
your argument but World War I does not

1678
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:15,839
your argument but World War I does not
 

1679
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,470
your argument but World War I does not
fit neatly with your argument because

1680
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,589
fit neatly with your argument because

stop on the train line uh and what he

1838
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:05,599
stop on the train line uh and what he
 

1839
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,630
stop on the train line uh and what he
wanted to do was to conquer all of

00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:43,760
evidence beforehand that he was
 

1867
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,309

interested in coning conquering any of
 

1869
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,750
interested in coning conquering any of
Ukraine and there's no way that an army

1870
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
Ukraine and there's no way that an army
 

1871
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,069
Ukraine and there's no way that an army
that had

1872
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
that had
 

1873
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,630
that had
190,000 troops at the

1874
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:54,640
190,000 troops at the
 

1875
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,870
190,000 troops at the
most right could have conquered all of

1876
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:57,880
most right could have conquered all of
 

1877
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,549
most right could have conquered all of
Ukraine just impossible as I like to

1878
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:00,559
Ukraine just impossible as I like to
 

1879
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:02,430
Ukraine just impossible as I like to
emphasize when the Germans went into

1880
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:02,440
emphasize when the Germans went into
 

1881
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,309
emphasize when the Germans went into
Poland in

1882
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:04,319
Poland in
 

1883
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,630
Poland in
1939 uh and the Germans you want to

1884
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:06,640
1939 uh and the Germans you want to
 

1885
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,390
1939 uh and the Germans you want to
remember were only intent on Conquering

1886
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:09,400
remember were only intent on Conquering
 

1887
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,030
remember were only intent on Conquering
the Western half of Poland because the

1888
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:12,040
the Western half of Poland because the
 

1889
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,109
the Western half of Poland because the
Soviets uh who came in later that month

1890
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:15,119
Soviets uh who came in later that month
 

1891
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,790
Soviets uh who came in later that month
were going to conquer the eastern half

1892
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:16,800
were going to conquer the eastern half
 

1893
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,549
were going to conquer the eastern half
of Poland so the Western half of Poland

1894
00:44:20,549 --> 00:44:20,559
of Poland so the Western half of Poland
 

1895
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:23,589
of Poland so the Western half of Poland
is much smaller than Ukraine and the

1896
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
is much smaller than Ukraine and the
 

1897
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,270
is much smaller than Ukraine and the
Germans went in with 1 5 million troops

1898
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:28,280
Germans went in with 1 5 million troops
 

1899
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,950
Germans went in with 1 5 million troops
uh If U Vladimir Putin were bent on

1901
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,670
uh If U Vladimir Putin were bent on
conquering all of Ukraine he would have

1902
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:34,680
conquering all of Ukraine he would have
 

1903
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,150
conquering all of Ukraine he would have
needed at least two million troops I

1904

00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,390
of whole cloth that he is an aggressor
that he's the second coming of Adolf

that he's the second coming of Adolf
 

1973
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,349
that he's the second coming of Adolf
Hitler and that what he did in Ukraine

1974
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:09,359
Hitler and that what he did in Ukraine
 

1975
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,710
Hitler and that what he did in Ukraine
was try to to conquer all of it and he

1976
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
was try to to conquer all of it and he
 

1977
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,230
was try to to conquer all of it and he
failed but uh with a little bit of luck

1978
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:16,240
failed but uh with a little bit of luck
 

1979
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,829
failed but uh with a little bit of luck
he probably would have conquered all of

1980
00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:17,839
he probably would have conquered all of
 

1981
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,910
he probably would have conquered all of
it and he'd now be in the Baltic states

1982
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:20,920
it and he'd now be in the Baltic states
 

1983
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,430
it and he'd now be in the Baltic states
and eventually end up uh dominating all

1984
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:24,440
and eventually end up uh dominating all
 

1985
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,829
and eventually end up uh dominating all
of Eastern Europe is I I think there's

1986
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:26,839
of Eastern Europe is I I think there's
 

1987
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,750
of Eastern Europe is I I think there's
no evidence to support this so maybe

1988
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
no evidence to support this so maybe
 

1989
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,549
no evidence to support this so maybe
there's a lot of things to ask there

1990
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:31,559
there's a lot of things to ask there
 

1991
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:34,710
there's a lot of things to ask there
maybe just to linger on NATO

1992
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
maybe just to linger on NATO
 

1993
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,030

legitimate security interest no that's
 

2175
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,390
legitimate security interest no that's
not the way we operate we continue

2176
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:55,400
not the way we operate we continue
 

2177
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,390
not the way we operate we continue
contined to double down and the end

a western bulwark on Russia's border and
 

2195
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,670
a western bulwark on Russia's border and

NATO expansion was the most important
element of our strategy but the strategy

2200
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:32,839
element of our strategy but the strategy
 

2201
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,390
element of our strategy but the strategy
had two other dimensions one was EU

orange revolution in Ukraine and the
 

2209
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:48,470
orange revolution in Ukraine and the
basic goal there was to turn Ukraine

2210
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:48,480
basic goal there was to turn Ukraine

February
2022 and if you read uh what he said uh

2376
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:55,160
2022 and if you read uh what he said uh
 

2377
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,029
2022 and if you read uh what he said uh
it's quite clear that he privileged

2378
00:55:57,029 --> 00:55:57,039
it's quite clear that he privileged
 

2379
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:59,430
it's quite clear that he privileged
security or survival he was deeply

2380
00:55:59,430 --> 00:55:59,440
security or survival he was deeply
 

2381
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,789
security or survival he was deeply
concerned about the security of Russia

2382
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:02,799
concerned about the security of Russia
 

2383
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:06,029
concerned about the security of Russia
and Russia is a quite vulnerable state

2384
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:06,039
and Russia is a quite vulnerable state
 

2385
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:07,990
and Russia is a quite vulnerable state
in a lot of ways especially if you think

2386
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
in a lot of ways especially if you think
 

2387
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,630
in a lot of ways especially if you think
back to what it looked like in the 1990s

2388
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
back to what it looked like in the 1990s
 

2389
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,789
back to what it looked like in the 1990s
you know better than I do uh it was in

2390
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:13,799
you know better than I do uh it was in
 

2391
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:16,789
you know better than I do uh it was in
terrible shape uh the Chinese talk about

2392
00:56:16,789 --> 00:56:16,799
terrible shape uh the Chinese talk about
 

2393
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,309
terrible shape uh the Chinese talk about
the century of national humiliation one

2394
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:19,319
the century of national humiliation one
 

2395
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:20,910
the century of national humiliation one
could argue that for the Russians that

2396
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:20,920
could argue that for the Russians that
 

2397
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,270
could argue that for the Russians that
was the decade of national

2398
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:23,280
was the decade of national
 

2399
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,630
was the decade of national
humiliation and uh and it took Putin I

2400
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:26,640
humiliation and uh and it took Putin I
 

2401
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,549
humiliation and uh and it took Putin I
think quite a bit of time to bring the

2402
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:28,559
think quite a bit of time to bring the
 

2403
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,990
think quite a bit of time to bring the
Russians back from the dead I think he

2404
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:31,000
Russians back from the dead I think he
 

2405
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,789
Russians back from the dead I think he
eventually succeeded but uh it took a

2406
00:56:33,789 --> 00:56:33,799
eventually succeeded but uh it took a
 

2407
00:56:33,799 --> 00:56:36,470
eventually succeeded but uh it took a
considerable amount of time and I think

2408
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
considerable amount of time and I think
 

2409
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,109
considerable amount of time and I think
he understood that he was not playing a

2410
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
he understood that he was not playing a
 

2411
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,910
he understood that he was not playing a
particularly strong hand he was playing

2412
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:40,920
particularly strong hand he was playing
 

2413
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,190
particularly strong hand he was playing
something of a weak hand and he had to

2414
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
something of a weak hand and he had to
 

2415
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,950
something of a weak hand and he had to
be very careful very cautious and I

2416
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:45,960
be very careful very cautious and I
 

2417
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:49,510
be very careful very cautious and I
think he was uh and I think that's very

2418
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:49,520
think he was uh and I think that's very
 

2419
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,630
think he was uh and I think that's very
different than the United States the

2420
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:51,640
different than the United States the
 

2421
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,990
different than the United States the
United States was the unipole it was the

2422
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
United States was the unipole it was the
 

2423
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,750
United States was the unipole it was the
most powerful state in the history of

00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:55,760
most powerful state in the history of
 

2425

most powerful state in the history of
the world most powerful State relative

2426
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:57,839
the world most powerful State relative
 

2427
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:00,990
the world most powerful State relative
to all its possible competitors from you

2428
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:01,000
to all its possible competitors from you
 

2429
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,710
to all its possible competitors from you
know roughly 1989 certainly after

2430
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
know roughly 1989 certainly after
 

2431
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,510
know roughly 1989 certainly after
December 1991 when the Soviet Union fell

2432
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:07,520
December 1991 when the Soviet Union fell
 

2433
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,230
December 1991 when the Soviet Union fell
apart up until I would argue about 2017

2434
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:11,240
apart up until I would argue about 2017
 

2435
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,950
apart up until I would argue about 2017
we were incredibly powerful and even

2436
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
we were incredibly powerful and even
 

2437
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,829
we were incredibly powerful and even
after

2438
00:57:13,829 --> 00:57:13,839
after
 

2439
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,670
after
2017 up to today the United States

2440
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:16,680
2017 up to today the United States
 

2441
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,309
2017 up to today the United States
Remains the most powerful state in the

2442
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:18,319
Remains the most powerful state in the
 

2443
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:21,510
Remains the most powerful state in the
system and because of our geographical

2444
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:21,520
system and because of our geographical
 

2445
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,910
system and because of our geographical
location uh we are in a uh

2446
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:25,920
location uh we are in a uh
 

2447
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,630
location uh we are in a uh
terrific uh situation to survive in any

2448
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:29,640
terrific uh situation to survive in any
 

2449
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,510
terrific uh situation to survive in any
great power competition so uh you have a

2450
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:33,520
great power competition so uh you have a
 

2451
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,390
great power competition so uh you have a
situation involving the United States

2452
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:36,400
situation involving the United States
 

2453
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,430
situation involving the United States
that's different than the situation

2454
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:38,440
that's different than the situation
 

2455
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,910
that's different than the situation
involving Russia they're they're just

2456
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:40,920
involving Russia they're they're just
 

2457
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,230
involving Russia they're they're just
much more vulnerable uh than we are and

2458
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:44,240
much more vulnerable uh than we are and
 

2459
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,990
much more vulnerable uh than we are and
and therefore I think Putin tends to be

2460
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,000
and therefore I think Putin tends to be
 

2461
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,069
and therefore I think Putin tends to be
more sensitive about security uh than

2462
00:57:49,069 --> 00:57:49,079
more sensitive about security uh than
 

2463
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:51,789
more sensitive about security uh than
any American president in recent Times

2464
00:57:51,789 --> 00:57:51,799
any American president in recent Times
 

2465
00:57:51,799 --> 00:57:54,109
any American president in recent Times
Europe on one side China on the other

2466
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:54,119
Europe on one side China on the other
 

2467
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:56,910
Europe on one side China on the other
side it's a complicated situation yeah

2468
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:56,920
side it's a complicated situation yeah
 

2469
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,870
side it's a complicated situation yeah
and we talked before about 1812 when

2470
00:57:59,870 --> 00:57:59,880
and we talked before about 1812 when
 

2471
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,789
and we talked before about 1812 when
Napoleon invaded and Moscow got burned

2472
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:02,799
Napoleon invaded and Moscow got burned
 

2473
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:05,150
Napoleon invaded and Moscow got burned
to the ground we talked about World War

2474
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:05,160
to the ground we talked about World War
 

2475
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,589
to the ground we talked about World War
I where the Russians were actually

2476
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
I where the Russians were actually
 

2477
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,910
I where the Russians were actually
defeated uh and surrendered uh and then

2478
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:10,920
defeated uh and surrendered uh and then
 

2479
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,549
defeated uh and surrendered uh and then
we talked about 1941 to 1945 where

2480
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,559
we talked about 1941 to 1945 where
 

2481
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:18,349
we talked about 1941 to 1945 where
although thankfully uh the Soviets

2482
00:58:18,349 --> 00:58:18,359
although thankfully uh the Soviets
 

2483
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:22,829
although thankfully uh the Soviets
prevailed uh it was uh it was a close

2484
00:58:22,829 --> 00:58:22,839
prevailed uh it was uh it was a close
 

2485
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:26,190
prevailed uh it was uh it was a close
call and I mean the casualties the

2486
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:26,200
call and I mean the casualties the
 

2487
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,549
call and I mean the casualties the
destruction that the Soviet

2488
00:58:28,549 --> 00:58:28,559
destruction that the Soviet
 

2489
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:31,230
destruction that the Soviet
Union uh had inflicted on it by the

2490
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:31,240
Union uh had inflicted on it by the
 

2491
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:34,150
Union uh had inflicted on it by the
Germans is just almost almost hard to

2492
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,160
Germans is just almost almost hard to
 

2493
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,750
Germans is just almost almost hard to
believe

2494
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:35,760
believe
 

2495
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,349
believe
just uh so they are sensitive you can

2496
00:58:40,349 --> 00:58:40,359
just uh so they are sensitive you can
 

2497
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:42,150
just uh so they are sensitive you can
understand full well or at least you

2498
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:42,160
understand full well or at least you
 

2499
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,150
understand full well or at least you
should be able to understand full well

2500
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:44,160
should be able to understand full well
 

2501
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,910
should be able to understand full well
why the idea of bringing Ukraine up to

2502
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:46,920
why the idea of bringing Ukraine up to
 

2503
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,630
why the idea of bringing Ukraine up to
their border really spooked them uh I

2504
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:49,640
their border really spooked them uh I
 

2505
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,390
their border really spooked them uh I
don't understand why more Americans

2506
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:51,400
don't understand why more Americans
 

2507
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,870
don't understand why more Americans
don't understand that it just it it

2508
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:53,880
don't understand that it just it it
 

2509
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,630
don't understand that it just it it
befuddles me

2510
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:55,640
befuddles me
 

2511
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,950
befuddles me
I think it has to do with the fact that

2512
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:56,960
I think it has to do with the fact that
 

2513
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,829
I think it has to do with the fact that
Americans are not very good in putting

2514
00:58:58,829 --> 00:58:58,839
Americans are not very good in putting
 

2515
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:00,190
Americans are not very good in putting
themselves in the shoes of other

2516
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:00,200
themselves in the shoes of other
 

2517
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,190
themselves in the shoes of other
countries uh and uh you really if if

2518
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:04,200
countries uh and uh you really if if
 

2519
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,270
countries uh and uh you really if if
you're going to be a first class

2520
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:05,280
you're going to be a first class
 

2521
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,029
you're going to be a first class
strategist in international politics you

2522
00:59:07,029 --> 00:59:07,039
strategist in international politics you
 

2523
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:08,870
strategist in international politics you
have to be able to do that you have to

2524
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:08,880
have to be able to do that you have to
 

2525
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,470
have to be able to do that you have to
put yourself in the shoes of the other

2526
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:10,480
put yourself in the shoes of the other
 

2527

response was to that and uh Mike said
 

2593
01:00:45,799 --> 01:00:50,190

01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,270
that Putin didn't believe it uh and uh
but Mike believed it he should believe

2596
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:52,280
but Mike believed it he should believe
 

2597
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,190
but Mike believed it he should believe
it and that we could move NATO Eastward

2598
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:56,200
it and that we could move NATO Eastward
 

2599
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,349
it and that we could move NATO Eastward
to include Ukraine and in the end we get

away with it because we are a benign
 

2603
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,069

2623
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,470
dead so like it doesn't make sense from
a geop political perspective on the

2624
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:32,480
a geop political perspective on the

pushed from your perspective there are
 

2633
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,069
pushed from your perspective there are
two reasons one is first of all we

2634
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:50,079
two reasons one is first of all we
 

2635
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,309
two reasons one is first of all we
thought it was a wonderful thing uh to

2636
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:53,319
thought it was a wonderful thing uh to
 

2637
01:01:53,319 --> 01:01:55,190
thought it was a wonderful thing uh to
bring more and more countri Ries into

2638
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
bring more and more countri Ries into
 

2639
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,390
bring more and more countri Ries into
NATO we thought that it facilitated

2640
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:57,400
NATO we thought that it facilitated
 

2641
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,309
NATO we thought that it facilitated
peace and prosperity it was ultimately

2642
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
peace and prosperity it was ultimately
 

2643
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:06,029
peace and prosperity it was ultimately
all for the good um and uh we also

2644
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:06,039
all for the good um and uh we also
 

2645
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:09,390
all for the good um and uh we also
thought that uh uh countries like

2646
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:09,400
thought that uh uh countries like
 

2647
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,990
thought that uh uh countries like
Ukraine had a right to join NATO these

2648
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:13,000
Ukraine had a right to join NATO these
 

2649
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,910
Ukraine had a right to join NATO these
are sovereign countries that can decide

2650
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:14,920
are sovereign countries that can decide
 

2651
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,990
are sovereign countries that can decide
for themselves and the Russians have no

2652
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:17,000
for themselves and the Russians have no
 

2653
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,069
for themselves and the Russians have no
say in what Ukraine wants to do and then

2654
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:22,079
say in what Ukraine wants to do and then
 

2655
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,549
say in what Ukraine wants to do and then
finally and uh this is a point I

2656
01:02:24,549 --> 01:02:24,559
finally and uh this is a point I
 

2657
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,710
finally and uh this is a point I
emphasized before we were very powerful

2658
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:26,720
emphasized before we were very powerful
 

2659
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:27,870
emphasized before we were very powerful
and we thought we could shove it down

2660
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:27,880
and we thought we could shove it down
 

2661
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,670
and we thought we could shove it down
their throat so so it's a combination of

2662
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:31,680
their throat so so it's a combination of
 

2663
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,950
their throat so so it's a combination of
those factors that led us to pursue what

2664
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
those factors that led us to pursue what
 

2665
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,589
those factors that led us to pursue what
I think was ultimately uh a foolish

2666
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:38,599
I think was ultimately uh a foolish
 

2667
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:42,510
I think was ultimately uh a foolish
policy we've talked about how Wars get

some point the shooting stops you have a
ceasefire and then you have a frozen

2779
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,589
flourishing I think the answer is no
even with uh United States involved

2780
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:26,599
even with uh United States involved
 

2781

even with uh United States involved
three people in the room well I think

2782
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:28,760
three people in the room well I think
 

2783
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,029
three people in the room well I think
you if the United States is involved the

2784
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:31,039
you if the United States is involved the
 

2785
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:33,269
you if the United States is involved the
answer is definitely no you have to get

2786
01:05:33,269 --> 01:05:33,279

2787
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:37,190
answer is definitely no you have to get
the Americans out uh and then I I think

2788
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,200
the Americans out uh and then I I think
 

2789
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,870
the Americans out uh and then I I think

01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:35,560
Putin and Russia to annexing the four
 

2995
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:37,870
Putin and Russia to annexing the four
oblas that they've now annexed plus

2996
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:37,880
oblas that they've now annexed plus
 

2997
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,189
oblas that they've now annexed plus
Crimea that's the best I think you can

2998
01:10:40,189 --> 01:10:40,199
Crimea that's the best I think you can
 

2999
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:42,110
Crimea that's the best I think you can
hope for but the point is you have to

3000
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:42,120
hope for but the point is you have to
 

3001
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,830
hope for but the point is you have to
get the ukrainians to accept that you

3002
01:10:44,830 --> 01:10:44,840
get the ukrainians to accept that you
 

3003
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,189
get the ukrainians to accept that you
have to get the ukrainians to accept

3004
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:47,199
have to get the ukrainians to accept
 

3005
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,870
have to get the ukrainians to accept
becoming a truly neutral State and

3006
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:49,880
becoming a truly neutral State and
 

3007
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,270
becoming a truly neutral State and
conceding that the Russians keep a big

3008
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:52,280
conceding that the Russians keep a big
 

3009
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,990
conceding that the Russians keep a big
chunk of territory it's about 23% of

3010
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:55,000
chunk of territory it's about 23% of
 

3011
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,229
chunk of territory it's about 23% of
Ukrainian territory that they've

3012
01:10:57,229 --> 01:10:57,239
Ukrainian territory that they've
 

3013
01:10:57,239 --> 01:11:00,910
Ukrainian territory that they've
annexed and I find it hard to imagine

3014
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:00,920
annexed and I find it hard to imagine
 

3015
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,709
annexed and I find it hard to imagine
any Ukrainian leader agree to that well

3016
01:11:03,709 --> 01:11:03,719
any Ukrainian leader agree to that well
 

3017
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:05,750
any Ukrainian leader agree to that well
there there there could be more Nuance

3018
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:05,760
there there there could be more Nuance
 

3019
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,990
there there there could be more Nuance
things like no military involvement

3020
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:09,000
things like no military involvement
 

3021
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,070
things like no military involvement
between the United States in Ukraine but

3022
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:11,080
between the United States in Ukraine but
 

3023
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:13,270
between the United States in Ukraine but
economic involvement sort of uh

3024
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:13,280
economic involvement sort of uh
 

3025
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,910
economic involvement sort of uh
financial support So normalizing

3026
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:16,920
financial support So normalizing
 

3027
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,390
financial support So normalizing
economic relationships with Ukraine with

3028
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:19,400
economic relationships with Ukraine with
 

3029
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,709
economic relationships with Ukraine with
Russia I I think you could probably get

3030
01:11:21,709 --> 01:11:21,719
Russia I I think you could probably get
 

3031
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:23,790
Russia I I think you could probably get
away with that I I think that the the

3032
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:23,800
away with that I I think that the the
 

3033
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,110
away with that I I think that the the
tricky question there that you would

3034
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,120
tricky question there that you would
 

3035
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:27,430
tricky question there that you would
have to answer is what about EU

3036
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:27,440
have to answer is what about EU
 

3037
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:31,149
have to answer is what about EU
expansion right and I think EU expansion

3038
01:11:31,149 --> 01:11:31,159
expansion right and I think EU expansion
 

3039
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:33,709
expansion right and I think EU expansion
is probably a no no for the Russians

3040
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:33,719
is probably a no no for the Russians
 

3041
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:35,830
is probably a no no for the Russians
because most people don't recognize this

3042
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:35,840
because most people don't recognize this
 

3043
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,149
because most people don't recognize this
but there is a military Dimension built

3044
01:11:39,149 --> 01:11:39,159
but there is a military Dimension built
 

3045
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:43,149
but there is a military Dimension built
into EU expansion it's not purely an

3046
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:43,159
into EU expansion it's not purely an
 

3047
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:47,430
into EU expansion it's not purely an
economic uh Alliance uh or relationship

3048
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
economic uh Alliance uh or relationship
 

3049
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,629
economic uh Alliance uh or relationship
or institution whatever word you want to

3050
01:11:49,629 --> 01:11:49,639
or institution whatever word you want to
 

3051
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:52,669
or institution whatever word you want to
use there's a military Dimension to that

3052
01:11:52,669 --> 01:11:52,679
use there's a military Dimension to that
 

3053
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:56,990
use there's a military Dimension to that
and in the runup to the War uh actually

3054
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:57,000
and in the runup to the War uh actually
 

3055
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,629
and in the runup to the War uh actually
in the runup to the 2014 crisis when it

3056
01:11:59,629 --> 01:11:59,639
in the runup to the 2014 crisis when it
 

3057
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:03,510
in the runup to the 2014 crisis when it
first broke out uh the Russians made it

3058
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:03,520
first broke out uh the Russians made it
 

3059
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,550
first broke out uh the Russians made it
clear they saw EU expansion as a

3060
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:06,560
clear they saw EU expansion as a
 

3061
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,110
clear they saw EU expansion as a
stalking horse for NATO expansion so EU

3062
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:11,120
stalking horse for NATO expansion so EU
 

3063
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,510
stalking horse for NATO expansion so EU
expansion is tricky but I I think your

3064
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:14,520
expansion is tricky but I I think your
 

3065
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:19,189
expansion is tricky but I I think your
point of close economic relations

3066
01:12:19,189 --> 01:12:19,199
point of close economic relations
 

3067
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,350
point of close economic relations
between uh or healthy economic relations

3068
01:12:22,350 --> 01:12:22,360
between uh or healthy economic relations
 

3069
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:25,149
between uh or healthy economic relations
to use a better term between Ukraine and

3070
01:12:25,149 --> 01:12:25,159
to use a better term between Ukraine and
 

3071
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:27,750
to use a better term between Ukraine and
the West is possible I I I think the

3072
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:27,760
the West is possible I I I think the
 

3073
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,270
the West is possible I I I think the
Russians have a vested interest in if if

3074
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:30,280
Russians have a vested interest in if if
 

3075
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,550
Russians have a vested interest in if if
it's a neutral Ukraine they have a

3076
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:32,560
it's a neutral Ukraine they have a
 

3077
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,669
it's a neutral Ukraine they have a
vested interest in that Ukraine

3078
01:12:34,669 --> 01:12:34,679
vested interest in that Ukraine
 

3079
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:37,189
vested interest in that Ukraine
flourishing but that then brings us back

3080
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
flourishing but that then brings us back
 

3081
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,189
flourishing but that then brings us back
to the territorial issue all right well

3082
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:40,199
to the territorial issue all right well
 

3083
01:12:40,199 --> 01:12:43,629
to the territorial issue all right well
so do you believe it's possible for

3084
01:12:43,629 --> 01:12:43,639
so do you believe it's possible for
 

3085
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:45,950
so do you believe it's possible for
individual human relations to counteract

3086
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:45,960
individual human relations to counteract
 

3087
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,149
individual human relations to counteract
the structural forces that you talk

3088
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
the structural forces that you talk
 

3089
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,550
the structural forces that you talk
about so meaning the

3090
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:50,560
about so meaning the
 

3091
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,470
about so meaning the
leaders being able to pick up the phone

3092
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:53,480
leaders being able to pick up the phone
 

3093
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,470
leaders being able to pick up the phone
and make agreements that are good for

3094
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:55,480
and make agreements that are good for
 

3095
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,470
and make agreements that are good for
Humanity as a whole and for their

3096
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:57,480
Humanity as a whole and for their
 

3097
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,149
Humanity as a whole and for their
individual nations in the long term I

3098
01:12:59,149 --> 01:12:59,159
individual nations in the long term I
 

3099
01:12:59,159 --> 01:13:01,709
individual nations in the long term I
think leadership matters here

3100
01:13:01,709 --> 01:13:01,719
think leadership matters here
 

3101
01:13:01,719 --> 01:13:05,629
think leadership matters here
uh I mean one of the real problems here

3102
01:13:05,629 --> 01:13:05,639
uh I mean one of the real problems here
 

3103
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:08,790
uh I mean one of the real problems here
is that there's no trust and uh on the

3104
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:08,800
is that there's no trust and uh on the
 

3105
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,510
is that there's no trust and uh on the
Russian side and that has to do with the

3106
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
Russian side and that has to do with the
 

3107
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,669
Russian side and that has to do with the
Minsk agreements um the uh uh the Minsk

3108
01:13:16,669 --> 01:13:16,679
Minsk agreements um the uh uh the Minsk
 

3109
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:20,070
Minsk agreements um the uh uh the Minsk
agreements uh which were designed to

3110
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:20,080
agreements uh which were designed to
 

3111
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,149
agreements uh which were designed to
shut down the Civil

3112
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:22,159
shut down the Civil
 

3113
01:13:22,159 --> 01:13:27,070
shut down the Civil
War uh in eastern Ukraine in the donbass

3114
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:27,080
War uh in eastern Ukraine in the donbass
 

3115
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,830
War uh in eastern Ukraine in the donbass
um really mattered to the Russians and

3116
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:29,840
um really mattered to the Russians and
 

3117
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,950
um really mattered to the Russians and
there were four players involved in the

3118
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:32,960
there were four players involved in the
 

3119

01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,390
the Russians were having all that
trouble with progan and the Vagner group

3308
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:10,400
trouble with progan and the Vagner group
 

3309
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:14,030
trouble with progan and the Vagner group
that Putin was vulnerable and was likely

3310
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:14,040
that Putin was vulnerable and was likely
 

3311
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,110
that Putin was vulnerable and was likely
to be

3312
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
to be
 

3313
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:18,870
to be
overthrown and what would happen is uh a

3314
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:18,880
overthrown and what would happen is uh a
 

3315
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,430
overthrown and what would happen is uh a
peaceloving leader would replace Putin

3316
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:23,440
peaceloving leader would replace Putin
 

3317
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,629
peaceloving leader would replace Putin
uh I made two points at the time and I

3318
01:18:25,629 --> 01:18:25,639
uh I made two points at the time and I
 

3319
01:18:25,639 --> 01:18:28,590
uh I made two points at the time and I
would make those same two points now

3320
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:28,600
would make those same two points now
 

3321
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:31,149
would make those same two points now
number one he's not

3322
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:31,159
number one he's not
 

3323
01:18:31,159 --> 01:18:34,709
number one he's not
likely to be overthrown he was not

3324
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:34,719
likely to be overthrown he was not
 

3325
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,070
likely to be overthrown he was not
likely then to be

3326
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:37,080
likely then to be
 

3327
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,229
likely then to be
overthrown uh and I think you know as

3328
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:40,239
overthrown uh and I think you know as
 

3329
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,750
overthrown uh and I think you know as
long as his health holds up I think he

3330
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:42,760
long as his health holds up I think he
 

3331
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,350
long as his health holds up I think he
will remain in power my second point is

3332
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:46,360
will remain in power my second point is
 

3333
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:49,470
will remain in power my second point is
if he doesn't remain in power and he's

3334
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:49,480
if he doesn't remain in power and he's
 

3335
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,990
if he doesn't remain in power and he's
replaced I would bet a lot of money that

3336
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:52,000
replaced I would bet a lot of money that
 

3337
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,189
replaced I would bet a lot of money that
his replacement will be more hawkish and

3338
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
his replacement will be more hawkish and
 

3339
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:58,950
his replacement will be more hawkish and
more Hardline than Putin is uh I

3340
01:18:58,950 --> 01:18:58,960
more Hardline than Putin is uh I
 

3341
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,390
more Hardline than Putin is uh I
actually think one could argue that

3342
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:01,400
actually think one could argue that
 

3343
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,110
actually think one could argue that
Putin was too trusting of the West

3344
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:04,120
Putin was too trusting of the West
 

3345
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,709
Putin was too trusting of the West
before the war

3346
01:19:05,709 --> 01:19:05,719
before the war
 

3347
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:08,709
before the war
started uh and number two I think one

3348
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
started uh and number two I think one
 

3349
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,910
started uh and number two I think one
could argue that he has not waged the

3350
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:11,920
could argue that he has not waged the
 

3351
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,590
could argue that he has not waged the
war against Ukraine as vigorously as one

3352
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:16,600
war against Ukraine as vigorously as one
 

3353
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:20,350
war against Ukraine as vigorously as one
might have expected uh he was slow to

3354
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:20,360
might have expected uh he was slow to
 

3355
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,830
might have expected uh he was slow to
mobilize the nation for war

3356
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:23,840
mobilize the nation for war
 

3357
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:29,310
mobilize the nation for war
uh and he has pursued a limited war in

3358
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:29,320
uh and he has pursued a limited war in
 

3359
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,189
uh and he has pursued a limited war in
all sorts of ways uh the Israelis for

3360
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:32,199
all sorts of ways uh the Israelis for
 

3361
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:35,590
all sorts of ways uh the Israelis for
example have killed more civilians in

3362
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:35,600
example have killed more civilians in
 

3363
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,550
example have killed more civilians in
Gaza in one month than the Russians have

3364
01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:38,560
Gaza in one month than the Russians have
 

3365
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,830
Gaza in one month than the Russians have
killed over 18 months in Ukraine the

3366
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:42,840
killed over 18 months in Ukraine the
 

3367
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:46,189
killed over 18 months in Ukraine the
idea that Vladimir Putin is waging a

3368
01:19:46,189 --> 01:19:46,199
idea that Vladimir Putin is waging a
 

3369
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,870
idea that Vladimir Putin is waging a
punishment campaign and killing on

3370
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:48,880
punishment campaign and killing on
 

3371
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,950
punishment campaign and killing on
purpose large numbers of civilians is

3372
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:50,960
purpose large numbers of civilians is
 

3373
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,950
purpose large numbers of civilians is
simply not true uh all this is to say

3374
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:54,960
simply not true uh all this is to say
 

3375
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,070
simply not true uh all this is to say
that I would imagine that if Putin

3376
01:19:58,070 --> 01:19:58,080
that I would imagine that if Putin
 

3377
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,830
that I would imagine that if Putin
leaves office and someone else comes in

3378
01:20:00,830 --> 01:20:00,840
leaves office and someone else comes in
 

3379
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,709
leaves office and someone else comes in
to replace him that someone else will be

3380
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:03,719
to replace him that someone else will be
 

3381
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:06,950
to replace him that someone else will be
at least if not more Hardline than him

3382
01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:06,960
at least if not more Hardline than him
 

3383
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,629
at least if not more Hardline than him
in terms of waging the war and certainly

3384
01:20:09,629 --> 01:20:09,639
in terms of waging the war and certainly
 

3385
01:20:09,639 --> 01:20:14,070
in terms of waging the war and certainly
will not trust the West any more than he

3386
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:14,080
will not trust the West any more than he
 

3387

good ideas to explore what are good

3400
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:36,520
good ideas to explore what are good
 

3401
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:39,910
good ideas to explore what are good
questions to ask what are good things to

3402
01:20:39,910 --> 01:20:39,920
questions to ask what are good things to
 

3403
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,229
questions to ask what are good things to
say on or off the mic once again that

3404
01:20:43,229 --> 01:20:43,239
say on or off the mic once again that
 

3405
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:44,149
say on or off the mic once again that
could

3406
01:20:44,149 --> 01:20:44,159
could
 

3407
01:20:44,159 --> 01:20:47,189
could
potentially even slightly less than the

3408
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,199
potentially even slightly less than the
 

3409
01:20:47,199 --> 01:20:49,709
potentially even slightly less than the
amount of suffering in the world caused

3410
01:20:49,709 --> 01:20:49,719
amount of suffering in the world caused
 

3411
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:51,990
amount of suffering in the world caused
by this war oh I think if you get an

3412
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:52,000
by this war oh I think if you get an
 

3413
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,229
by this war oh I think if you get an
interview with Vladimir Putin there just

3414
01:20:55,229 --> 01:20:55,239
interview with Vladimir Putin there just
 

3415
01:20:55,239 --> 01:20:57,910
interview with Vladimir Putin there just
all sorts of questions you could ask him

3416
01:20:57,910 --> 01:20:57,920
all sorts of questions you could ask him
 

3417
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,229
all sorts of questions you could ask him
and my sense is that Putin is a straight

3418
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:00,239
and my sense is that Putin is a straight
 

3419
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:03,189
and my sense is that Putin is a straight
shooter uh he's also very knowledgeable

3420
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:03,199
shooter uh he's also very knowledgeable
 

3421
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,270
shooter uh he's also very knowledgeable
about history and he has simple theories

3422
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:05,280
about history and he has simple theories
 

3423
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,750
about history and he has simple theories
in his head about how the world works

3424
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
in his head about how the world works
 

3425
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,030
in his head about how the world works
and I think he would level with you and

3426
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:10,040
and I think he would level with you and
 

3427
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,550
and I think he would level with you and
all you would have to do is just you

3428
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:11,560
all you would have to do is just you
 

3429
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,990
all you would have to do is just you
know figure out what all the right

3430
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:13,000
know figure out what all the right
 

3431
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,430
know figure out what all the right
questions are and that would not be hard

3432
01:21:15,430 --> 01:21:15,440
questions are and that would not be hard
 

3433
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,990
questions are and that would not be hard
to do right uh you know you could ask

3434
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:19,000
to do right uh you know you could ask
 

3435
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,709
to do right uh you know you could ask
him why was he so foolish this is for a

3436
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:22,719
him why was he so foolish this is for a

clear that he was so unhappy with the

to create some sort of security
architecture in Europe uh that resulted

3516
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:15,280
architecture in Europe uh that resulted
 

3517
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,510
architecture in Europe uh that resulted
in you Vladimir Putin having good

3518

about that uh so there there are just
 

3527
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:32,950
about that uh so there there are just
plenty of questions you could ask

3528

3537
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,310
hope cuz hope is uh the leap of trust
that we've talked about I think is

3538
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:47,320
that we've talked about I think is
 

3539
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:50,149
that we've talked about I think is
necessary for deescalation and for peace

3540
01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
necessary for deescalation and for peace
 

3541
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,750
necessary for deescalation and for peace
well you realize I have from the

3542
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:52,760
well you realize I have from the
 

3543
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,470
well you realize I have from the
beginning argued for different policies

3544
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:56,480
beginning argued for different policies
 

3545
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,310
beginning argued for different policies
that were all designed to prevent this

3546
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
that were all designed to prevent this
 

3547
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,790
that were all designed to prevent this
war from ever happening yes I don't know

3548
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:00,800
war from ever happening yes I don't know
 

3549
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,430
war from ever happening yes I don't know
if you know this but in 1993 I argued

3550
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:03,440
if you know this but in 1993 I argued
 

3551
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:05,430
if you know this but in 1993 I argued
that Ukraine should keep its nuclear

3552
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:05,440
that Ukraine should keep its nuclear
 

3553
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,910
that Ukraine should keep its nuclear
weapons I was probably the only person

3554
01:24:07,910 --> 01:24:07,920
weapons I was probably the only person
 

3555
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,709
weapons I was probably the only person
in the west who made that argument and

3556
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:10,719
in the west who made that argument and
 

3557
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:14,229
in the west who made that argument and
my argument in 1993 this is in foreign

3558
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
my argument in 1993 this is in foreign
 

3559
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:17,470
my argument in 1993 this is in foreign
affairs was that there may come the day

3560
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:17,480
affairs was that there may come the day
 

3561
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,990
affairs was that there may come the day
when Russia thinks about invading

3562
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
when Russia thinks about invading
 

3563
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,629
when Russia thinks about invading
Ukraine and should that day come it

3564
01:24:22,629 --> 01:24:22,639
Ukraine and should that day come it
 

3565
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:25,550
Ukraine and should that day come it
would be very helpful for preventing War

3566
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:25,560
would be very helpful for preventing War
 

3567
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,669
would be very helpful for preventing War
if Ukraine had nuclear weapons so

3568
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
if Ukraine had nuclear weapons so
 

3569
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,270
if Ukraine had nuclear weapons so
military might is essential for

01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
military might is essential for
 

3571
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,590

well if you're interested in deterring

3574
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:35,280
well if you're interested in deterring
 

3575
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,110
well if you're interested in deterring
an adversary if I'm worried about you

3576
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,120
an adversary if I'm worried about you
 

3577
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,950
an adversary if I'm worried about you
coming after me the best way to deter

3578
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:39,960
coming after me the best way to deter
 

3579
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:42,510
coming after me the best way to deter
you is to have military might and if

3580
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:42,520
you is to have military might and if
 

3581
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:45,149
you is to have military might and if
you're Russia and I'm Ukraine I'm far

3582
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:45,159
you're Russia and I'm Ukraine I'm far
 

3583
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:48,430
you're Russia and I'm Ukraine I'm far
weaker than you yeah right and having a

3584
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:48,440
weaker than you yeah right and having a
 

3585
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,709
weaker than you yeah right and having a
nuclear deterrent would be very

3586
01:24:50,709 --> 01:24:50,719
nuclear deterrent would be very
 

3587
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,510
nuclear deterrent would be very
effective at convincing you not to

3588
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:53,520
effective at convincing you not to
 

3589
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,790
effective at convincing you not to
attack me because if you attack me

3590
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:55,800
attack me because if you attack me
 

3591
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,669
attack me because if you attack me
you're threatening my survival and

3592
01:24:57,669 --> 01:24:57,679
you're threatening my survival and
 

3593
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:01,070
you're threatening my survival and
that's the one circumstance where it is

3594
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:01,080
that's the one circumstance where it is
 

3595
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,669
that's the one circumstance where it is
likely that I would use nuclear weapons

3596
01:25:03,669 --> 01:25:03,679
likely that I would use nuclear weapons
 

3597
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:05,750
likely that I would use nuclear weapons
to defend myself and given the

3598
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:05,760
to defend myself and given the
 

3599
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,750
to defend myself and given the
consequences of nuclear use you would be

3600
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:08,760
consequences of nuclear use you would be
 

3601
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:12,229
consequences of nuclear use you would be
reluctant in the extreme to attack me so

3602
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:12,239
reluctant in the extreme to attack me so
 

3603
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,030
reluctant in the extreme to attack me so
that's why I argued in 93 that if

3604
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:15,040
that's why I argued in 93 that if
 

3605
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,629
that's why I argued in 93 that if
Ukraine kept its nuclear weapons that

3606
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:17,639
Ukraine kept its nuclear weapons that
 

3607
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:20,229
Ukraine kept its nuclear weapons that
made War down the road much less likely

3608
01:25:20,229 --> 01:25:20,239
made War down the road much less likely
 

3609
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,030
made War down the road much less likely
and I believe I was correct and in fact

3610
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:22,040
and I believe I was correct and in fact
 

3611
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,270
and I believe I was correct and in fact

01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
a mistake doing that furthermore I
 

3621
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,750
a mistake doing that furthermore I
argued in

3622
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:38,760
argued in
 

3623
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:41,790
argued in
2014 that it made eminently good sense

3624
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:41,800
2014 that it made eminently good sense
 

3625
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,590
2014 that it made eminently good sense
not to continue to push to bring Ukraine

3626
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:44,600
not to continue to push to bring Ukraine
 

3627
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:47,629
not to continue to push to bring Ukraine
into NATO because the end result is that

3628
01:25:47,629 --> 01:25:47,639
into NATO because the end result is that
 

3629
01:25:47,639 --> 01:25:49,910
into NATO because the end result is that
Ukraine would be destroyed and Ukraine

3630
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:49,920
Ukraine would be destroyed and Ukraine
 

3631
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,669
Ukraine would be destroyed and Ukraine
is being destroyed so I was deep deeply

3632
01:25:52,669 --> 01:25:52,679
is being destroyed so I was deep deeply
 

3633
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:55,229
is being destroyed so I was deep deeply
interested at time in making sure that

01:25:55,229 --> 01:25:55,239
interested at time in making sure that
 

3635
01:25:55,239 --> 01:25:56,990
interested at time in making sure that
that didn't happen for the good of the

3636

that didn't happen for the good of the
 

3637
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,590
that didn't happen for the good of the
ukrainians not to mention because

01:25:59,590 --> 01:25:59,600
ukrainians not to mention because
 

3639
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,950
ukrainians not to mention because
stability in Europe is a net positive

3640
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:02,960
stability in Europe is a net positive
 

3641
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,310
stability in Europe is a net positive
for almost everybody involved but people

3642

for almost everybody involved but people
 

3643
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,750
for almost everybody involved but people
did not listen to me then either how do

01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:08,760
did not listen to me then either how do
 

3645
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,669

nuclear weapons change the calculus of

assured destruction I mean it's not just

01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:15,920
assured destruction I mean it's not just
 

3651
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,629

use it's an interesting question how you
 

3683
01:26:56,679 --> 01:26:58,910
use it's an interesting question how you
think about nuclear use in a mad world I

think about nuclear use in a mad world I
 

3685
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,350
think about nuclear use in a mad world I
mean your point that we're in a mad

nuclear weapons would be used but the

nuclear weapons would be used but the

way you use nuclear weapons in that
 

3705
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,470
way you use nuclear weapons in that
world is you use them uh for

world is you use them uh for
 

3707
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:30,109

would uh explode a handful more of

3780
01:29:15,109 --> 01:29:15,119
would uh explode a handful more of
 

3781
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:18,109
would uh explode a handful more of
nuclear weapons all for the purposes of

3782
01:29:18,109 --> 01:29:18,119
nuclear weapons all for the purposes of
 

3783
01:29:18,119 --> 01:29:21,709
nuclear weapons all for the purposes of
showing you our resolve right so this is

3784
01:29:21,709 --> 01:29:21,719
showing you our resolve right so this is
 

3785
01:29:21,719 --> 01:29:24,030
showing you our resolve right so this is
the manipulation of risk strategy and a

3786
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:24,040
the manipulation of risk strategy and a
 

3787
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,350
the manipulation of risk strategy and a
lot of the language I just used in

3788
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:26,360
lot of the language I just used in
 

3789
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,709
lot of the language I just used in
describing it to you is language that

3790
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719
describing it to you is language that
 

3791
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:33,709
describing it to you is language that
Thomas Shelly invented right now fast

3792
01:29:33,709 --> 01:29:33,719
Thomas Shelly invented right now fast
 

3793
01:29:33,719 --> 01:29:36,430
Thomas Shelly invented right now fast
forward to the present if Russia were

3794
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:36,440
forward to the present if Russia were
 

3795
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,350
forward to the present if Russia were
you losing in Ukraine that's the one

3796
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:39,360
you losing in Ukraine that's the one
 

3797
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,109
you losing in Ukraine that's the one
scenario I think where Russia would have

3798
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:41,119
scenario I think where Russia would have
 

3799
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:44,470
scenario I think where Russia would have
used nuclear weapons and the question is

3800
01:29:44,470 --> 01:29:44,480
used nuclear weapons and the question is
 

3801
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,270
used nuclear weapons and the question is
how would Russia have used nuclear

3802
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:46,280
how would Russia have used nuclear
 

3803
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,709
how would Russia have used nuclear
weapons again we're assuming that the

3804
01:29:48,709 --> 01:29:48,719
weapons again we're assuming that the
 

3805
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,590
weapons again we're assuming that the
Russians are losing to the ukrainians I

3806
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:51,600
Russians are losing to the ukrainians I
 

3807
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,629
Russians are losing to the ukrainians I
believe

3808
01:29:52,629 --> 01:29:52,639
believe
 

3809
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:54,350
believe
they would have pursued a manipulation

3810
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:54,360
they would have pursued a manipulation
 

3811
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,270
they would have pursued a manipulation
of risk strategy they would have used

3812
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:56,280
of risk strategy they would have used
 

3813
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,629
of risk strategy they would have used
405 30 or4 who knows nuclear weapons

3814
01:29:59,629 --> 01:29:59,639
405 30 or4 who knows nuclear weapons
 

3815
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:02,350
405 30 or4 who knows nuclear weapons
maybe just one in a rural area that

3816
01:30:02,350 --> 01:30:02,360
maybe just one in a rural area that
 

3817
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,950
maybe just one in a rural area that
kills very few people yes exactly and

3818
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:04,960
kills very few people yes exactly and
 

3819
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,270
kills very few people yes exactly and
basically that would spook everybody the

3820
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:08,280
basically that would spook everybody the
 

3821
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,590
basically that would spook everybody the
American just the mushroom cloud yeah

3822
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:10,600
American just the mushroom cloud yeah
 

3823
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,669
American just the mushroom cloud yeah
the it it's because of the threat of

3824
01:30:12,669 --> 01:30:12,679
the it it's because of the threat of
 

3825
01:30:12,679 --> 01:30:15,430
the it it's because of the threat of
escalation right again you your point is

3826
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:15,440
escalation right again you your point is
 

3827
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:17,590
escalation right again you your point is
we're in a mad world I accept that and

3828
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:17,600
we're in a mad world I accept that and
 

3829
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:22,750
we're in a mad world I accept that and
if you have limited nuclear use right we

3830
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:22,760
if you have limited nuclear use right we
 

3831
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:26,189
if you have limited nuclear use right we
understand hardly anything about nuclear

3832
01:30:26,189 --> 01:30:26,199
understand hardly anything about nuclear
 

3833
01:30:26,199 --> 01:30:28,270
understand hardly anything about nuclear
escalation because thank goodness we've

3834
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:28,280
escalation because thank goodness we've
 

3835
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:31,310
escalation because thank goodness we've
never had a nuclear war so once you

3836
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:31,320
never had a nuclear war so once you
 

3837
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,270
never had a nuclear war so once you
throw both sides out on the slippery

3838
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,280
throw both sides out on the slippery
 

3839
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,470
throw both sides out on the slippery
slope even if you only use one nuclear

3840
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:35,480
slope even if you only use one nuclear
 

3841
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:38,590
slope even if you only use one nuclear
weapon in your scenario you don't know

3842
01:30:38,590 --> 01:30:38,600
weapon in your scenario you don't know
 

3843
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,310
weapon in your scenario you don't know
what the escalation Dynamics look like

3844
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:41,320
what the escalation Dynamics look like
 

3845
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:45,510
what the escalation Dynamics look like
so everybody has a powerful incentive to

3846
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,520
so everybody has a powerful incentive to
 

3847
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:48,550
so everybody has a powerful incentive to
put an end to the conflict right away I

3848
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:48,560
put an end to the conflict right away I
 

3849
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,669
put an end to the conflict right away I
might add to you that there were people

3850
01:30:50,669 --> 01:30:50,679
might add to you that there were people
 

3851
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:55,030
might add to you that there were people
who believe that we would not even

3852
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:55,040
who believe that we would not even
 

3853
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:58,990
who believe that we would not even
initiate a manipulation of risk strategy

3854
01:30:58,990 --> 01:30:59,000
initiate a manipulation of risk strategy
 

3855
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,590
initiate a manipulation of risk strategy
in Europe if we were losing to the warsa

3856
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:02,600
in Europe if we were losing to the warsa
 

3857

leaving office that they would not have

01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:12,840
leaving office that they would not have
 

3863
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:16,030
leaving office that they would not have
done it they would have not initiated

01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:16,040
done it they would have not initiated
 

3865
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,149
done it they would have not initiated
nuclear use even limited nuclear use

3866
01:31:18,149 --> 01:31:18,159
nuclear use even limited nuclear use
 

3867
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:19,990
nuclear use even limited nuclear use
that's what we're talking about here

3868
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:20,000
that's what we're talking about here
 

3869
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,390
that's what we're talking about here
they would rather be dead than dead

3870
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:23,400
they would rather be dead than dead
 

3871
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,510
they would rather be dead than dead
right that was the argument too risky

3872
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,520
right that was the argument too risky
 

3873
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,629
right that was the argument too risky
too risky that's exactly right but if

3874
01:31:28,629 --> 01:31:28,639
too risky that's exactly right but if
 

3875
01:31:28,639 --> 01:31:31,830
too risky that's exactly right but if
they had used one nuclear weapon in your

they had used one nuclear weapon in your

01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,590
they had used one nuclear weapon in your
story or three or four in my

story or three or four in my
 

3879
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,350

immediately I only tell you this story

3884
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:43,560
immediately I only tell you this story
 

3885
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,229
immediately I only tell you this story
or lay out this scenario be as an answer

3886
01:31:46,229 --> 01:31:46,239
or lay out this scenario be as an answer
 

3887
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:48,430
or lay out this scenario be as an answer
to your question of how you use nuclear

3888
01:31:48,430 --> 01:31:48,440
to your question of how you use nuclear
 

3889
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:52,109
to your question of how you use nuclear
weapons in a mad world and this is the

3890
01:31:52,109 --> 01:31:52,119
weapons in a mad world and this is the
 

3891
01:31:52,119 --> 01:31:55,550
weapons in a mad world and this is the
answer I this is all very terrifying uh

3892
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:55,560
answer I this is all very terrifying uh
 

3893
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,430
answer I this is all very terrifying uh
perhaps in part it's terrifying to me

3894
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
perhaps in part it's terrifying to me
 

3895
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:00,189
perhaps in part it's terrifying to me
because I can see in the 21st

01:32:00,189 --> 01:32:00,199
because I can see in the 21st
 

3897
01:32:00,199 --> 01:32:02,709
because I can see in the 21st
century China

3898
01:32:02,709 --> 01:32:02,719

way blowing it up somewhere in the
 

3905
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:14,149
way blowing it up somewhere in the
middle of nowhere that kills maybe

3906
01:32:14,149 --> 01:32:14,159
middle of nowhere that kills maybe
 

3907
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:17,629
middle of nowhere that kills maybe
nobody but I'm terrified of seeing the

3923
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:40,390

01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:57,000
emotions the leaders and the populace
 

3937
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,270
emotions the leaders and the populace
and and the way news are reported and

3938
01:32:59,270 --> 01:32:59,280
and and the way news are reported and
 

3939
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:00,750
and and the way news are reported and
then the landscape of risk as you

3940
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:00,760
then the landscape of risk as you
 

3941
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:04,709
then the landscape of risk as you
mentioned shifting like the world's most

3942
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:04,719
mentioned shifting like the world's most
 

3943
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:07,550
mentioned shifting like the world's most
intense nonlinear dynamical

3944
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:07,560
intense nonlinear dynamical
 

3945
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:10,430
intense nonlinear dynamical
system and it it it's just terrifying

3946
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:10,440
system and it it it's just terrifying
 

3947
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,830
system and it it it's just terrifying
because the the the entirety of human

3948
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:12,840
because the the the entirety of human
 

3949
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,470
because the the the entirety of human
civilizations hangs in the balance there

3950
01:33:15,470 --> 01:33:15,480
civilizations hangs in the balance there
 

3951
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:17,590
civilizations hangs in the balance there
and it's like like

3952
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:17,600
and it's like like
 

3953
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,430
and it's like like
this like hundreds of millions of people

3954
01:33:20,430 --> 01:33:20,440
this like hundreds of millions of people
 

3955
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,950
this like hundreds of millions of people
could be dead let's just talk about this

3956
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:22,960
could be dead let's just talk about this
 

3957
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,990
could be dead let's just talk about this
in the context of the Ukraine war

3958
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:27,000
in the context of the Ukraine war
 

3959
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,310
in the context of the Ukraine war
um if uh if the Russians were losing as

3960
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:31,320
um if uh if the Russians were losing as
 

3961
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,550
um if uh if the Russians were losing as
I said before which is not the case

3962
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:33,560
I said before which is not the case
 

3963
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:37,629
I said before which is not the case
anymore but in 2022 it it did look like

3964
01:33:37,629 --> 01:33:37,639
anymore but in 2022 it it did look like
 

3965
01:33:37,639 --> 01:33:41,270
anymore but in 2022 it it did look like
that um if the Russians are losing and

3966
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:41,280
that um if the Russians are losing and
 

3967
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,270
that um if the Russians are losing and
they turn to nuclear weapons the

3968
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:44,280
they turn to nuclear weapons the
 

3969
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,189
they turn to nuclear weapons the
question is how do they use them and

3970
01:33:47,189 --> 01:33:47,199
question is how do they use them and
 

3971
01:33:47,199 --> 01:33:49,910
question is how do they use them and
they would use them in

3972
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:49,920
they would use them in
 

3973
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,629
they would use them in
Ukraine and because Ukraine has no

3974
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:53,639
Ukraine and because Ukraine has no
 

3975
01:33:53,639 --> 01:33:56,430
Ukraine and because Ukraine has no
nuclear weapons of its own Ukraine

3976
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:56,440
nuclear weapons of its own Ukraine
 

3977
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,750
nuclear weapons of its own Ukraine
cannot retaliate it's not a mutual

3978
01:33:59,750 --> 01:33:59,760
cannot retaliate it's not a mutual
 

3979
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,229
cannot retaliate it's not a mutual
assured destruction world it's a case

3980
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:02,239
assured destruction world it's a case
 

3981
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:03,950
assured destruction world it's a case
where one side has nuclear weapons and

3982
01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:03,960
where one side has nuclear weapons and
 

3983
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,189
where one side has nuclear weapons and
the other doesn't that means that the

3984
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:07,199
the other doesn't that means that the
 

3985
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:10,629
the other doesn't that means that the
Russians are likely to think that they

3986
01:34:10,629 --> 01:34:10,639
Russians are likely to think that they
 

3987
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:13,350
Russians are likely to think that they
can get away with using nuclear weapons

3988
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:13,360
can get away with using nuclear weapons
 

3989
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,510
can get away with using nuclear weapons
in ways that would not be the case if

3990
01:34:15,510 --> 01:34:15,520
in ways that would not be the case if
 

3991
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,830
in ways that would not be the case if
they were attacking NATO and therefore

3992
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:17,840
they were attacking NATO and therefore
 

3993
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,990
they were attacking NATO and therefore
it makes nuclear use more likely okay

3994
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:20,000
it makes nuclear use more likely okay
 

3995
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,189
it makes nuclear use more likely okay
that's point one point two is let's

3996
01:34:23,189 --> 01:34:23,199
that's point one point two is let's
 

3997
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,470
that's point one point two is let's
assume that the Russians use two or

3998
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:25,480
assume that the Russians use two or
 

3999
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,030
assume that the Russians use two or
three nuclear weapons in a remote area

4000
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:28,040
three nuclear weapons in a remote area
 

4001
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,590
three nuclear weapons in a remote area
sweating by the way just just as a

4002
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:30,600
sweating by the way just just as a
 

4003
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:33,189
sweating by the way just just as a
commentary the terrifying yeah the

4004
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:33,199
commentary the terrifying yeah the
 

4005
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:36,990
commentary the terrifying yeah the
question then is what does the West do

4006
01:34:36,990 --> 01:34:37,000
question then is what does the West do
 

4007
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,629
question then is what does the West do
now mccrone has said and Biden has also

4008
01:34:39,629 --> 01:34:39,639
now mccrone has said and Biden has also
 

4009
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:42,229
now mccrone has said and Biden has also
I think implicitly made this clear we

4010
01:34:42,229 --> 01:34:42,239
I think implicitly made this clear we
 

4011
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:45,629
I think implicitly made this clear we
would not retaliate with nuclear weapons

4012
01:34:45,629 --> 01:34:45,639
would not retaliate with nuclear weapons
 

4013
01:34:45,639 --> 01:34:47,189
would not retaliate with nuclear weapons
if the Russians were to attack with a

4014
01:34:47,189 --> 01:34:47,199
if the Russians were to attack with a
 

4015
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,550
if the Russians were to attack with a
handful of nuclear weapons in Western

4016
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:49,560
handful of nuclear weapons in Western
 

4017
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,750
handful of nuclear weapons in Western
Ukraine but then the question question

4018
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:51,760
Ukraine but then the question question
 

4019
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:55,030
Ukraine but then the question question
is what would we do MH and if you listen

4020
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,040
is what would we do MH and if you listen
 

4021
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,990
is what would we do MH and if you listen
to David Petraeus what David Petraeus

4022
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,000
to David Petraeus what David Petraeus
 

4023
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,950
to David Petraeus what David Petraeus
says is that we should attack the

4024
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:00,960
says is that we should attack the
 

4025
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,350
says is that we should attack the
Russian naval Assets in the Black

4026
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:05,360
Russian naval Assets in the Black
 

4027
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:10,629
Russian naval Assets in the Black
Sea and attack Russian forces in

4028
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:10,639
Sea and attack Russian forces in
 

4029
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:13,390
Sea and attack Russian forces in
Ukraine well once you do that you have a

4030
01:35:13,390 --> 01:35:13,400
Ukraine well once you do that you have a
 

4031
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:16,669
Ukraine well once you do that you have a
great power of War you have NATO versus

4032
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:16,679
great power of War you have NATO versus
 

4033
01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:18,430
great power of War you have NATO versus
Russia which is another way of saying

4034
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:18,440
Russia which is another way of saying
 

4035
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,870
Russia which is another way of saying
you have the United States versus Russia

4036
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:20,880
you have the United States versus Russia
 

4037
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,470
you have the United States versus Russia
we're now a great power War they have

4038
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:23,480
we're now a great power War they have
 

4039
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,790
we're now a great power War they have
nuclear weapons we have nuclear weapons

4040
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:25,800
nuclear weapons we have nuclear weapons
 

4041
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,950
nuclear weapons we have nuclear weapons
they've used nuclear weapons what is the

4042
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:28,960
they've used nuclear weapons what is the
 

4043
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,709
they've used nuclear weapons what is the
happy ending here and just to take it a

4044
01:35:31,709 --> 01:35:31,719
happy ending here and just to take it a
 

4045
01:35:31,719 --> 01:35:34,669
happy ending here and just to take it a
step further and go back to our earlier

4046
01:35:34,669 --> 01:35:34,679
step further and go back to our earlier
 

4047
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:37,149
step further and go back to our earlier
discussion about moving NATO up to

4048
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:37,159
discussion about moving NATO up to
 

4049
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:40,430
discussion about moving NATO up to
Russia's borders the point I made which

4050
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:40,440
Russia's borders the point I made which
 

4051
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,430
Russia's borders the point I made which
you surely agree with is that the

4052
01:35:42,430 --> 01:35:42,440
you surely agree with is that the
 

4053
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:45,229
you surely agree with is that the
Russians are very fearful when they see

4054
01:35:45,229 --> 01:35:45,239
Russians are very fearful when they see
 

4055
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:48,350
Russians are very fearful when they see
NATO coming up to their border well

4056
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:48,360
NATO coming up to their border well
 

4057
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,070
NATO coming up to their border well
here's a case where not only is NATO

4058
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:51,080
here's a case where not only is NATO
 

4059
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:52,870
here's a case where not only is NATO
come up to their border but they're in a

4060
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:52,880
come up to their border but they're in a
 

4061
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,870
come up to their border but they're in a
war with NATO right on their

01:35:55,870 --> 01:35:55,880
war with NATO right on their
 

4063
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,669
war with NATO right on their
border what do the escalation Dynamics

4064
01:35:58,669 --> 01:35:58,679
border what do the escalation Dynamics
 

4065
01:35:58,679 --> 01:36:00,990
border what do the escalation Dynamics
look like there you know what the answer

4066
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:01,000
look like there you know what the answer
 

4067
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,830
look like there you know what the answer
is who knows that's should scare the

4068
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:03,840
is who knows that's should scare the
 

4069

01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:34,830
that ended up actually killing a very
large number of people I

4094
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:34,840
large number of people I
 

4095
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:37,390
large number of people I
mean uh

4096
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:37,400
mean uh
 

4097
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,030
mean uh
just that the the escalation that

4098
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:40,040
just that the the escalation that
 

4099
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,669
just that the the escalation that
happens there just happens in in a

4100
01:36:41,669 --> 01:36:41,679
happens there just happens in in a
 

4101
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:43,510
happens there just happens in in a
matter of minutes and the only way to

4102
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,520
matter of minutes and the only way to
 

4103
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,109
matter of minutes and the only way to
stop that is communication between

4104
01:36:46,109 --> 01:36:46,119
stop that is communication between
 

4105
01:36:46,119 --> 01:36:49,709
stop that is communication between
leaders and that to me is a big argument

4106
01:36:49,709 --> 01:36:49,719
leaders and that to me is a big argument
 

4107
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:51,910
leaders and that to me is a big argument
for ongoing communication

4108
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:51,920
for ongoing communication
 

4109
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,510
for ongoing communication
you know this's a story that during the

4110
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:53,520
you know this's a story that during the
 

4111
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,390
you know this's a story that during the
Cuban Missile Crisis um Kennedy put out

4112
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:56,400
Cuban Missile Crisis um Kennedy put out
 

4113
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,470
Cuban Missile Crisis um Kennedy put out
the word uh no

4114
01:36:58,470 --> 01:36:58,480
the word uh no
 

4115
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,950
the word uh no
aircraft uh under any circumstances or

4116
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:01,960
aircraft uh under any circumstances or
 

4117
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:05,669
aircraft uh under any circumstances or
to penetrate Soviet airspace yeah yeah

4118
01:37:05,669 --> 01:37:05,679
to penetrate Soviet airspace yeah yeah
 

4119
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,390
to penetrate Soviet airspace yeah yeah
and he then found out a few days later

4120
01:37:09,390 --> 01:37:09,400
and he then found out a few days later
 

4121
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,790
and he then found out a few days later
that uh some guy hadn't gotten the

4122
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:12,800
that uh some guy hadn't gotten the
 

4123
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,910
that uh some guy hadn't gotten the
message and had penetrated in an

4124
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:15,920
message and had penetrated in an
 

4125
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:19,629
message and had penetrated in an
aircraft deep into Soviet airspace yeah

4126
01:37:19,629 --> 01:37:19,639
aircraft deep into Soviet airspace yeah
 

4127
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:22,629
aircraft deep into Soviet airspace yeah
and uh this supports your basic point

4128
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:22,639
and uh this supports your basic point
 

4129
01:37:22,639 --> 01:37:26,430
and uh this supports your basic point
that you know uh bad things happen and

4130
01:37:26,430 --> 01:37:26,440
that you know uh bad things happen and
 

4131
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:29,229
that you know uh bad things happen and
uh and again the overarching point here

4132
01:37:29,229 --> 01:37:29,239
uh and again the overarching point here
 

4133
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:31,510
uh and again the overarching point here
is we've never done this before

4134
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:31,520
is we've never done this before
 

4135
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:33,790
is we've never done this before
thankfully therefore we don't have a lot

4136
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:33,800
thankfully therefore we don't have a lot
 

4137
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:36,390
thankfully therefore we don't have a lot
of experience as to how it plays itself

4138
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:36,400
of experience as to how it plays itself
 

4139
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,109
of experience as to how it plays itself
out it it's really a theoretical

4140
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:39,119
out it it's really a theoretical
 

4141
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,270
out it it's really a theoretical
Enterprise because there's no empirical

4142
01:37:41,270 --> 01:37:41,280
Enterprise because there's no empirical
 

4143
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:44,390
Enterprise because there's no empirical
basis for talking about

4144
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:44,400
basis for talking about
 

4145
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:46,629
basis for talking about
escalation uh you know in a nuclear

4146
01:37:46,629 --> 01:37:46,639
escalation uh you know in a nuclear
 

4147
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,270
escalation uh you know in a nuclear
crisis and that of course is a wonderful

4148
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:49,280
crisis and that of course is a wonderful
 

4149
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,229
crisis and that of course is a wonderful
thing well in general the uh the human

4155
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:01,589

01:38:06,199 --> 01:38:08,910

far it's been rising but uh it's not

4162
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:08,920
far it's been rising but uh it's not
 

4163
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:11,550
far it's been rising but uh it's not
obvious that it doesn't end in fact I

4164
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:11,560
obvious that it doesn't end in fact I
 

4165
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:14,229
obvious that it doesn't end in fact I
think about aliens a lot and the fact

4166
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:14,239
think about aliens a lot and the fact
 

4167
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:16,550
think about aliens a lot and the fact
that we don't see aliens makes me

4168
01:38:16,550 --> 01:38:16,560
that we don't see aliens makes me
 

4169
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,910
that we don't see aliens makes me
suspect it's not so easy to survive in

4170
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:19,920
suspect it's not so easy to survive in

this complicated world of s Switching

01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:22,760
this complicated world of s Switching
 

4173
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:24,350
this complicated world of s Switching
gears a little bit and going to a

4174
01:38:24,350 --> 01:38:24,360
gears a little bit and going to a
 

4175
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,629
gears a little bit and going to a

01:38:25,629 --> 01:38:25,639
different part of the

war let me ask you about the uh

4180
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,400
war let me ask you about the uh
 

4181
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,669
war let me ask you about the uh
situation in Israel uh why did Hamas

4182
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
situation in Israel uh why did Hamas
 

4183
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:40,550
situation in Israel uh why did Hamas
attack Israel on October 7th 2023 as you

4184
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:40,560
attack Israel on October 7th 2023 as you
 

4185
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,830
attack Israel on October 7th 2023 as you
understand the

4186
01:38:43,830 --> 01:38:43,840

 

4187
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,950

situation what was the reason that

4188
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:45,960
situation what was the reason that
 

4189
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:47,229
situation what was the reason that
attack

4190
01:38:47,229 --> 01:38:47,239
attack
 

4191
01:38:47,239 --> 01:38:50,550
attack
happened well I think the main reason

4192
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:50,560
happened well I think the main reason
 

4193
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:55,030
happened well I think the main reason
was that you had this suffocating

4194
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,040
was that you had this suffocating
 

4195
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,070
was that you had this suffocating
occupation I think as long as the

4196
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:58,080
occupation I think as long as the
 

4197
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,109
occupation I think as long as the
occupation persists the Palestinians are

4198
01:39:02,109 --> 01:39:02,119
occupation persists the Palestinians are
 

4199
01:39:02,119 --> 01:39:03,470
occupation persists the Palestinians are
going to

4200
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:03,480
going to
 

4201
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:06,470
going to
resist uh as you well know this is not

4202
01:39:06,470 --> 01:39:06,480
resist uh as you well know this is not
 

4203
01:39:06,480 --> 01:39:08,589
resist uh as you well know this is not
the first time there has been a

4204
01:39:08,589 --> 01:39:08,599
the first time there has been a
 

4205
01:39:08,599 --> 01:39:11,510
the first time there has been a
Palestinian Uprising there was the first

4206
01:39:11,510 --> 01:39:11,520
Palestinian Uprising there was the first
 

4207
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:14,350
Palestinian Uprising there was the first
inata there was the second inata now

4208
01:39:14,350 --> 01:39:14,360
inata there was the second inata now
 

4209
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:18,109
inata there was the second inata now
there's October 7th and their uprisings

4210
01:39:18,109 --> 01:39:18,119
there's October 7th and their uprisings
 

4211
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:21,629
there's October 7th and their uprisings
besides those three uh so

4212
01:39:21,629 --> 01:39:21,639
besides those three uh so
 

4213
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:23,870
besides those three uh so
this is not terribly

4214
01:39:23,870 --> 01:39:23,880
this is not terribly
 

4215
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:26,229
this is not terribly
surprising uh a lot of people

4216
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:26,239
surprising uh a lot of people
 

4217
01:39:26,239 --> 01:39:29,430
surprising uh a lot of people
hypothesize that uh this attack was due

4218
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,440
hypothesize that uh this attack was due
 

4219
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:33,910
hypothesize that uh this attack was due
to the fact that uh the Israelis the

4220
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:33,920
to the fact that uh the Israelis the
 

4221
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,430
to the fact that uh the Israelis the
Saudis and the Americans were working

4222
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:36,440
Saudis and the Americans were working
 

4223
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,790
Saudis and the Americans were working
together to Foster another Abraham

4224
01:39:39,790 --> 01:39:39,800
together to Foster another Abraham
 

4225
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:42,430
together to Foster another Abraham
Accord uh and that the Palestinians

4226
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:42,440
Accord uh and that the Palestinians
 

4227
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:45,149
Accord uh and that the Palestinians
would in effect be sold down the river

4228
01:39:45,149 --> 01:39:45,159
would in effect be sold down the river
 

4229
01:39:45,159 --> 01:39:48,790
would in effect be sold down the river
uh I think given the fact that this was

4230
01:39:48,790 --> 01:39:48,800
uh I think given the fact that this was
 

4231
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:51,510
uh I think given the fact that this was
in the planning stages for for probably

4232
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:51,520
in the planning stages for for probably
 

4233
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,830
in the planning stages for for probably
about 2 years uh and the Abraham Accords

4234
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:55,840
about 2 years uh and the Abraham Accords
 

4235
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,950
about 2 years uh and the Abraham Accords
with regard to Saudi Arabia are

4236
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:57,960
with regard to Saudi Arabia are
 

4237
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,470
with regard to Saudi Arabia are
relatively new phenomenon I don't think

4238
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:00,480
relatively new phenomenon I don't think
 

4239
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:04,470
relatively new phenomenon I don't think
that's uh the main driving force here I

4240
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:04,480
that's uh the main driving force here I
 

4241
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,550
that's uh the main driving force here I
think the main driving force is that the

4242
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:07,560
think the main driving force is that the
 

4243
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,709
think the main driving force is that the
Palestinians uh feel oppressed as they

4244
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:10,719
Palestinians uh feel oppressed as they
 

4245
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:14,870
Palestinians uh feel oppressed as they
should and that this was uh a resistance

4246
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:14,880
should and that this was uh a resistance
 

4247
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,950
should and that this was uh a resistance
move they were resisting the Israeli

4248
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:17,960
move they were resisting the Israeli
 

4249
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:21,750
move they were resisting the Israeli
occupation so that resistance

4250
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:21,760

in

4268
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:47,960
in
 

4269
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:51,910
in
200 uh 8 2009 started I think right

4270
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:51,920
200 uh 8 2009 started I think right
 

4271
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:54,990
200 uh 8 2009 started I think right
after Christmas 2008 and it ended right

4272
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:55,000
after Christmas 2008 and it ended right
 

4273
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,270
after Christmas 2008 and it ended right
before President Obama took office uh in

4274
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:58,280
before President Obama took office uh in
 

4275
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,589
before President Obama took office uh in
January 2009 and

4276
01:41:01,589 --> 01:41:01,599
January 2009 and
 

4277
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:05,310
January 2009 and
uh the Israelis periodically do what

4278
01:41:05,310 --> 01:41:05,320
uh the Israelis periodically do what
 

4279
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,109
uh the Israelis periodically do what
they call mowing the lawn where they go

4280
01:41:08,109 --> 01:41:08,119
they call mowing the lawn where they go
 

4281
01:41:08,119 --> 01:41:11,189
they call mowing the lawn where they go
into Gaza and they pound the

4282
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:11,199
into Gaza and they pound the
 

4283
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:14,030
into Gaza and they pound the
Palestinians uh to remind them that

4284
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:14,040
Palestinians uh to remind them that
 

4285
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,550
Palestinians uh to remind them that
they're not supposed to rise up and

4286
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:16,560
they're not supposed to rise up and
 

4287
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,550
they're not supposed to rise up and
cause any problem uh

4288
01:41:19,550 --> 01:41:19,560
cause any problem uh
 

4289
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:23,510
cause any problem uh
so there's no question in my mind that

4290
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:23,520
so there's no question in my mind that
 

4291
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,310
so there's no question in my mind that
the uh the Hamas forces understood full

4292
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
the uh the Hamas forces understood full
 

4293
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:31,470
the uh the Hamas forces understood full
well that the Israelis would retaliate

4294
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:31,480
well that the Israelis would retaliate
 

4295
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:33,669
well that the Israelis would retaliate
and they would retaliate in force as

4296
01:41:33,669 --> 01:41:33,679
and they would retaliate in force as
 

4297
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,070
and they would retaliate in force as
they have done yeah even the metaphor of

4298
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:37,080
they have done yeah even the metaphor of
 

4299
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,790
they have done yeah even the metaphor of
mowing the lawn is disturbing to me in

4300
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:39,800
mowing the lawn is disturbing to me in
 

4301
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,510
mowing the lawn is disturbing to me in
many

4302
01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:41,520
many
 

4303
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,229
many
ways um I actually

4304
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:44,239
ways um I actually
 

4305
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:49,109
ways um I actually
saw uh Norman filastine I think say that

4306
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:49,119
saw uh Norman filastine I think say that
 

4307
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,310
saw uh Norman filastine I think say that
well then if you use that metaphor then

4308
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:51,320
well then if you use that metaphor then
 

4309
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:53,310
well then if you use that metaphor then
you could say that Hamas was also mowing

4310
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:53,320
you could say that Hamas was also mowing
 

4311
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:56,550
you could say that Hamas was also mowing
the lawn that's such a

4312
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:56,560
the lawn that's such a
 

4313
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:59,629
the lawn that's such a
horrific image because the result on

4314
01:41:59,629 --> 01:41:59,639
horrific image because the result on
 

4315
01:41:59,639 --> 01:42:02,149
horrific image because the result on
either side is just the death of

4316
01:42:02,149 --> 01:42:02,159
either side is just the death of
 

4317
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,030
either side is just the death of
civilians I mean let me ask you about

4318
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:04,040
civilians I mean let me ask you about
 

4319
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,310
civilians I mean let me ask you about
the death of civilians so during the

4320
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:06,320
the death of civilians so during the
 

4321
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,950
the death of civilians so during the
attack 1400 Israelis were

4322
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:08,960
attack 1400 Israelis were
 

4323
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,589
attack 1400 Israelis were
killed over 240 were taken hostage and

4324
01:42:12,589 --> 01:42:12,599
killed over 240 were taken hostage and
 

4325
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:15,109
killed over 240 were taken hostage and
then in response as we sit

4326
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:15,119
then in response as we sit
 

4327
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:18,709
then in response as we sit
today uh Israel's military response has

4328
01:42:18,709 --> 01:42:18,719
today uh Israel's military response has
 

4329
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:22,550
today uh Israel's military response has
killed over 10,000 people people in Gaza

4330
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:22,560
killed over 10,000 people people in Gaza
 

4331
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,950
killed over 10,000 people people in Gaza
and given the nature of the demographics

4332
01:42:24,950 --> 01:42:24,960
and given the nature of the demographics
 

4333
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:26,910
and given the nature of the demographics
it's it's a very heavily young

4334
01:42:26,910 --> 01:42:26,920
it's it's a very heavily young
 

4335
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,470
it's it's a very heavily young
population over 40% of them are under

4336
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:29,480
population over 40% of them are under
 

4337
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:32,910
population over 40% of them are under
the age of 18 of those killed that's uh

4338
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:32,920
the age of 18 of those killed that's uh
 

4339
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:35,030
the age of 18 of those killed that's uh
of course according to Ministry of

4340
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
of course according to Ministry of
 

4341
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,350
of course according to Ministry of
Health of Palestinian

4342
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,360
Health of Palestinian
 

4343
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:40,350
Health of Palestinian
Authority so what do you think is the

4344
01:42:40,350 --> 01:42:40,360
Authority so what do you think is the
 

4345
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:43,149
Authority so what do you think is the
long-term effect on the prospect of

4346
01:42:43,149 --> 01:42:43,159
long-term effect on the prospect of
 

4347
01:42:43,159 --> 01:42:45,350
long-term effect on the prospect of
Peace when so many civilians

4348
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:45,360
Peace when so many civilians
 

4349
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:49,470
Peace when so many civilians
die I mean I think it's disastrous

4350
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:49,480
die I mean I think it's disastrous
 

4351
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:53,350
die I mean I think it's disastrous
U uh I

4352
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:53,360

 

4353
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:56,430

mean the only way you're going to get

4354
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:56,440
mean the only way you're going to get
 

4355
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:59,990
mean the only way you're going to get
peace here uh is if you have a two-state

4356
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:00,000
peace here uh is if you have a two-state
 

4357
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,149
peace here uh is if you have a two-state
solution um where the Palestinians have

4358
01:43:03,149 --> 01:43:03,159
solution um where the Palestinians have
 

4359
01:43:03,159 --> 01:43:06,270
solution um where the Palestinians have
a sovereign state of their own and there

4360
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:06,280
a sovereign state of their own and there
 

4361
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:09,629
a sovereign state of their own and there
is a sovereign Jewish State uh and these

4362
01:43:09,629 --> 01:43:09,639
is a sovereign Jewish State uh and these
 

4363
01:43:09,639 --> 01:43:12,470
is a sovereign Jewish State uh and these
two states live side by side American

4364
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:12,480
two states live side by side American
 

4365
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,229
two states live side by side American
Presidents since Jimmy Carter have

4366
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:14,239
Presidents since Jimmy Carter have
 

4367
01:43:14,239 --> 01:43:16,589
Presidents since Jimmy Carter have
understood this full well and this is

4368
01:43:16,589 --> 01:43:16,599
understood this full well and this is
 

4369
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:18,270
understood this full well and this is
why we have pushed very hard for

4370
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:18,280
why we have pushed very hard for
 

4371
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:20,709
why we have pushed very hard for
two-state solution indeed many americ

4372

American Jews and many Israelis have
 

4375
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,990
American Jews and many Israelis have
pushed for a two-state solution because

4376
01:43:25,990 --> 01:43:26,000
pushed for a two-state solution because
 

4377
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,189
pushed for a two-state solution because
they think that that is the only way

4378
01:43:28,189 --> 01:43:28,199
they think that that is the only way
 

4379
01:43:28,199 --> 01:43:32,510
they think that that is the only way
you're going to get uh peace uh between

4380
01:43:32,510 --> 01:43:32,520
you're going to get uh peace uh between
 

4381
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:35,870
you're going to get uh peace uh between
the two sides uh but what's happened

4382
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:35,880
the two sides uh but what's happened
 

4383
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:38,310
the two sides uh but what's happened
here is that in recent years the

4384
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:38,320
here is that in recent years the
 

4385
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:41,189
here is that in recent years the
Israelis have lost all interest in a

01:43:41,189 --> 01:43:41,199
Israelis have lost all interest in a
 

4387
01:43:41,199 --> 01:43:43,750
Israelis have lost all interest in a
two-state solution uh and it's in large

4388
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:43,760
two-state solution uh and it's in large
 

4389
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,430
two-state solution uh and it's in large
part because the political center of

01:43:45,430 --> 01:43:45,440
part because the political center of
 

4391
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,910
part because the political center of
gravity in Israel has steadily moved to

4392
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:47,920
gravity in Israel has steadily moved to
 

4393
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,550
gravity in Israel has steadily moved to
the right uh when I was a young boy bo

uh the political center of gravity in
 

4397
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,510
uh the political center of gravity in
Israel was much further to the left than

a position now the political center of
 

4403
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,830
a position now the political center of
gravity where there's hardly any support

4404
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:06,840
gravity where there's hardly any support
 

4405
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,510
gravity where there's hardly any support
for two-state solution and Netanyahu and

for two-state solution and Netanyahu and
 

4407
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,430
for two-state solution and Netanyahu and
the rest of the people in his government

4408
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:13,440
the rest of the people in his government
 

4409
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,910
the rest of the people in his government
were in favor or are in favor of a

4410
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:15,920
were in favor or are in favor of a
 

4411
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:17,709
were in favor or are in favor of a
greater Israel there's just no question

4412
01:44:17,709 --> 01:44:17,719
greater Israel there's just no question
 

4413
01:44:17,719 --> 01:44:18,669
greater Israel there's just no question
about

4414
01:44:18,669 --> 01:44:18,679
about
 

4415
01:44:18,679 --> 01:44:21,510
about
that well

4416
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:21,520
that well
 

4417
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,950
that well
on top of that you now have had a war

4418
01:44:25,950 --> 01:44:25,960
on top of that you now have had a war
 

4419
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:27,270
on top of that you now have had a war
where as you

4420
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:27,280
where as you
 

4421
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,390
where as you
described huge numbers of civilians have

4422
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:30,400
described huge numbers of civilians have
 

4423
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:34,390
described huge numbers of civilians have
been killed and you already had bad

4424
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:34,400
been killed and you already had bad
 

4425
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,510
been killed and you already had bad
blood between the Palestinians and the

4426
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:36,520
blood between the Palestinians and the
 

4427
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,830
blood between the Palestinians and the
Israelis before this

4428
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:39,840
Israelis before this
 

4429
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,310
Israelis before this
conflict uh and you can imagine how

4430
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:43,320
conflict uh and you can imagine how
 

4431
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,870
conflict uh and you can imagine how
people on each side now feel about

4432
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:45,880
people on each side now feel about
 

4433
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,870
people on each side now feel about
people on the other side so even if you

4434
01:44:48,870 --> 01:44:48,880
people on the other side so even if you
 

4435
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:50,950
people on the other side so even if you
didn't have this opposition in inside

4436
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:50,960
didn't have this opposition in inside
 

4437
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,470
didn't have this opposition in inside
Israel to a two-state

4438
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:53,480
Israel to a two-state
 

4439
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,109
Israel to a two-state
solution how could you possibly get the

4440
01:44:56,109 --> 01:44:56,119
solution how could you possibly get the
 

4441
01:44:56,119 --> 01:44:59,910
solution how could you possibly get the
Israelis now to agree to a two-state

4442
01:44:59,910 --> 01:44:59,920
Israelis now to agree to a two-state
 

4443
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,310
Israelis now to agree to a two-state
solution I think for the foreseeable

4444
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:02,320
solution I think for the foreseeable
 

4445
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,990
solution I think for the foreseeable
future the animosity inside Israel

4446
01:45:04,990 --> 01:45:05,000
future the animosity inside Israel
 

4447
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,270
future the animosity inside Israel
towards the Palestinians is so great

4448
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:08,280
towards the Palestinians is so great
 

4449
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:10,149
towards the Palestinians is so great
that it is impossible to move the

4450
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:10,159
that it is impossible to move the
 

4451
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,229
that it is impossible to move the
Israelis in that direction and the

4452
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:12,239
Israelis in that direction and the
 

4453
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:14,750
Israelis in that direction and the
Israelis here are the key players more

4454
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:14,760
Israelis here are the key players more
 

4455
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:17,149
Israelis here are the key players more
so than the Palestinians because it's

4456
01:45:17,149 --> 01:45:17,159
so than the Palestinians because it's
 

4457
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:20,550
so than the Palestinians because it's
the Israelis who control greater Israel

4458
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:20,560
the Israelis who control greater Israel
 

4459
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,189
the Israelis who control greater Israel
it's the Israelis who you have to

4460
01:45:22,189 --> 01:45:22,199
it's the Israelis who you have to
 

4461
01:45:22,199 --> 01:45:24,270
it's the Israelis who you have to
convince now I want to be clear here you

4462
01:45:24,270 --> 01:45:24,280
convince now I want to be clear here you
 

4463
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:26,870
convince now I want to be clear here you
also ultimately have to get around the

4464
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:26,880
also ultimately have to get around the
 

4465
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,350
also ultimately have to get around the
fact that Hamas right is not committed

4466
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:30,360
fact that Hamas right is not committed
 

4467
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:33,310
fact that Hamas right is not committed
to a two-state solution but I think that

4468
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:33,320
to a two-state solution but I think that
 

4469
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:36,270
to a two-state solution but I think that
problem could be dealt with it's

4470
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:36,280
problem could be dealt with it's
 

4471
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:38,149
problem could be dealt with it's
important to understand that Arafat and

4472
01:45:38,149 --> 01:45:38,159
important to understand that Arafat and
 

4473
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:40,790
important to understand that Arafat and
the PLO was once adamantly opposed to a

4474
01:45:40,790 --> 01:45:40,800
the PLO was once adamantly opposed to a
 

4475
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:43,510
the PLO was once adamantly opposed to a
two-state solution but Arafat came

4476
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:43,520
two-state solution but Arafat came
 

4477
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,629
two-state solution but Arafat came
around to understand that that was

4478
01:45:45,629 --> 01:45:45,639
around to understand that that was
 

4479
01:45:45,639 --> 01:45:49,750
around to understand that that was
really the only hope for settling this

4480
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:49,760
really the only hope for settling this
 

4481
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,950
really the only hope for settling this
and he became became a proponent of a

4482
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:51,960
and he became became a proponent of a
 

4483
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:53,589
and he became became a proponent of a
two-state solution and that's true of

4484
01:45:53,589 --> 01:45:53,599
two-state solution and that's true of
 

4485
01:45:53,599 --> 01:45:56,669
two-state solution and that's true of
makhmud abas who runs the PA in the West

4486
01:45:56,669 --> 01:45:56,679
makhmud abas who runs the PA in the West
 

4487
01:45:56,679 --> 01:45:59,270
makhmud abas who runs the PA in the West
Bank it's not true of Hamas at this

4488
01:45:59,270 --> 01:45:59,280
Bank it's not true of Hamas at this
 

4489
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,870
Bank it's not true of Hamas at this
point in time they want a one-state

4490
01:46:00,870 --> 01:46:00,880
point in time they want a one-state
 

4491
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:03,629
point in time they want a one-state
solution they want a Palestinian State

4492
01:46:03,629 --> 01:46:03,639
solution they want a Palestinian State
 

4493
01:46:03,639 --> 01:46:05,669
solution they want a Palestinian State
and of course the Israelis want a

4494
01:46:05,669 --> 01:46:05,679
and of course the Israelis want a
 

4495
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:08,189
and of course the Israelis want a
one-state solution too which is a Jewish

4496
01:46:08,189 --> 01:46:08,199
one-state solution too which is a Jewish
 

4497
01:46:08,199 --> 01:46:11,950
one-state solution too which is a Jewish
state that controls all of U all of

4498
01:46:11,950 --> 01:46:11,960
state that controls all of U all of
 

4499
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,950
state that controls all of U all of
Greater

4500
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:12,960
Greater
 

4501
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:16,390
Greater
Israel so the question is can you get

4502
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:16,400
Israel so the question is can you get
 

4503
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:18,470
Israel so the question is can you get
some sort of agreement and I think to

4504
01:46:18,470 --> 01:46:18,480
some sort of agreement and I think to
 

4505
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,750
some sort of agreement and I think to
get to your the Nu of your question

4506
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:20,760
get to your the Nu of your question
 

4507
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:23,270
get to your the Nu of your question
given what's just happened uh it's

4508
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:23,280
given what's just happened uh it's
 

4509
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,229
given what's just happened uh it's
almost impossible to imagine that

4510
01:46:25,229 --> 01:46:25,239
almost impossible to imagine that
 

4511
01:46:25,239 --> 01:46:28,629
almost impossible to imagine that
happening anytime soon the cynical

4512
01:46:28,629 --> 01:46:28,639
happening anytime soon the cynical
 

4513
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:31,430
happening anytime soon the cynical
perspective here is that uh those in

4514
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:31,440
perspective here is that uh those in
 

4515
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:34,589
perspective here is that uh those in
power benefit from conflict while the

4516
01:46:34,589 --> 01:46:34,599
power benefit from conflict while the
 

4517
01:46:34,599 --> 01:46:37,589
power benefit from conflict while the
people on both sides suffer is there

4518
01:46:37,589 --> 01:46:37,599
people on both sides suffer is there
 

4519
01:46:37,599 --> 01:46:39,709
people on both sides suffer is there
degree of Truth to that or for the

4520
01:46:39,709 --> 01:46:39,719
degree of Truth to that or for the
 

4521
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:42,109
degree of Truth to that or for the
people in power to maintain power

4522
01:46:42,109 --> 01:46:42,119
people in power to maintain power
 

4523
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:45,030
people in power to maintain power
conflict needs to continue no I I don't

4524
01:46:45,030 --> 01:46:45,040
conflict needs to continue no I I don't
 

4525
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,750
conflict needs to continue no I I don't
believe that I mean just to take the

4526
01:46:46,750 --> 01:46:46,760
believe that I mean just to take the
 

4527
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:48,790
believe that I mean just to take the
Netanyahu government or any Israeli

4528
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:48,800
Netanyahu government or any Israeli
 

4529
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:51,030
Netanyahu government or any Israeli
government that maintains

4530
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:51,040
government that maintains
 

4531
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:54,950
government that maintains
uh the occupation what you want is you

4532
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:54,960
uh the occupation what you want is you
 

4533
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:58,470
uh the occupation what you want is you
want a Palestinian population that

4534
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:58,480
want a Palestinian population that
 

4535
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:01,830
want a Palestinian population that
submits to Israeli domination of Greater

4536
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:01,840
submits to Israeli domination of Greater
 

4537
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,910
submits to Israeli domination of Greater
Israel you don't want resistance you

4538
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:03,920
Israel you don't want resistance you
 

4539
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,470
Israel you don't want resistance you
don't want an inada you don't want what

4540
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:06,480
don't want an inada you don't want what
 

4541
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:08,990
don't want an inada you don't want what
happened on October 7th in fact I think

4542
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:09,000
happened on October 7th in fact I think
 

4543
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,750
happened on October 7th in fact I think
one of the principal reasons that the

4544
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:10,760
one of the principal reasons that the
 

4545
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:15,870
one of the principal reasons that the
Israelis are pounding Gaza and killing

4546
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:15,880
Israelis are pounding Gaza and killing
 

4547
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:18,390
Israelis are pounding Gaza and killing
huge numbers of civilians punishing the

4548
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:18,400
huge numbers of civilians punishing the
 

4549
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,149
huge numbers of civilians punishing the
civilian population and way that clearly

4550
01:47:21,149 --> 01:47:21,159
civilian population and way that clearly
 

4551
01:47:21,159 --> 01:47:24,390
civilian population and way that clearly
violate the laws of war is because they

4552
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:24,400
violate the laws of war is because they
 

4553
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:27,510
violate the laws of war is because they
want the Palestinians to understand that

4554
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,520
want the Palestinians to understand that
 

4555
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:30,149
want the Palestinians to understand that
they are not allowed to rise up and

4556
01:47:30,149 --> 01:47:30,159
they are not allowed to rise up and
 

4557
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:33,149
they are not allowed to rise up and
resist the occupation that's their goal

4558
01:47:33,149 --> 01:47:33,159
resist the occupation that's their goal
 

4559
01:47:33,159 --> 01:47:35,830
resist the occupation that's their goal
so I think the Israelis would prefer

4560
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:35,840
so I think the Israelis would prefer
 

4561
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,510
so I think the Israelis would prefer
that the Palestinians roll over and

4562
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:38,520
that the Palestinians roll over and
 

4563
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,229
that the Palestinians roll over and
accept submission in terms of the people

4564
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:42,239
accept submission in terms of the people
 

4565
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:45,030
accept submission in terms of the people
who live in Gaza to include the elites

4566
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,040
who live in Gaza to include the elites
 

4567

who live in Gaza to include the elites
and the people who live in the West Bank

and the people who live in the West Bank
to include the elites they would much

4570
01:47:50,030 --> 01:47:50,040

prefer prer to move to some sort of

4572
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:52,560
prefer prer to move to some sort of
 

4573
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,109
prefer prer to move to some sort of
situation where uh the Palestinians have

4574
01:47:56,109 --> 01:47:56,119
situation where uh the Palestinians have
 

4575
01:47:56,119 --> 01:47:58,310
situation where uh the Palestinians have
a state of their own I think in the case

4576
01:47:58,310 --> 01:47:58,320
a state of their own I think in the case
 

4577
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:02,109
a state of their own I think in the case
of the pa uh under abas they would

4578
01:48:02,109 --> 01:48:02,119
of the pa uh under abas they would
 

4579
01:48:02,119 --> 01:48:04,669
of the pa uh under abas they would
accept a two-state solution I think what

4580
01:48:04,669 --> 01:48:04,679
accept a two-state solution I think what
 

4581
01:48:04,679 --> 01:48:06,870
accept a two-state solution I think what
at this point in time Hamas wants is a

4582
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:06,880
at this point in time Hamas wants is a
 

4583
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,470
at this point in time Hamas wants is a
one-state solution but they want peace

4584
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:09,480
one-state solution but they want peace
 

4585
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:12,669
one-state solution but they want peace
all of them want peace um you know the

4586
01:48:12,669 --> 01:48:12,679
all of them want peace um you know the
 

4587
01:48:12,679 --> 01:48:15,270
all of them want peace um you know the
two different sets of leadership in

4588
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:15,280
two different sets of leadership in
 

4589
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,229
two different sets of leadership in
Palestine and the Israelis so you think

4590
01:48:17,229 --> 01:48:17,239
Palestine and the Israelis so you think
 

4591
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:20,270
Palestine and the Israelis so you think
Hamas wants peace sure but on its own

4592
01:48:20,270 --> 01:48:20,280
Hamas wants peace sure but on its own
 

4593
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:22,470
Hamas wants peace sure but on its own
terms that's the point what does peace

4594
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:22,480
terms that's the point what does peace
 

4595
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,750
terms that's the point what does peace
look like for Hamas at this point in

4596
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:24,760
look like for Hamas at this point in
 

4597
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:27,109
look like for Hamas at this point in
time I think peace basically means a

4598
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:27,119
time I think peace basically means a
 

4599
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:29,589
time I think peace basically means a
greater Israel controlled by Palestine

4600
01:48:29,589 --> 01:48:29,599
greater Israel controlled by Palestine
 

4601
01:48:29,599 --> 01:48:30,470
greater Israel controlled by Palestine
or

4602
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:30,480
or
 

4603
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:34,750
or
Palestinians okay so essentially I mean

4604
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:34,760
Palestinians okay so essentially I mean
 

4605
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,750
Palestinians okay so essentially I mean
it's the whole land is called Palestine

4606
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:36,760
it's the whole land is called Palestine
 

4607
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,229
it's the whole land is called Palestine
and there's no Israel I think at this

4608
01:48:39,229 --> 01:48:39,239
and there's no Israel I think at this
 

4609
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:40,790
and there's no Israel I think at this
point in time that's their principal

4610
01:48:40,790 --> 01:48:40,800
point in time that's their principal
 

4611
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:43,430
point in time that's their principal
goal I do believe and there have been

4612
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
goal I do believe and there have been
 

4613
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:45,550
goal I do believe and there have been
hints over time Jimmy Carter has said

4614
01:48:45,550 --> 01:48:45,560
hints over time Jimmy Carter has said
 

4615
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:48,790
hints over time Jimmy Carter has said
this that Hamas can be convinced that a

4616
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:48,800
this that Hamas can be convinced that a
 

4617
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,189
this that Hamas can be convinced that a
two-state solution assuming that the

4618
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
two-state solution assuming that the
 

4619
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:54,430
two-state solution assuming that the
Palestinians get a viable uh state of

4620
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:54,440
Palestinians get a viable uh state of
 

4621
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:57,310
Palestinians get a viable uh state of
their own that Hamas would buy into that

4622
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:57,320
their own that Hamas would buy into that
 

4623
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:59,470
their own that Hamas would buy into that
can we say that with a high degree of

4624
01:48:59,470 --> 01:48:59,480
can we say that with a high degree of
 

4625
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:01,870
can we say that with a high degree of
certainty no but I think I think the

4626
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:01,880
certainty no but I think I think the
 

4627
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:04,430
certainty no but I think I think the
Israelis should have pursued that

4628
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:04,440
Israelis should have pursued that
 

4629
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,030
Israelis should have pursued that
possibility they should have worked with

4630
01:49:06,030 --> 01:49:06,040
possibility they should have worked with
 

4631
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:08,229
possibility they should have worked with
abas they should have worked with Hamas

4632
01:49:08,229 --> 01:49:08,239
abas they should have worked with Hamas
 

4633
01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:10,629
abas they should have worked with Hamas
to do everything they can to facilitate

4634
01:49:10,629 --> 01:49:10,639
to do everything they can to facilitate
 

4635
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,910
to do everything they can to facilitate
a two-state solution because I think

4636
01:49:12,910 --> 01:49:12,920
a two-state solution because I think
 

4637
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:15,350
a two-state solution because I think
ultimately that's an Israel's interest

4638
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,360
ultimately that's an Israel's interest
 

4639
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,790
ultimately that's an Israel's interest
now the Israeli government and most

4640
01:49:17,790 --> 01:49:17,800
now the Israeli government and most
 

4641
01:49:17,800 --> 01:49:20,189
now the Israeli government and most
Israelis at this point in time I believe

4642
01:49:20,189 --> 01:49:20,199
Israelis at this point in time I believe
 

4643
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:22,470
Israelis at this point in time I believe
don't agree with that what do you think

4644
01:49:22,470 --> 01:49:22,480
don't agree with that what do you think
 

4645
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:26,589
don't agree with that what do you think

4646
01:49:26,589 --> 01:49:26,599
of Israel starting the ground invasion

allowed by the the United States to

01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,470
allowed by the the United States to
continue this

4666
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:53,480
continue this
 

4667
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:56,950
continue this
offensive uh for much more than a few

4668
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:56,960
offensive uh for much more than a few
 

4669
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,430
offensive uh for much more than a few
weeks um the Israelis have been saying

4670
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:00,440
weeks um the Israelis have been saying
 

4671
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:03,310
weeks um the Israelis have been saying
it would it's going to take in in the

4672
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:03,320
it would it's going to take in in the
 

4673
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:06,270
it would it's going to take in in the
best of all possible worlds a number of

4674
01:50:06,270 --> 01:50:06,280
best of all possible worlds a number of
 

4675
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:10,990
best of all possible worlds a number of
months if not a year to finish off Hamas

4676
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:11,000
months if not a year to finish off Hamas
 

4677
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,229
months if not a year to finish off Hamas
well it doesn't look like they're going

4678
01:50:12,229 --> 01:50:12,239
well it doesn't look like they're going
 

4679
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:16,070
well it doesn't look like they're going
to have enough time to do that I doubt

4680
01:50:16,070 --> 01:50:16,080
to have enough time to do that I doubt
 

4681
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:18,149
to have enough time to do that I doubt
whether they can finish off Hamas even

4682
01:50:18,149 --> 01:50:18,159
whether they can finish off Hamas even
 

4683
01:50:18,159 --> 01:50:20,750
whether they can finish off Hamas even
if they're given the time uh I think

4684
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:20,760
if they're given the time uh I think
 

4685
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:23,070
if they're given the time uh I think
they're going to run into Fierce

4686
01:50:23,070 --> 01:50:23,080
they're going to run into Fierce
 

4687
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:25,350
they're going to run into Fierce
resistance uh and when they run into

4688
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:25,360
resistance uh and when they run into
 

4689
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:27,149
resistance uh and when they run into
Fierce resistance and large numbers of

4690
01:50:27,149 --> 01:50:27,159
Fierce resistance and large numbers of
 

4691
01:50:27,159 --> 01:50:30,790
Fierce resistance and large numbers of
Israelis going to die start to die uh

4692
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:30,800
Israelis going to die start to die uh
 

4693
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:34,470
Israelis going to die start to die uh
they'll lose their appetite for this and

4694
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:34,480
they'll lose their appetite for this and
 

4695
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,189
they'll lose their appetite for this and
they the Israelis surely know at this

4696
01:50:37,189 --> 01:50:37,199
they the Israelis surely know at this
 

4697
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:38,950
they the Israelis surely know at this
point in time that even if they finish

4698
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
point in time that even if they finish
 

4699
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:41,109
point in time that even if they finish
off Hamas even if I'm wrong and they're

4700
01:50:41,109 --> 01:50:41,119
off Hamas even if I'm wrong and they're
 

4701
01:50:41,119 --> 01:50:43,750
off Hamas even if I'm wrong and they're
able to finish off Hamas another group

4702
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:43,760
able to finish off Hamas another group
 

4703
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:48,030
able to finish off Hamas another group
is going to rise up to uh resist the

4704
01:50:48,030 --> 01:50:48,040
is going to rise up to uh resist the
 

4705
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,470
is going to rise up to uh resist the
occupation the idea that you can use

4706
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:50,480
occupation the idea that you can use
 

4707
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:54,030
occupation the idea that you can use
what Z Yaba insky called The Iron Wall

4708
01:50:54,030 --> 01:50:54,040
what Z Yaba insky called The Iron Wall
 

4709
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:58,550
what Z Yaba insky called The Iron Wall
to beat the Palestinians into submission

4710
01:50:58,550 --> 01:50:58,560
to beat the Palestinians into submission
 

4711
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,550
to beat the Palestinians into submission
is delusional it's just not going to

4712
01:51:00,550 --> 01:51:00,560
is delusional it's just not going to
 

4713
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:03,629
is delusional it's just not going to
happen the Palestinians want a state of

4714
01:51:03,629 --> 01:51:03,639
happen the Palestinians want a state of
 

4715
01:51:03,639 --> 01:51:06,310
happen the Palestinians want a state of
their own they don't want to live under

their own they don't want to live under
 

4717
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:10,669
their own they don't want to live under
occupation and uh there's no military

4718
01:51:10,669 --> 01:51:10,679
occupation and uh there's no military
 

4719
01:51:10,679 --> 01:51:12,629
occupation and uh there's no military
solution for Israel here there has to be

4720
01:51:12,629 --> 01:51:12,639
solution for Israel here there has to be
 

4721
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:15,830
solution for Israel here there has to be
a political solution and the only viable

4722
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:15,840
a political solution and the only viable
 

4723
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,990
a political solution and the only viable
political solution is a two-state

4724
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:18,000
political solution is a two-state
 

4725
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,350
political solution is a two-state
solution I mean you can't go to

4726
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:20,360
solution I mean you can't go to
 

4727
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,709
solution I mean you can't go to
democracy you can't go to a situation

4728
01:51:22,709 --> 01:51:22,719
democracy you can't go to a situation
 

4729
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:24,950
democracy you can't go to a situation
where you give the Palestinians equal

4730
01:51:24,950 --> 01:51:24,960
where you give the Palestinians equal
 

4731
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,709
where you give the Palestinians equal
rights inside a greater Israel in large

4732
01:51:27,709 --> 01:51:27,719
rights inside a greater Israel in large
 

4733
01:51:27,719 --> 01:51:29,629
rights inside a greater Israel in large
part because there are

4734
01:51:29,629 --> 01:51:29,639
part because there are
 

4735
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:33,149
part because there are
now as many Palestinians as there are

4736
01:51:33,149 --> 01:51:33,159
now as many Palestinians as there are
 

4737
01:51:33,159 --> 01:51:35,870
now as many Palestinians as there are
Israeli Jews and over time the balance

4738
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:35,880
Israeli Jews and over time the balance
 

4739
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:38,669
Israeli Jews and over time the balance
the demographic balance shifts against

4740
01:51:38,669 --> 01:51:38,679
the demographic balance shifts against
 

4741
01:51:38,679 --> 01:51:40,870
the demographic balance shifts against
the Israeli Jews and in favor of the

4742
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:40,880
the Israeli Jews and in favor of the
 

4743
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:43,149
the Israeli Jews and in favor of the
Palestinians in which case you'll end up

4744
01:51:43,149 --> 01:51:43,159
Palestinians in which case you'll end up
 

4745
01:51:43,159 --> 01:51:45,390
Palestinians in which case you'll end up
with a Palestinian state in Greater

4746
01:51:45,390 --> 01:51:45,400
with a Palestinian state in Greater
 

4747
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:50,109
with a Palestinian state in Greater
Israel so you know democracy for all

4748
01:51:50,109 --> 01:51:50,119
Israel so you know democracy for all
 

4749
01:51:50,119 --> 01:51:53,550
Israel so you know democracy for all
doesn't work uh the Israelis I believe

4750
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:53,560
doesn't work uh the Israelis I believe
 

4751
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:56,229
doesn't work uh the Israelis I believe
are quite interested in ethnic cleansing

4752
01:51:56,229 --> 01:51:56,239
are quite interested in ethnic cleansing
 

4753
01:51:56,239 --> 01:52:00,870
are quite interested in ethnic cleansing
I think they saw this um uh this recent

4754
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:00,880
I think they saw this um uh this recent
 

4755
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:02,669
I think they saw this um uh this recent
set of events as an opportunity to

4756
01:52:02,669 --> 01:52:02,679
set of events as an opportunity to
 

4757
01:52:02,679 --> 01:52:04,870
set of events as an opportunity to
cleanse Gaza but that's not going to

4758
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:04,880
cleanse Gaza but that's not going to
 

4759
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,229
cleanse Gaza but that's not going to
happen uh the jordanians and the

4760
01:52:07,229 --> 01:52:07,239
happen uh the jordanians and the
 

4761
01:52:07,239 --> 01:52:09,589
happen uh the jordanians and the
Egyptians have made it clear that that's

4762
01:52:09,589 --> 01:52:09,599
Egyptians have made it clear that that's
 

4763
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:12,069
Egyptians have made it clear that that's
not happening the United States has now

4764
01:52:12,069 --> 01:52:12,079
not happening the United States has now
 

4765
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:14,830
not happening the United States has now
made it clear that that's not happening

4766
01:52:14,830 --> 01:52:14,840
made it clear that that's not happening
 

4767
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:18,109
made it clear that that's not happening
and and the Palestinians will not leave

4768
01:52:18,109 --> 01:52:18,119
and and the Palestinians will not leave
 

4769
01:52:18,119 --> 01:52:20,470
and and the Palestinians will not leave
uh they'll die in place

4770
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:20,480
uh they'll die in place
 

4771
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,669
uh they'll die in place
uh so uh ethnic cleansing doesn't work

4772
01:52:23,669 --> 01:52:23,679
uh so uh ethnic cleansing doesn't work
 

4773
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:24,910
uh so uh ethnic cleansing doesn't work
so you're really left with two

4774
01:52:24,910 --> 01:52:24,920
so you're really left with two
 

4775
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:27,390
so you're really left with two
Alternatives a two-state solution or a

4776
01:52:27,390 --> 01:52:27,400
Alternatives a two-state solution or a
 

4777
01:52:27,400 --> 01:52:30,430
Alternatives a two-state solution or a
greater Israel that is effectively an

01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:30,440
greater Israel that is effectively an
 

4779
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:32,390
greater Israel that is effectively an
apartheid state I mean that's what the

4780
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:32,400
apartheid state I mean that's what the
 

4781
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,149
apartheid state I mean that's what the
occupation has led to and all sorts of

4782
01:52:35,149 --> 01:52:35,159

4783
01:52:35,159 --> 01:52:37,229

01:52:37,229 --> 01:52:37,239
people have been predicting this for a
 

4785
01:52:37,239 --> 01:52:40,149
people have been predicting this for a
long long time and you've now reached

4786
01:52:40,149 --> 01:52:40,159
long long time and you've now reached
 

4787
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:42,510
long long time and you've now reached
the point you know here in the United

the point you know here in the United

into all sorts of trouble but the fact

for Israel in my opinion and Steve Walt

4820
01:53:25,069 --> 01:53:25,079
for Israel in my opinion and Steve Walt
 

4821
01:53:25,079 --> 01:53:26,830
for Israel in my opinion and Steve Walt
and I said this by the way when we wrote

4822
01:53:26,830 --> 01:53:26,840
and I said this by the way when we wrote
 

4823
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:29,430
and I said this by the way when we wrote
the Israel Lobby that Israel is an

4824
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:29,440
the Israel Lobby that Israel is an
 

4825
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:32,270
the Israel Lobby that Israel is an
aparte state which is equivalent to

4826
01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:32,280
aparte state which is equivalent to
 

4827
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:36,510
aparte state which is equivalent to
Israel as an occupier uh is not good for

01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:36,520
Israel as an occupier uh is not good for
 

4829
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:39,109
Israel as an occupier uh is not good for
Israel uh and that brings us back to the

4830
01:53:39,109 --> 01:53:39,119
Israel uh and that brings us back to the
 

4831
01:53:39,119 --> 01:53:41,589
Israel uh and that brings us back to the
two-state solution but as you and I were

4832
01:53:41,589 --> 01:53:41,599
two-state solution but as you and I were
 

4833
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:43,790
two-state solution but as you and I were
talking about a few minutes ago it's

4834

talking about a few minutes ago it's
 

4835
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:47,430
talking about a few minutes ago it's
hard to see how you get a two-state

4836
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:47,440
hard to see how you get a two-state
 

4837
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:50,069
hard to see how you get a two-state
solution and the end result of this

4838
01:53:50,069 --> 01:53:50,079
solution and the end result of this
 

4839
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:52,669
solution and the end result of this
conversation is utter

4840
01:53:52,669 --> 01:53:52,679
conversation is utter
 

4841
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:55,390
conversation is utter
despair because the path to a two-state

4842
01:53:55,390 --> 01:53:55,400
despair because the path to a two-state
 

4843
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:59,189
despair because the path to a two-state
solution is blocked by the amount of um

4844
01:53:59,189 --> 01:53:59,199
solution is blocked by the amount of um
 

4845
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:01,470
solution is blocked by the amount of um
hate that's created by civilian deaths

4846
01:54:01,470 --> 01:54:01,480
hate that's created by civilian deaths
 

4847
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:03,629
hate that's created by civilian deaths
well that plus the fact that the Israeli

interested in getting Israel excuse me
getting the United States and here we're

01:57:24,550 --> 01:57:24,560
getting the United States and here we're
 

5003
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:25,990
getting the United States and here we're
talking mainly about the American

5004

what Israel does and our argument is

01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:32,440
what Israel does and our argument is
 

5009
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:34,189
what Israel does and our argument is
that if you look at the relationship

5010
01:57:34,189 --> 01:57:34,199
that if you look at the relationship
 

5011
01:57:34,199 --> 01:57:37,109
that if you look at the relationship
between the United States and Israel

5012
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119

01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:44,350
it's unprecedented in modern history uh
this is the closest relationship that

5016
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:44,360
this is the closest relationship that
 

5017
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:48,629
this is the closest relationship that
you can find between any two countries

5018
01:57:48,629 --> 01:57:48,639
you can find between any two countries
 

5019
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:53,030
you can find between any two countries
in recorded history it's truly amazing

5020
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,040
in recorded history it's truly amazing
 

5021
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,069
in recorded history it's truly amazing
the extent to which Israel and the

5022
01:57:55,069 --> 01:57:55,079
the extent to which Israel and the
 

5023
01:57:55,079 --> 01:57:57,870
the extent to which Israel and the
United States are joined at the hip and

5024
01:57:57,870 --> 01:57:57,880
United States are joined at the hip and
 

5025
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:02,030
United States are joined at the hip and
we support Israel no matter what almost

5026
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:02,040
we support Israel no matter what almost
 

5027
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:06,550
we support Israel no matter what almost
all the time uh and uh our argument is

5028
01:58:06,550 --> 01:58:06,560
all the time uh and uh our argument is
 

5029
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:08,870
all the time uh and uh our argument is
that that is largely due to the

5030
01:58:08,870 --> 01:58:08,880
that that is largely due to the
 

5031
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:12,550
that that is largely due to the
influence of the lobby the lobby is uh

5032

influence of the lobby the lobby is uh
 

5033
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:15,910
influence of the lobby the lobby is uh
an extremely powerful interest group now

5034
01:58:15,910 --> 01:58:15,920
an extremely powerful interest group now
 

5035
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:18,589
an extremely powerful interest group now
it's very important to understand that

5036
01:58:18,589 --> 01:58:18,599
it's very important to understand that
 

5037
01:58:18,599 --> 01:58:21,910
it's very important to understand that
the American political system is set up

5038
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:21,920
the American political system is set up
 

5039
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,790
the American political system is set up
in ways that allow interest groups of

5040
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:25,800
in ways that allow interest groups of
 

5041
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:29,870
in ways that allow interest groups of
All Sorts to wield great influence so in

5042
01:58:29,870 --> 01:58:29,880
All Sorts to wield great influence so in
 

5043
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,950
All Sorts to wield great influence so in
the United States you have an interest

5044
01:58:31,950 --> 01:58:31,960
the United States you have an interest
 

5045
01:58:31,960 --> 01:58:35,189
the United States you have an interest
group or a Lobby like the National Rifle

5046
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:35,199
group or a Lobby like the National Rifle
 

5047
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:37,830
group or a Lobby like the National Rifle
Association that makes it well nigh

5048
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:37,840
Association that makes it well nigh
 

5049
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:41,870
Association that makes it well nigh
impossible to get gun control right uh

5050
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:41,880
impossible to get gun control right uh
 

5051
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:45,950
impossible to get gun control right uh
and so with the Israel Lobby you have

5052
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:45,960
and so with the Israel Lobby you have
 

5053
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:49,270
and so with the Israel Lobby you have
this group of individuals and organ

5054
01:58:49,270 --> 01:58:49,280
this group of individuals and organ
 

5055
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:52,229
this group of individuals and organ
organizations that wield enormous

5056
01:58:52,229 --> 01:58:52,239
organizations that wield enormous
 

5057
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:54,709
organizations that wield enormous
influence on US policy toward the Middle

5058
01:58:54,709 --> 01:58:54,719
influence on US policy toward the Middle
 

5059
01:58:54,719 --> 01:58:57,270
influence on US policy toward the Middle
East and this

5060
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:57,280
East and this
 

5061
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:01,510
East and this
is not surprising given the nature of

5062
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:01,520
is not surprising given the nature of
 

5063
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:04,790
is not surprising given the nature of
the American political system uh so our

5064
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:04,800
the American political system uh so our
 

5065
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:07,390
the American political system uh so our
argument is that the lobby is not doing

5066
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:07,400
argument is that the lobby is not doing
 

5067
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:11,550
argument is that the lobby is not doing
anything that's illegal or illicit or

5068
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:11,560
anything that's illegal or illicit or
 

5069
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:15,470
anything that's illegal or illicit or
immoral or unethical it's just a good

5070
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:15,480
immoral or unethical it's just a good
 

5071
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:18,870
immoral or unethical it's just a good
old-fashioned American interest group

5072
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:18,880
old-fashioned American interest group
 

5073
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,229
old-fashioned American interest group
and it just happens to be extremely

5074
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:22,239
and it just happens to be extremely
 

5075
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:25,910
and it just happens to be extremely
powerful and our argument is that this

5076
01:59:25,910 --> 01:59:25,920
powerful and our argument is that this
 

5077
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:28,470
powerful and our argument is that this
is not good for the United States

5078
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:28,480
is not good for the United States
 

5079
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:31,350
is not good for the United States
because no two countries have the same

5080
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:31,360
because no two countries have the same
 

5081
01:59:31,360 --> 01:59:34,430
because no two countries have the same
interests all the time and when our

5082
01:59:34,430 --> 01:59:34,440
interests all the time and when our
 

5083
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:36,310
interests all the time and when our
interests conflict with Israel's

5084
01:59:36,310 --> 01:59:36,320
interests conflict with Israel's
 

5085
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,790
interests conflict with Israel's
interest we should be able to do what we

5086
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:38,800
interest we should be able to do what we
 

5087
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,750
interest we should be able to do what we
think is in our national interest in

5088
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:40,760
think is in our national interest in
 

5089
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:43,030
think is in our national interest in
America's national interest but the

5090
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:43,040
America's national interest but the
 

5091
01:59:43,040 --> 01:59:45,550
America's national interest but the
lobby tends to conflate America's

5092
01:59:45,550 --> 01:59:45,560
lobby tends to conflate America's
 

5093
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:47,189
lobby tends to conflate America's
national interests with Israel's

5094
01:59:47,189 --> 01:59:47,199
national interests with Israel's
 

5095
01:59:47,199 --> 01:59:49,830
national interests with Israel's
national interests and wants the United

5096
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:49,840
national interests and wants the United
 

5097
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:53,229
national interests and wants the United
States to support Israel no matter what

5098
01:59:53,229 --> 01:59:53,239
States to support Israel no matter what
 

5099
01:59:53,239 --> 01:59:55,669
States to support Israel no matter what
we also argue and I cannot emphasize

5100
01:59:55,669 --> 01:59:55,679
we also argue and I cannot emphasize
 

5101
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:57,470
we also argue and I cannot emphasize
this enough given what's going on in the

5102
01:59:57,470 --> 01:59:57,480
this enough given what's going on in the
 

5103
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:00,109
this enough given what's going on in the
world today that the

5104
02:00:00,109 --> 02:00:00,119
world today that the
 

5105
02:00:00,119 --> 02:00:04,229
world today that the
Lobby's effects the lobby has not

5106
02:00:04,229 --> 02:00:04,239
Lobby's effects the lobby has not
 

5107
02:00:04,239 --> 02:00:07,430
Lobby's effects the lobby has not
been pushing policies that are in

5108
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:07,440
been pushing policies that are in
 

5109
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,830
been pushing policies that are in
Israel's interest so our argument is

5110
02:00:09,830 --> 02:00:09,840
Israel's interest so our argument is
 

5111
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:13,750
Israel's interest so our argument is
that the lobby right the lobby pushes

5112
02:00:13,750 --> 02:00:13,760
that the lobby right the lobby pushes
 

5113
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:15,750
that the lobby right the lobby pushes
policies that are not in America's

5114
02:00:15,750 --> 02:00:15,760
policies that are not in America's
 

5115
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:18,709
policies that are not in America's
interest or not in Israel's interest now

5116
02:00:18,709 --> 02:00:18,719
interest or not in Israel's interest now
 

5117
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:20,350
interest or not in Israel's interest now
you're saying yourself what exactly does

5118
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:20,360
you're saying yourself what exactly does
 

5119
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:21,709
you're saying yourself what exactly does
he mean by

5120
02:00:21,709 --> 02:00:21,719
he mean by
 

5121
02:00:21,719 --> 02:00:24,550
he mean by
that what every president since Jimmy

5122
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:24,560
that what every president since Jimmy
 

5123
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:27,510
that what every president since Jimmy
Carter has tried to do as I said before

5124
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:27,520
Carter has tried to do as I said before
 

5125
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:30,390
Carter has tried to do as I said before
is to foster a two-state solution to

5126
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:30,400
is to foster a two-state solution to
 

5127
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:34,229
is to foster a two-state solution to
push Israel which is the dominant

5128
02:00:34,229 --> 02:00:34,239
push Israel which is the dominant
 

5129
02:00:34,239 --> 02:00:38,109
push Israel which is the dominant
player in Greater Israel push Israel to

5130
02:00:38,109 --> 02:00:38,119
player in Greater Israel push Israel to
 

5131
02:00:38,119 --> 02:00:41,790
player in Greater Israel push Israel to
accept the two-state solution and we

5132
02:00:41,790 --> 02:00:41,800
accept the two-state solution and we
 

5133
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:45,390
accept the two-state solution and we
have run into huge resistance from the

5134
02:00:45,390 --> 02:00:45,400
have run into huge resistance from the
 

5135
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:48,310
have run into huge resistance from the
lobby whenever we tried to let's be

5136
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:48,320
lobby whenever we tried to let's be
 

5137
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:51,430
lobby whenever we tried to let's be
blunt about it course Israel right in a

5138
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:51,440
blunt about it course Israel right in a
 

5139
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,350
blunt about it course Israel right in a
perfect world where there was no Lobby

5140
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:53,360
perfect world where there was no Lobby
 

5141
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:56,709
perfect world where there was no Lobby
and an American president was free to

5142
02:00:56,709 --> 02:00:56,719
and an American president was free to
 

5143
02:00:56,719 --> 02:00:59,430
and an American president was free to
put pressure on Israel to coers Israel I

5144
02:00:59,430 --> 02:00:59,440
put pressure on Israel to coers Israel I
 

5145
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,510
put pressure on Israel to coers Israel I
believe we would have gone a long way

5146
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:01,520
believe we would have gone a long way
 

5147
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:04,950
believe we would have gone a long way
towards getting two-state solution and I

5148
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:04,960
towards getting two-state solution and I
 

5149
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:07,910
towards getting two-state solution and I
believe this would have been in Israel's

5150
02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:07,920
believe this would have been in Israel's
 

5151
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,910
believe this would have been in Israel's
interest uh but we couldn't get a

5152
02:01:09,910 --> 02:01:09,920
interest uh but we couldn't get a
 

5153
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:12,350
interest uh but we couldn't get a
two-state solution because it was almost

5154
02:01:12,350 --> 02:01:12,360
two-state solution because it was almost
 

5155
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:14,629
two-state solution because it was almost
impossible to put meaningful pressure on

5156
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
impossible to put meaningful pressure on
 

5157
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:18,270
impossible to put meaningful pressure on
Israel because of the lobby so this was

5158
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:18,280
Israel because of the lobby so this was
 

5159
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:20,510
Israel because of the lobby so this was
not an Israel's interest and it was not

5160
02:01:20,510 --> 02:01:20,520
not an Israel's interest and it was not
 

5161
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:22,629
not an Israel's interest and it was not
in America's interest and that was the

5162
02:01:22,629 --> 02:01:22,639
in America's interest and that was the
 

5163
02:01:22,639 --> 02:01:25,390
in America's interest and that was the
argument that we made and uh we of

5164
02:01:25,390 --> 02:01:25,400
argument that we made and uh we of
 

5165
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:28,149
argument that we made and uh we of
course got huge pushback for making that

5166
02:01:28,149 --> 02:01:28,159
course got huge pushback for making that
 

5167
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:29,669
course got huge pushback for making that
argument what's the underlying

5168
02:01:29,669 --> 02:01:29,679
argument what's the underlying
 

5169
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:31,790
argument what's the underlying
motivation of the lobby is it religious

5170
02:01:31,790 --> 02:01:31,800
motivation of the lobby is it religious
 

5171
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:35,510
motivation of the lobby is it religious
in nature is it um similar to the way

5172
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:35,520
in nature is it um similar to the way
 

5173
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,510
in nature is it um similar to the way
warhawks are sort of militaristic in

5174
02:01:38,510 --> 02:01:38,520
warhawks are sort of militaristic in
 

5175
02:01:38,520 --> 02:01:40,629
warhawks are sort of militaristic in
nature is it nationalistic in nature

5176
02:01:40,629 --> 02:01:40,639
nature is it nationalistic in nature
 

5177
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:43,550
nature is it nationalistic in nature
what what's uh if you were describe this

5178
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:43,560
what what's uh if you were describe this
 

5179
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,310
what what's uh if you were describe this
loose Coalition of people what what

5180
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:45,320
loose Coalition of people what what
 

5181
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:47,709
loose Coalition of people what what
would you say is their motivation well

5182
02:01:47,709 --> 02:01:47,719
would you say is their motivation well
 

5183
02:01:47,719 --> 02:01:48,589
would you say is their motivation well
first of all I think you have to

5184
02:01:48,589 --> 02:01:48,599
first of all I think you have to
 

5185
02:01:48,599 --> 02:01:51,350
first of all I think you have to
distinguish between Jews and Christians

5186
02:01:51,350 --> 02:01:51,360
distinguish between Jews and Christians
 

5187
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,470
distinguish between Jews and Christians
you want to remember that there are a

5188
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:53,480
you want to remember that there are a
 

5189
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,990
you want to remember that there are a
huge number of Christian zionists who

5190
02:01:55,990 --> 02:01:56,000
huge number of Christian zionists who
 

5191
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,310
huge number of Christian zionists who
are deeply committed to Israel no matter

5192
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:58,320
are deeply committed to Israel no matter
 

5193
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:01,350
are deeply committed to Israel no matter
what right and then there are a large

5194
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:01,360
what right and then there are a large
 

5195
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:03,310
what right and then there are a large
number of Jews the Jews are obviously

5196
02:02:03,310 --> 02:02:03,320
number of Jews the Jews are obviously
 

5197
02:02:03,320 --> 02:02:06,030
number of Jews the Jews are obviously
the most important of those two groups

5198
02:02:06,030 --> 02:02:06,040
the most important of those two groups
 

5199
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:07,990
the most important of those two groups
in the Israel lobby but you know one of

5200
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:08,000
in the Israel lobby but you know one of
 

5201
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,310
in the Israel lobby but you know one of
the arguments that we made in the book

5202
02:02:11,310 --> 02:02:11,320
the arguments that we made in the book
 

5203
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,229
the arguments that we made in the book
is that you should not call it the

5204
02:02:13,229 --> 02:02:13,239
is that you should not call it the
 

5205
02:02:13,239 --> 02:02:16,589
is that you should not call it the
Jewish Lobby because it's not populated

5206
02:02:16,589 --> 02:02:16,599
Jewish Lobby because it's not populated
 

5207
02:02:16,599 --> 02:02:19,109
Jewish Lobby because it's not populated
just by Jews and Christians ey in this

5208
02:02:19,109 --> 02:02:19,119
just by Jews and Christians ey in this
 

5209
02:02:19,119 --> 02:02:22,750
just by Jews and Christians ey in this
are an important part of that lobby but

5210
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:22,760
are an important part of that lobby but
 

5211
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:25,109
are an important part of that lobby but
furthermore there are a good number of

5212
02:02:25,109 --> 02:02:25,119
furthermore there are a good number of
 

5213
02:02:25,119 --> 02:02:29,229
furthermore there are a good number of
Jews who are opposed to the lobby uh and

5214
02:02:29,229 --> 02:02:29,239
Jews who are opposed to the lobby uh and
 

5215
02:02:29,239 --> 02:02:31,950
Jews who are opposed to the lobby uh and
the policies that the lobby purveys and

5216
02:02:31,950 --> 02:02:31,960
the policies that the lobby purveys and
 

5217
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:36,629
the policies that the lobby purveys and
there are uh a number of Jews who are

5218
02:02:36,629 --> 02:02:36,639
there are uh a number of Jews who are
 

5219
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:38,030
there are uh a number of Jews who are
prominent

5220
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:38,040
prominent
 

5221
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:39,990
prominent
anti-zionists right so and they're

5222
02:02:39,990 --> 02:02:40,000
anti-zionists right so and they're
 

5223
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,910
anti-zionists right so and they're
obviously not in the lobby or or if you

5224
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:42,920
obviously not in the lobby or or if you
 

5225
02:02:42,920 --> 02:02:45,470
obviously not in the lobby or or if you
take a group like Jewish voice for peace

5226
02:02:45,470 --> 02:02:45,480
take a group like Jewish voice for peace
 

5227
02:02:45,480 --> 02:02:47,510
take a group like Jewish voice for peace
right Jewish voice for peace is not in

5228
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:47,520
right Jewish voice for peace is not in
 

5229
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:49,589
right Jewish voice for peace is not in
the lobby so

5230
02:02:49,589 --> 02:02:49,599
the lobby so
 

5231
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:52,390
the lobby so
it's wrong to call it a Jewish lobby but

5232
02:02:52,390 --> 02:02:52,400
it's wrong to call it a Jewish lobby but
 

5233
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:56,229
it's wrong to call it a Jewish lobby but
with regard to the American Jews who

5234
02:02:56,229 --> 02:02:56,239
with regard to the American Jews who
 

5235
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:59,790
with regard to the American Jews who
were in that Lobby uh I I think that

5236
02:02:59,790 --> 02:02:59,800
were in that Lobby uh I I think that
 

5237
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:02,750
were in that Lobby uh I I think that
really this is all about nationalism

5238
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:02,760
really this is all about nationalism
 

5239
02:03:02,760 --> 02:03:04,629
really this is all about nationalism
it's not so much religion many of those

5240
02:03:04,629 --> 02:03:04,639
it's not so much religion many of those
 

5241
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:07,830
it's not so much religion many of those
Jews who are influential in the lobby

5242
02:03:07,830 --> 02:03:07,840
Jews who are influential in the lobby
 

5243
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,750
Jews who are influential in the lobby
are not religious in any meaningful

5244
02:03:09,750 --> 02:03:09,760
are not religious in any meaningful
 

5245
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:11,669
are not religious in any meaningful
sense of that term but they

5246
02:03:11,669 --> 02:03:11,679
sense of that term but they
 

5247
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:14,709
sense of that term but they
self-identify as Jewish in in in the

5248
02:03:14,709 --> 02:03:14,719
self-identify as Jewish in in in the
 

5249
02:03:14,719 --> 02:03:16,310
self-identify as Jewish in in in the
sense that they feel they're part of a

5250
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:16,320
sense that they feel they're part of a
 

5251
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:19,510
sense that they feel they're part of a
Jewish nation and that that in addition

5252
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:19,520
Jewish nation and that that in addition
 

5253
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,589
Jewish nation and that that in addition
to being an American right they are part

5254
02:03:22,589 --> 02:03:22,599
to being an American right they are part
 

5255
02:03:22,599 --> 02:03:25,750
to being an American right they are part
of this tribe this nation called Jews

5256
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:25,760
of this tribe this nation called Jews
 

5257
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,830
of this tribe this nation called Jews
and that they have a

5258
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:27,840
and that they have a
 

5259
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:30,950
and that they have a
responsibility um to push the United

5260
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:30,960
responsibility um to push the United
 

5261
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,510
responsibility um to push the United
States in ways that support uh the

5262
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:34,520
States in ways that support uh the
 

5263
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:37,669
States in ways that support uh the
Jewish state so I I think that's what

5264
02:03:37,669 --> 02:03:37,679
Jewish state so I I think that's what
 

5265
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,990
Jewish state so I I think that's what
drives most if not almost all the Jews

5266
02:03:40,990 --> 02:03:41,000
drives most if not almost all the Jews
 

5267
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,270
drives most if not almost all the Jews
this is not to say there's not a

5268
02:03:42,270 --> 02:03:42,280
this is not to say there's not a
 

5269
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:44,629
this is not to say there's not a
religious dimension for some of them but

5270
02:03:44,629 --> 02:03:44,639
religious dimension for some of them but
 

5271
02:03:44,639 --> 02:03:46,990
religious dimension for some of them but
I think that the the main connection is

5272
02:03:46,990 --> 02:03:47,000
I think that the the main connection is
 

5273
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,669
I think that the the main connection is
much more tribal in nature

5274
02:03:49,669 --> 02:03:49,679
much more tribal in nature
 

5275
02:03:49,679 --> 02:03:51,669
much more tribal in nature
so I had a conversation with Benjamin

5276
02:03:51,669 --> 02:03:51,679
so I had a conversation with Benjamin
 

5277
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:53,910
so I had a conversation with Benjamin
Netanyahu and he said fundamentally if

5278
02:03:53,910 --> 02:03:53,920
Netanyahu and he said fundamentally if
 

5279
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:57,669
Netanyahu and he said fundamentally if
you're anti-zionist you're

5280
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
you're anti-zionist you're
 

5281
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:01,790
you're anti-zionist you're
anti-semitic so the the the Zionist

5282
02:04:01,790 --> 02:04:01,800
anti-semitic so the the the Zionist
 

5283
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:05,669
anti-semitic so the the the Zionist
project is tied at the hip to the Jewish

5284
02:04:05,669 --> 02:04:05,679
project is tied at the hip to the Jewish
 

5285
02:04:05,679 --> 02:04:08,910
project is tied at the hip to the Jewish
project what do you have to say to that

5286
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:08,920
project what do you have to say to that
 

5287
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:12,069
project what do you have to say to that
look you can Define

5288
02:04:12,069 --> 02:04:12,079
look you can Define
 

5289
02:04:12,079 --> 02:04:16,589
look you can Define
anti-Semitism any way you want right and

5290
02:04:16,589 --> 02:04:16,599
anti-Semitism any way you want right and
 

5291
02:04:16,599 --> 02:04:20,149
anti-Semitism any way you want right and
you can Define anti an semitism to

5292
02:04:20,149 --> 02:04:20,159
you can Define anti an semitism to
 

5293
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:23,390
you can Define anti an semitism to
incorporate anti-zionism

5294
02:04:23,390 --> 02:04:23,400
incorporate anti-zionism
 

5295
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:27,589
incorporate anti-zionism
uh and uh I think we have reached the

5296
02:04:27,589 --> 02:04:27,599
uh and uh I think we have reached the
 

5297
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:29,750
uh and uh I think we have reached the
point where

5298
02:04:29,750 --> 02:04:29,760
point where
 

5299
02:04:29,760 --> 02:04:33,350
point where
anti-Semitism is identified today not

5300
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:33,360
anti-Semitism is identified today not
 

5301
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:35,350
anti-Semitism is identified today not
just with anti-zionism but with

5302
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:35,360
just with anti-zionism but with
 

5303
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:38,430
just with anti-zionism but with
criticism of Israel if you criticize

5304
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:38,440
criticism of Israel if you criticize
 

5305
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:40,870
criticism of Israel if you criticize
Israel people will say some people will

5306
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:40,880
Israel people will say some people will
 

5307
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:42,030
Israel people will say some people will
say you're an

5308
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:42,040
say you're an
 

5309
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:44,589
say you're an
anti-semite and if that's your

5310
02:04:44,589 --> 02:04:44,599
anti-semite and if that's your
 

5311
02:04:44,599 --> 02:04:46,549
anti-semite and if that's your
definition of

5312
02:04:46,549 --> 02:04:46,559
definition of
 

5313
02:04:46,559 --> 02:04:50,910
definition of
anti-semitism it's taken an important

5314
02:04:50,910 --> 02:04:50,920
anti-semitism it's taken an important
 

5315
02:04:50,920 --> 02:04:54,669
anti-semitism it's taken an important
term and stretched it to the point where

5316
02:04:54,669 --> 02:04:54,679
term and stretched it to the point where
 

5317
02:04:54,679 --> 02:04:55,510
term and stretched it to the point where
it's

5318
02:04:55,510 --> 02:04:55,520
it's
 

5319
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:58,030
it's
meaningless right so when Steve and I

5320
02:04:58,030 --> 02:04:58,040
meaningless right so when Steve and I
 

5321
02:04:58,040 --> 02:05:01,470
meaningless right so when Steve and I
wrote the book uh wrote the article and

02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:01,480
wrote the book uh wrote the article and

5345
02:05:27,800 --> 02:05:29,430

about these issues uh way back
 

5597
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:13,870
about these issues uh way back
when it would have gone a long way

when it would have gone a long way
 

5599
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:17,189
when it would have gone a long way
towards uh you know maybe getting a

5600
02:11:17,189 --> 02:11:17,199
towards uh you know maybe getting a
 

5601
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:18,669
towards uh you know maybe getting a
two-state solution

5602
02:11:18,669 --> 02:11:18,679
two-state solution
 

5603
02:11:18,679 --> 02:11:20,830
two-state solution
which I think was the best alternative

5604
02:11:20,830 --> 02:11:20,840
which I think was the best alternative
 

5605
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:23,310
which I think was the best alternative
here it it's complicated and I I wonder

5606
02:11:23,310 --> 02:11:23,320
here it it's complicated and I I wonder
 

5607
02:11:23,320 --> 02:11:26,350
here it it's complicated and I I wonder
if you can comment on the complexity of

5608
02:11:26,350 --> 02:11:26,360
if you can comment on the complexity of
 

5609
02:11:26,360 --> 02:11:29,510
if you can comment on the complexity of
this because criticizing Israel and you

5610

know criticizing the
lobby can

5614
02:11:34,149 --> 02:11:34,159
lobby can
 

5615
02:11:34,159 --> 02:11:38,149
lobby can
um for a lot of people be a dog whistle

5616
02:11:38,149 --> 02:11:38,159
um for a lot of people be a dog whistle
 

5617
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:42,229
um for a lot of people be a dog whistle
for sort of anti-Semitic conspiracy

5618
02:11:42,229 --> 02:11:42,239
for sort of anti-Semitic conspiracy
 

5619
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:45,189
for sort of anti-Semitic conspiracy
theories that you know this idea that

5620
02:11:45,189 --> 02:11:45,199
theories that you know this idea that
 

5621
02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:47,350
theories that you know this idea that
Jews run everything run the world or

5622
02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:47,360
Jews run everything run the world or
 

5623
02:11:47,360 --> 02:11:49,430
Jews run everything run the world or
this kind of

5624
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:49,440
this kind of
 

5625
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:52,990
this kind of
cabal and you know

5626
02:11:52,990 --> 02:11:53,000
cabal and you know
 

5627
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,589
cabal and you know
it's it's also very true that people who

5628
02:11:55,589 --> 02:11:55,599
it's it's also very true that people who
 

5629
02:11:55,599 --> 02:11:57,229
it's it's also very true that people who
are legitimately

5630
02:11:57,229 --> 02:11:57,239
are legitimately
 

5631
02:11:57,239 --> 02:11:59,750
are legitimately
anti-semitic are also critics of Israel

5632
02:11:59,750 --> 02:11:59,760
anti-semitic are also critics of Israel
 

5633
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,109
anti-semitic are also critics of Israel
in the same kind of way and so it's such

5634
02:12:02,109 --> 02:12:02,119
in the same kind of way and so it's such
 

5635
02:12:02,119 --> 02:12:05,669
in the same kind of way and so it's such
a complicated landscape in which to have

5636
02:12:05,669 --> 02:12:05,679
a complicated landscape in which to have
 

5637

Israel it's not good for the United
 

5813
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,950
Israel it's not good for the United
States and I would argue in the end if

5814
02:16:19,950 --> 02:16:19,960
States and I would argue in the end if
 

5815
02:16:19,960 --> 02:16:21,510
States and I would argue in the end if
anything it's going to Foster

5816
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:21,520
anything it's going to Foster
 

5817
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:23,669
anything it's going to Foster
anti-Semitism I think you don't want to

5818
02:16:23,669 --> 02:16:23,679
anti-Semitism I think you don't want to
 

5819
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:26,229
anti-Semitism I think you don't want to
run around telling people that they

5820
02:16:26,229 --> 02:16:26,239
run around telling people that they
 

5821
02:16:26,239 --> 02:16:29,470
run around telling people that they
can't talk about Israel without being

5822
02:16:29,470 --> 02:16:29,480
can't talk about Israel without being
 

5823
02:16:29,480 --> 02:16:31,990
can't talk about Israel without being
called an anti-semite it's just not it's

5824
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:32,000
called an anti-semite it's just not it's
 

5825
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,870
called an anti-semite it's just not it's
not healthy uh in terms of the issue

5826
02:16:34,870 --> 02:16:34,880
not healthy uh in terms of the issue
 

5827
02:16:34,880 --> 02:16:38,469
not healthy uh in terms of the issue
that you're raising right but I still

5828
02:16:38,469 --> 02:16:38,479
that you're raising right but I still
 

5829
02:16:38,479 --> 02:16:41,230
that you're raising right but I still
agree with you that it is a tricky issue

5830
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:41,240
agree with you that it is a tricky issue
 

5831
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:43,790
agree with you that it is a tricky issue
it's I I don't want to make light of

5832
02:16:43,790 --> 02:16:43,800
it's I I don't want to make light of
 

5833
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:47,070
it's I I don't want to make light of
that you know I know that there's this

5834
02:16:47,070 --> 02:16:47,080
that you know I know that there's this
 

5835
02:16:47,080 --> 02:16:48,870
that you know I know that there's this
piece of liter out there called the

5836
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:48,880
piece of liter out there called the
 

5837
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:52,030
piece of liter out there called the
protocols of the Elders of Zion and I

5838
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:52,040
protocols of the Elders of Zion and I
 

5839
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:53,990
protocols of the Elders of Zion and I
fully understand that if you're not

5840
02:16:53,990 --> 02:16:54,000
fully understand that if you're not
 

5841
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,230
fully understand that if you're not
careful you can come close to writing

5842
02:16:57,230 --> 02:16:57,240
careful you can come close to writing
 

5843
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:00,709
careful you can come close to writing
volume two of the protocol but I don't

5844
02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:00,719
volume two of the protocol but I don't
 

5845
02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:03,230
volume two of the protocol but I don't
believe that we wrote anything that was

5846
02:17:03,230 --> 02:17:03,240
believe that we wrote anything that was
 

5847
02:17:03,240 --> 02:17:06,790
believe that we wrote anything that was
even close to that and again I think

5848
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:06,800
even close to that and again I think
 

5849
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:09,230
even close to that and again I think
that a healthy debate on the issues that

5850
02:17:09,230 --> 02:17:09,240
that a healthy debate on the issues that
 

5851
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:12,070
that a healthy debate on the issues that
we were raising would have been not only

5852
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:12,080
we were raising would have been not only
 

5853
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,629
we were raising would have been not only
in America's interest but it would have

5854
02:17:13,629 --> 02:17:13,639
in America's interest but it would have
 

5855
02:17:13,639 --> 02:17:14,950
in America's interest but it would have
been in Israel's

5856
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:14,960
been in Israel's
 

5857
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:17,870
been in Israel's
interest yeah I mean know underneath at

5858
02:17:17,870 --> 02:17:17,880
interest yeah I mean know underneath at
 

5859
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:21,429
interest yeah I mean know underneath at
all is just I wonder why there is so

5860
02:17:21,429 --> 02:17:21,439
all is just I wonder why there is so
 

5861
02:17:21,439 --> 02:17:25,070
all is just I wonder why there is so
much hate against groups why it's such a

5862
02:17:25,070 --> 02:17:25,080
much hate against groups why it's such a
 

5863
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:27,429
much hate against groups why it's such a
sticky way of

5864
02:17:27,429 --> 02:17:27,439
sticky way of
 

5865
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:30,669
sticky way of
thinking not just tribalism like proud

5866
02:17:30,669 --> 02:17:30,679
thinking not just tribalism like proud
 

5867

like hating in a way where it's part of
 

5873
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,070
like hating in a way where it's part of
your identity kind of

02:17:39,070 --> 02:17:39,080
your identity kind of
 

5875
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:43,110

hate well just to make a general point
 

5877
02:17:43,120 --> 02:17:45,830
hate well just to make a general point
on this issue in our conversation here

02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:45,840
on this issue in our conversation here
 

5879
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:48,950
on this issue in our conversation here
today you often talk about individual

5880
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:48,960
today you often talk about individual
 

5881
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:52,110
today you often talk about individual
leaders and the word individual often

leaders and the word individual often
 

5883
02:17:52,120 --> 02:17:55,270

pops up in your vocabulary yes I believe

that we are ultimately social animals
 

5887
02:17:58,240 --> 02:18:00,469
that we are ultimately social animals
before we are individuals I believe

5888
02:18:00,469 --> 02:18:00,479
before we are individuals I believe
 

5889
02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:03,270
before we are individuals I believe
we're born into tribes we're heavily

5890
02:18:03,270 --> 02:18:03,280
we're born into tribes we're heavily
 

5891
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:06,230
we're born into tribes we're heavily
socialized and that we carve out space

5892
02:18:06,230 --> 02:18:06,240
socialized and that we carve out space
 

5893
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:07,790
socialized and that we carve out space
for our

5894
02:18:07,790 --> 02:18:07,800
for our
 

5895
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:11,349
for our
individualism but we are part of tribes

5896
02:18:11,349 --> 02:18:11,359
individualism but we are part of tribes
 

5897
02:18:11,359 --> 02:18:13,990
individualism but we are part of tribes
and or social groups or nations call

5898
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,000
and or social groups or nations call
 

5899
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,830
and or social groups or nations call
them what you want ethnic groups

5900
02:18:16,830 --> 02:18:16,840
them what you want ethnic groups
 

5901
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:19,190
them what you want ethnic groups
religious groups but the fact is that

5902
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:19,200
religious groups but the fact is that
 

5903
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,509
religious groups but the fact is that
these tribes often crash into each other

5904
02:18:22,509 --> 02:18:22,519
these tribes often crash into each other
 

5905
02:18:22,519 --> 02:18:25,190
these tribes often crash into each other
and when they crash into each other they

5906
02:18:25,190 --> 02:18:25,200
and when they crash into each other they
 

5907
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:28,150
and when they crash into each other they
end up hating each other uh if you go to

5908
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:28,160
end up hating each other uh if you go to
 

5909
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:31,070
end up hating each other uh if you go to
a place like Bosnia right the croats and

5910
02:18:31,070 --> 02:18:31,080
a place like Bosnia right the croats and
 

5911

02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:35,870
the serbs oh my God and then throw in
the

5914
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:35,880
the
 

5915
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:38,750
the
bosniacs which is the term for Bosnian

5916
02:18:38,750 --> 02:18:38,760
bosniacs which is the term for Bosnian
 

5917
02:18:38,760 --> 02:18:42,709
bosniacs which is the term for Bosnian
Muslims and you know Muslims cowat serbs

5918
02:18:42,709 --> 02:18:42,719
Muslims and you know Muslims cowat serbs
 

5919
02:18:42,719 --> 02:18:47,750

uh oh and uh the tribes you know hate

5920
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:47,760
uh oh and uh the tribes you know hate
 

5921
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:52,349
uh oh and uh the tribes you know hate
each other uh and uh in a funny way that

5922
02:18:52,349 --> 02:18:52,359
each other uh and uh in a funny way that
 

5923
02:18:52,359 --> 02:18:56,750
each other uh and uh in a funny way that
hatred almost never goes away uh and uh

5924
02:18:56,750 --> 02:18:56,760
hatred almost never goes away uh and uh
 

5925
02:18:56,760 --> 02:18:58,589
hatred almost never goes away uh and uh
I guess there are some exceptions to

5926
02:18:58,589 --> 02:18:58,599
I guess there are some exceptions to
 

5927
02:18:58,599 --> 02:19:00,830
I guess there are some exceptions to
that uh if you look at the Germans after

5928
02:19:00,830 --> 02:19:00,840
that uh if you look at the Germans after
 

5929
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:03,190
that uh if you look at the Germans after
World War II they've gone a long way

5930
02:19:03,190 --> 02:19:03,200
World War II they've gone a long way
 

5931
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:06,190
World War II they've gone a long way
towards reducing I wouldn't want to say

5932
02:19:06,190 --> 02:19:06,200
towards reducing I wouldn't want to say
 

5933
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:08,669
towards reducing I wouldn't want to say
completely eliminating but reducing a

5934
02:19:08,669 --> 02:19:08,679
completely eliminating but reducing a
 

5935
02:19:08,679 --> 02:19:11,750
completely eliminating but reducing a
lot of the hatred uh that existed

5936
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:11,760
lot of the hatred uh that existed
 

5937
02:19:11,760 --> 02:19:14,389
lot of the hatred uh that existed
between Germans and their

5938
02:19:14,389 --> 02:19:14,399
between Germans and their
 

5939
02:19:14,399 --> 02:19:16,750
between Germans and their
neighbors uh but that's really kind of

5940
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:16,760
neighbors uh but that's really kind of
 

5941
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:18,110
neighbors uh but that's really kind of
an anomalous

5942
02:19:18,110 --> 02:19:18,120
an anomalous
 

5943
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:21,549
an anomalous
case uh I mean you go around East Asia

5944
02:19:21,549 --> 02:19:21,559
case uh I mean you go around East Asia
 

5945
02:19:21,559 --> 02:19:24,950
case uh I mean you go around East Asia
today and the hatred of Japan in a place

5946
02:19:24,950 --> 02:19:24,960
today and the hatred of Japan in a place
 

5947
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:27,349
today and the hatred of Japan in a place
like China the hatred of Japan in a

5948
02:19:27,349 --> 02:19:27,359
like China the hatred of Japan in a
 

5949
02:19:27,359 --> 02:19:30,230
like China the hatred of Japan in a
place like Korea just not to be

5950
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:30,240
place like Korea just not to be
 

5951
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:33,309
place like Korea just not to be
underestimated and uh so but I think a

5952
02:19:33,309 --> 02:19:33,319
underestimated and uh so but I think a
 

5953
02:19:33,319 --> 02:19:35,030
underestimated and uh so but I think a
lot of it just has to do with the fact

5954
02:19:35,030 --> 02:19:35,040
lot of it just has to do with the fact
 

5955
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:36,429
lot of it just has to do with the fact
that you're dealing with social groups

5956
02:19:36,429 --> 02:19:36,439
that you're dealing with social groups
 

5957
02:19:36,439 --> 02:19:39,110
that you're dealing with social groups
that have crashed into each other uh at

5958
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:39,120
that have crashed into each other uh at
 

5959
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:41,230
that have crashed into each other uh at
one point or another and there are those

5960
02:19:41,230 --> 02:19:41,240
one point or another and there are those
 

5961
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:43,589
one point or another and there are those
lingering effects and by the way this

5962
02:19:43,589 --> 02:19:43,599
lingering effects and by the way this
 

5963
02:19:43,599 --> 02:19:45,589
lingering effects and by the way this
gets back to our discussion a few

5964
02:19:45,589 --> 02:19:45,599
gets back to our discussion a few
 

5965
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:47,549
gets back to our discussion a few
minutes ago about trying to get it to

5966
02:19:47,549 --> 02:19:47,559

genocide right the Holocaust is not the
 

6033
02:21:13,479 --> 02:21:14,349

is used too Loosely

6038
02:21:20,230 --> 02:21:20,240
is used too Loosely
 

6039
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:24,469
is used too Loosely
today uh and as you know lots of people

6040
02:21:24,469 --> 02:21:24,479
today uh and as you know lots of people
 

6041
02:21:24,479 --> 02:21:26,590
today uh and as you know lots of people
and I mean lots of people who are pro

Palestinian accuse the Israelis of

6044
02:21:29,349 --> 02:21:29,359
Palestinian accuse the Israelis of
 

6045
02:21:29,359 --> 02:21:32,429
Palestinian accuse the Israelis of
engaging in genocide in Gaza I think

6046
02:21:32,429 --> 02:21:32,439
engaging in genocide in Gaza I think
 

6047
02:21:32,439 --> 02:21:37,790
engaging in genocide in Gaza I think
what the Israelis are doing in Gaza uh

6048
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:37,800
what the Israelis are doing in Gaza uh
 

6049
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:40,270
what the Israelis are doing in Gaza uh
represents a massacre I I would use that

6050
02:21:40,270 --> 02:21:40,280
represents a massacre I I would use that
 

6051
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:42,750
represents a massacre I I would use that
term given the number of civilians that

6052
02:21:42,750 --> 02:21:42,760
term given the number of civilians that
 

6053
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:44,630
term given the number of civilians that
they've killed and the fact that they've

6054
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:44,640
they've killed and the fact that they've
 

6055
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:46,550
they've killed and the fact that they've
been indiscriminate in terms of how

6056
02:21:46,550 --> 02:21:46,560
been indiscriminate in terms of how
 

6057
02:21:46,560 --> 02:21:50,389
been indiscriminate in terms of how
they've been bombing Gaza but I would

6058
02:21:50,389 --> 02:21:50,399
they've been bombing Gaza but I would
 

6059
02:21:50,399 --> 02:21:52,349
they've been bombing Gaza but I would
not use the word

6060
02:21:52,349 --> 02:21:52,359
not use the word
 

6061
02:21:52,359 --> 02:21:54,910
not use the word
genocide uh for me a genocide is where

6062
02:21:54,910 --> 02:21:54,920
genocide uh for me a genocide is where
 

6063
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:59,030
genocide uh for me a genocide is where
one side attempts to eliminate another

6064
02:21:59,030 --> 02:21:59,040
one side attempts to eliminate another
 

6065
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:02,790
one side attempts to eliminate another
group from the planet uh I think that

6066
02:22:02,790 --> 02:22:02,800
group from the planet uh I think that
 

6067
02:22:02,800 --> 02:22:04,710
group from the planet uh I think that
what happened with the Holocaust was

6068
02:22:04,710 --> 02:22:04,720
what happened with the Holocaust was
 

6069
02:22:04,720 --> 02:22:08,309
what happened with the Holocaust was
clearly a genocide and that the Germans

6070
02:22:08,309 --> 02:22:08,319
clearly a genocide and that the Germans
 

6071
02:22:08,319 --> 02:22:11,750
clearly a genocide and that the Germans
were bent uh on destroying all of

6072
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:11,760
were bent uh on destroying all of
 

6073
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:13,950
were bent uh on destroying all of
European jewry and if they could have

6074
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:13,960
European jewry and if they could have
 

6075
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:17,750
European jewry and if they could have
gotten their hands on uh Jews outside of

6076
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:17,760
gotten their hands on uh Jews outside of
 

6077
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:19,630
gotten their hands on uh Jews outside of
Europe they would have murdered them as

6078
02:22:19,630 --> 02:22:19,640
Europe they would have murdered them as
 

6079
02:22:19,640 --> 02:22:22,550
Europe they would have murdered them as
well that's a genocide and I think with

6080
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:22,560
well that's a genocide and I think with
 

6081
02:22:22,560 --> 02:22:24,469
well that's a genocide and I think with
the hutus and the tootsies you had a

6082
02:22:24,469 --> 02:22:24,479
the hutus and the tootsies you had a
 

6083
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:25,469
the hutus and the tootsies you had a
similar

6084
02:22:25,469 --> 02:22:25,479
similar
 

6085
02:22:25,479 --> 02:22:28,150
similar
situation uh I think with the Turks and

6086
02:22:28,150 --> 02:22:28,160
situation uh I think with the Turks and
 

6087
02:22:28,160 --> 02:22:30,670
situation uh I think with the Turks and
the Armenians during World War I that

6088
02:22:30,670 --> 02:22:30,680
the Armenians during World War I that
 

6089
02:22:30,680 --> 02:22:32,910
the Armenians during World War I that
was a genocide but I have a rather

6090
02:22:32,910 --> 02:22:32,920
was a genocide but I have a rather
 

6091
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:35,309
was a genocide but I have a rather
narrow definition of what a genocide is

6092
02:22:35,309 --> 02:22:35,319
narrow definition of what a genocide is
 

6093
02:22:35,319 --> 02:22:37,230
narrow definition of what a genocide is
and I don't think there are many cases

6094
02:22:37,230 --> 02:22:37,240
and I don't think there are many cases
 

6095
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:40,309
and I don't think there are many cases
that qualify as a genocide the Holocaust

6096
02:22:40,309 --> 02:22:40,319
that qualify as a genocide the Holocaust
 

6097
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:43,469
that qualify as a genocide the Holocaust
certainly does okay

6098
02:22:43,469 --> 02:22:43,479
certainly does okay
 

6099
02:22:43,479 --> 02:22:47,790
certainly does okay
now what Hamas did doesn't even come

6100
02:22:47,790 --> 02:22:47,800
now what Hamas did doesn't even come
 

6101
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:52,389
now what Hamas did doesn't even come
close to what happened to European jury

6102
02:22:52,389 --> 02:22:52,399
close to what happened to European jury
 

6103
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:55,030
close to what happened to European jury
between let's say

6104
02:22:55,030 --> 02:22:55,040
between let's say
 

6105
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:58,870
between let's say
1939 uh and 1945 although I date the

6106
02:22:58,870 --> 02:22:58,880
1939 uh and 1945 although I date the
 

6107
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:00,830
1939 uh and 1945 although I date the
start of the Holocaust to

6108
02:23:00,830 --> 02:23:00,840
start of the Holocaust to
 

6109
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,670
start of the Holocaust to
1941 if we were you know looking at it

6110
02:23:03,670 --> 02:23:03,680
1941 if we were you know looking at it
 

6111
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:06,030
1941 if we were you know looking at it
closely but let's just say 1939 when

6112
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:06,040
closely but let's just say 1939 when
 

6113
02:23:06,040 --> 02:23:09,870
closely but let's just say 1939 when
they invade Poland 1939 to

6114
02:23:09,870 --> 02:23:09,880
they invade Poland 1939 to
 

6115
02:23:09,880 --> 02:23:11,590
they invade Poland 1939 to
1945

6116
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:11,600
1945
 

6117
02:23:11,600 --> 02:23:14,389
1945
whated pales in comparison it's hard to

6118
02:23:14,389 --> 02:23:14,399
whated pales in comparison it's hard to
 

6119
02:23:14,399 --> 02:23:16,389
whated pales in comparison it's hard to
believe anybody would make that argument

6120
02:23:16,389 --> 02:23:16,399
believe anybody would make that argument
 

6121
02:23:16,399 --> 02:23:20,070
believe anybody would make that argument
right yeah yes a lot of Jews died uh but

6122
02:23:20,070 --> 02:23:20,080
right yeah yes a lot of Jews died uh but
 

6123
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:22,269
right yeah yes a lot of Jews died uh but

my my view is states are rational actors

02:28:49,710 --> 02:28:49,720
my my view is states are rational actors
 

6363
02:28:49,720 --> 02:28:51,469
my my view is states are rational actors
they should be cunning right they should

why my theory is not always correct is

6372
02:29:03,269 --> 02:29:03,279
why my theory is not always correct is
 

6373
02:29:03,279 --> 02:29:05,830
why my theory is not always correct is
that sometimes states are not rational

6374
02:29:05,830 --> 02:29:05,840
that sometimes states are not rational
 

6375
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:08,070
that sometimes states are not rational
and they

6376
02:29:08,070 --> 02:29:08,080
and they
 

6377
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:11,030
and they
misbehave I would argue in the Israeli

misbehave I would argue in the Israeli
 

6379
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:14,790
misbehave I would argue in the Israeli
case uh that it would have been good

6380
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:14,800
case uh that it would have been good

October 7th if the United States had uh
 

6385
02:29:22,439 --> 02:29:25,790
October 7th if the United States had uh
tried to hold the Israelis back and

02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:25,800
tried to hold the Israelis back and
 

6387
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:30,309
tried to hold the Israelis back and
countenance uh a more uh moderate

response a more uh to SP take some time
 

6391
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:36,230
response a more uh to SP take some time
just to think about how to deal with

6392
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,240
just to think about how to deal with
 

6393
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:39,110
just to think about how to deal with
this problem instead of lashing out I I

6394
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:39,120
this problem instead of lashing out I I
 

6395
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:41,030
this problem instead of lashing out I I
think given what happened to the

6396
02:29:41,030 --> 02:29:41,040
think given what happened to the
 

6397
02:29:41,040 --> 02:29:43,510
think given what happened to the
Israelis given how shocked they were

6398
02:29:43,510 --> 02:29:43,520
Israelis given how shocked they were
 

6399

given the level of fear given the level

given the level of fear given the level
 

6401
02:29:46,120 --> 02:29:49,030
given the level of fear given the level
of AG they were going to lash out and I

6402
02:29:49,030 --> 02:29:49,040
of AG they were going to lash out and I
 

6403
02:29:49,040 --> 02:29:51,469
of AG they were going to lash out and I
don't believe that was in their interest

6404
02:29:51,469 --> 02:29:51,479
don't believe that was in their interest
 

6405
02:29:51,479 --> 02:29:53,469
don't believe that was in their interest
I think it would have been made would

6406
02:29:53,469 --> 02:29:53,479
I think it would have been made would
 

6407
02:29:53,479 --> 02:29:56,870
I think it would have been made would
have made sense to to think about it and

6408
02:29:56,870 --> 02:29:56,880
have made sense to to think about it and
 

6409
02:29:56,880 --> 02:29:59,110
have made sense to to think about it and
uh to think about a smarter strategy

6410
02:29:59,110 --> 02:29:59,120
uh to think about a smarter strategy
 

6411
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:02,030
uh to think about a smarter strategy
than they're now employing and I think

6412
02:30:02,030 --> 02:30:02,040
than they're now employing and I think
 

6413
02:30:02,040 --> 02:30:03,710
than they're now employing and I think
you know the Americans blew it the

6414
02:30:03,710 --> 02:30:03,720
you know the Americans blew it the
 

6415
02:30:03,720 --> 02:30:06,070
you know the Americans blew it the
Americans gave them a be hug and a green

6416
02:30:06,070 --> 02:30:06,080
Americans gave them a be hug and a green
 

6417
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:07,830
Americans gave them a be hug and a green
light and said we'll give you all the

6418
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:07,840
light and said we'll give you all the
 

6419
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:11,309
light and said we'll give you all the
Weaponry you need and go out and do it

6420
02:30:11,309 --> 02:30:11,319
Weaponry you need and go out and do it
 

6421
02:30:11,319 --> 02:30:13,710
Weaponry you need and go out and do it
and uh I don't think that was the smart

6422
02:30:13,710 --> 02:30:13,720
and uh I don't think that was the smart
 

6423
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:17,429
and uh I don't think that was the smart
thing to do look in the wake of October

6424
02:30:17,429 --> 02:30:17,439
thing to do look in the wake of October
 

6425
02:30:17,439 --> 02:30:21,110
thing to do look in the wake of October
7th the Israelis had no good strategy

6426
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:21,120
7th the Israelis had no good strategy
 

6427
02:30:21,120 --> 02:30:22,990
7th the Israelis had no good strategy
right it's it's not like there's a magic

6428
02:30:22,990 --> 02:30:23,000
right it's it's not like there's a magic
 

6429
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,030
right it's it's not like there's a magic
formula that they just didn't see and we

6430
02:30:25,030 --> 02:30:25,040
formula that they just didn't see and we
 

6431
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:26,309
formula that they just didn't see and we
should have told them what the magic

6432
02:30:26,309 --> 02:30:26,319
should have told them what the magic
 

6433
02:30:26,319 --> 02:30:29,510
should have told them what the magic
formula was right that's not true they

6434
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:29,520
formula was right that's not true they
 

6435
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:31,710
formula was right that's not true they
were in a sense caught between IR Roa

6436
02:30:31,710 --> 02:30:31,720
were in a sense caught between IR Roa
 

6437
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:34,349
were in a sense caught between IR Roa
and a hard place in terms of what to do

6438
02:30:34,349 --> 02:30:34,359
and a hard place in terms of what to do
 

6439
02:30:34,359 --> 02:30:36,150
and a hard place in terms of what to do
but they're smarter things and Dumber

6440
02:30:36,150 --> 02:30:36,160
but they're smarter things and Dumber
 

6441
02:30:36,160 --> 02:30:39,950
but they're smarter things and Dumber
things and I think the

6442
02:30:39,950 --> 02:30:39,960

 

6443
02:30:39,960 --> 02:30:44,510

Israelis lashed out in ways that are

6444
02:30:44,510 --> 02:30:44,520
Israelis lashed out in ways that are
 

6445
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:46,990
Israelis lashed out in ways that are
counterproductive I think you know going

6446
02:30:46,990 --> 02:30:47,000
counterproductive I think you know going
 

6447
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,710
counterproductive I think you know going
on a rampage and you know killing huge

6448
02:30:49,710 --> 02:30:49,720
on a rampage and you know killing huge
 

6449
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:52,830
on a rampage and you know killing huge
numbers of civilians is not it's

6450
02:30:52,830 --> 02:30:52,840
numbers of civilians is not it's
 

6451
02:30:52,840 --> 02:30:55,830
numbers of civilians is not it's
obviously morally wrong but it's also

6452
02:30:55,830 --> 02:30:55,840
obviously morally wrong but it's also
 

6453
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:58,469
obviously morally wrong but it's also
just not in their strategic interest

6454
02:30:58,469 --> 02:30:58,479
just not in their strategic interest
 

6455
02:30:58,479 --> 02:31:01,590
just not in their strategic interest
right I mean uh because it's it's not

6456
02:31:01,590 --> 02:31:01,600
right I mean uh because it's it's not
 

6457
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:04,349
right I mean uh because it's it's not
going to buy them anything right and in

6458
02:31:04,349 --> 02:31:04,359
going to buy them anything right and in
 

6459
02:31:04,359 --> 02:31:06,429
going to buy them anything right and in
fact it's going to cost them right

6460
02:31:06,429 --> 02:31:06,439
fact it's going to cost them right
 

6461
02:31:06,439 --> 02:31:08,950
fact it's going to cost them right
because people all over the planet are

6462
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:08,960
because people all over the planet are
 

6463
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:12,910
because people all over the planet are
turning against Israel uh I saw you know

6464
02:31:12,910 --> 02:31:12,920
turning against Israel uh I saw you know
 

6465
02:31:12,920 --> 02:31:16,710
turning against Israel uh I saw you know
an Israeli think tank today uh that has

6466
02:31:16,710 --> 02:31:16,720
an Israeli think tank today uh that has
 

6467
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:21,630
an Israeli think tank today uh that has
been tracking U protests around the

6468
02:31:21,630 --> 02:31:21,640
been tracking U protests around the
 

6469
02:31:21,640 --> 02:31:25,269
been tracking U protests around the
world um gave some figures for what it

6470
02:31:25,269 --> 02:31:25,279
world um gave some figures for what it
 

6471
02:31:25,279 --> 02:31:28,750
world um gave some figures for what it
looked like uh between October 7th and

6472
02:31:28,750 --> 02:31:28,760
looked like uh between October 7th and
 

6473
02:31:28,760 --> 02:31:32,230
looked like uh between October 7th and
October 13th in terms of the number of

6474
02:31:32,230 --> 02:31:32,240
October 13th in terms of the number of
 

6475
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:34,590
October 13th in terms of the number of
uh protests around the world that were

6476
02:31:34,590 --> 02:31:34,600
uh protests around the world that were
 

6477
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:37,870
uh protests around the world that were
pro-israel versus Pro Palestine and then

6478
02:31:37,870 --> 02:31:37,880
pro-israel versus Pro Palestine and then
 

6479
02:31:37,880 --> 02:31:40,910
pro-israel versus Pro Palestine and then
it looked at the numbers from U October

6480
02:31:40,910 --> 02:31:40,920
it looked at the numbers from U October
 

6481
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:44,349
it looked at the numbers from U October
13th up to the present and I think the

6482
02:31:44,349 --> 02:31:44,359
13th up to the present and I think the
 

6483
02:31:44,359 --> 02:31:48,830
13th up to the present and I think the
numbers were 69 9% were Pro Palestinian

6484
02:31:48,830 --> 02:31:48,840
numbers were 69 9% were Pro Palestinian
 

6485
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:52,389
numbers were 69 9% were Pro Palestinian
in the first six days after October 7th

6486
02:31:52,389 --> 02:31:52,399
in the first six days after October 7th
 

6487
02:31:52,399 --> 02:31:55,830
in the first six days after October 7th
69% and I think 31% take these numbers

6488
02:31:55,830 --> 02:31:55,840
69% and I think 31% take these numbers
 

6489
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:59,269
69% and I think 31% take these numbers
with a grain of salt 31% were pro-israel

6490
02:31:59,269 --> 02:31:59,279
with a grain of salt 31% were pro-israel
 

6491
02:31:59,279 --> 02:32:02,030
with a grain of salt 31% were pro-israel
so I think it was 69 and

6492
02:32:02,030 --> 02:32:02,040
so I think it was 69 and
 

6493
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:08,190
so I think it was 69 and
31 um and uh since then since October

6494
02:32:08,190 --> 02:32:08,200
31 um and uh since then since October
 

6495
02:32:08,200 --> 02:32:09,830
31 um and uh since then since October
13th if you look at the number of

6496
02:32:09,830 --> 02:32:09,840
13th if you look at the number of
 

6497
02:32:09,840 --> 02:32:12,830
13th if you look at the number of
protests around the world 95% have been

6498
02:32:12,830 --> 02:32:12,840
protests around the world 95% have been
 

6499
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:15,269
protests around the world 95% have been
Pro Palestinian and 5% have been

6500
02:32:15,269 --> 02:32:15,279
Pro Palestinian and 5% have been
 

6501
02:32:15,279 --> 02:32:17,230
Pro Palestinian and 5% have been
pro-israel

6502
02:32:17,230 --> 02:32:17,240
pro-israel
 

6503
02:32:17,240 --> 02:32:19,790
pro-israel
uh and what this tells you is that

6504
02:32:19,790 --> 02:32:19,800
uh and what this tells you is that
 

6505
02:32:19,800 --> 02:32:21,630
uh and what this tells you is that
public opinion around the world has

6506
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:21,640
public opinion around the world has
 

6507
02:32:21,640 --> 02:32:24,309
public opinion around the world has
shifted against Israel and if you look

6508
02:32:24,309 --> 02:32:24,319
shifted against Israel and if you look
 

6509
02:32:24,319 --> 02:32:26,389
shifted against Israel and if you look
at some of the demonstrations in places

6510
02:32:26,389 --> 02:32:26,399
at some of the demonstrations in places
 

6511
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:29,710
at some of the demonstrations in places
like London and Washington DC it's truly

6512
02:32:29,710 --> 02:32:29,720
like London and Washington DC it's truly
 

6513
02:32:29,720 --> 02:32:31,550
like London and Washington DC it's truly
amazing the number of people who are

6514
02:32:31,550 --> 02:32:31,560
amazing the number of people who are
 

6515
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:34,150
amazing the number of people who are
coming out in support of the

6516
02:32:34,150 --> 02:32:34,160
coming out in support of the
 

6517
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:37,550
coming out in support of the
Palestinians and uh all this again is

6518
02:32:37,550 --> 02:32:37,560
Palestinians and uh all this again is
 

6519
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:39,670
Palestinians and uh all this again is
just to support my point that it was

6520
02:32:39,670 --> 02:32:39,680
just to support my point that it was
 

6521
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:43,150
just to support my point that it was
just not smart for Israel to uh launch

6522
02:32:43,150 --> 02:32:43,160
just not smart for Israel to uh launch
 

6523
02:32:43,160 --> 02:32:46,070
just not smart for Israel to uh launch
this bombing campaign right you can make

6524
02:32:46,070 --> 02:32:46,080
this bombing campaign right you can make
 

6525
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:48,750
this bombing campaign right you can make
it an argument for going after Hamas and

6526
02:32:48,750 --> 02:32:48,760
it an argument for going after Hamas and
 

6527
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:50,950
it an argument for going after Hamas and
doing it in a surgical way or as

6528
02:32:50,950 --> 02:32:50,960
doing it in a surgical way or as
 

6529
02:32:50,960 --> 02:32:54,990
doing it in a surgical way or as
surgical a way as possible uh but uh

6530
02:32:54,990 --> 02:32:55,000
surgical a way as possible uh but uh
 

6531
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,429
surgical a way as possible uh but uh
that's not what they did and again my

6532
02:32:57,429 --> 02:32:57,439
that's not what they did and again my
 

6533
02:32:57,439 --> 02:32:59,469
that's not what they did and again my
point to you is I think that this

6534
02:32:59,469 --> 02:32:59,479
point to you is I think that this
 

6535
02:32:59,479 --> 02:33:02,389
point to you is I think that this
punishment campaign is not going to work

6536
02:33:02,389 --> 02:33:02,399
punishment campaign is not going to work
 

6537
02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:04,190
punishment campaign is not going to work
strategically in other words they're not

6538
02:33:04,190 --> 02:33:04,200
strategically in other words they're not
 

6539
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:05,910
strategically in other words they're not
going to beat the Palestinians into

6540
02:33:05,910 --> 02:33:05,920
going to beat the Palestinians into
 

6541
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:07,349
going to beat the Palestinians into
submission they're not going to finish

6542
02:33:07,349 --> 02:33:07,359
submission they're not going to finish
 

6543
02:33:07,359 --> 02:33:09,750
submission they're not going to finish
off Hamas and at the same time by

6544
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:09,760
off Hamas and at the same time by
 

6545
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:12,550
off Hamas and at the same time by
pursuing this strategy they're doing

6546
02:33:12,550 --> 02:33:12,560
pursuing this strategy they're doing
 

6547
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:15,550
pursuing this strategy they're doing
huge damage to their reputation around

6548
02:33:15,550 --> 02:33:15,560
huge damage to their reputation around
 

6549
02:33:15,560 --> 02:33:16,670
huge damage to their reputation around
the world

6550
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:16,680
the world
 

6551
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:19,710
the world
well I just uh yeah in the wake of

6552
02:33:19,710 --> 02:33:19,720
well I just uh yeah in the wake of
 

6553
02:33:19,720 --> 02:33:22,670
well I just uh yeah in the wake of
October

6554
02:33:22,670 --> 02:33:22,680

 

6555
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:26,150

7th given the geopolitical

6556
02:33:26,150 --> 02:33:26,160
7th given the geopolitical
 

6557
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:29,510
7th given the geopolitical
context I think there's a lot of

6558
02:33:29,510 --> 02:33:29,520
context I think there's a lot of
 

6559
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:32,790
context I think there's a lot of
Leverage to be the great ethical

6560
02:33:32,790 --> 02:33:32,800
Leverage to be the great ethical
 

6561
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:35,150
Leverage to be the great ethical
superpower that demonstrate power

6562
02:33:35,150 --> 02:33:35,160
superpower that demonstrate power
 

6563
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:36,590
superpower that demonstrate power
without killing any

6564
02:33:36,590 --> 02:33:36,600
without killing any
 

6565
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:39,150
without killing any
civilians and use that leverage

6566
02:33:39,150 --> 02:33:39,160
civilians and use that leverage
 

6567
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:41,469
civilians and use that leverage
diplomatic leverage to push forward

6568
02:33:41,469 --> 02:33:41,479
diplomatic leverage to push forward
 

6569
02:33:41,479 --> 02:33:44,030
diplomatic leverage to push forward
something like abrahamic Accords with

6570
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:44,040
something like abrahamic Accords with
 

6571
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:46,910
something like abrahamic Accords with
more nations with with Saudi Arabia

6572
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:46,920
more nations with with Saudi Arabia
 

6573
02:33:46,920 --> 02:33:48,389
more nations with with Saudi Arabia
push for peace

6574
02:33:48,389 --> 02:33:48,399
push for peace
 

6575
02:33:48,399 --> 02:33:50,550
push for peace
aggressively peace agreements this kind

6576
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:50,560
aggressively peace agreements this kind
 

6577
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:52,630
aggressively peace agreements this kind
of stuff economic relationships all this

6578
02:33:52,630 --> 02:33:52,640
of stuff economic relationships all this
 

6579
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:56,110
of stuff economic relationships all this
kind of stuff and thereby pressure the

6580
02:33:56,110 --> 02:33:56,120
kind of stuff and thereby pressure the
 

6581
02:33:56,120 --> 02:34:00,469
kind of stuff and thereby pressure the
Palestinian Authority you know towards

6582
02:34:00,469 --> 02:34:00,479
Palestinian Authority you know towards
 

6583
02:34:00,479 --> 02:34:03,190
Palestinian Authority you know towards
um perhaps a two State

6584
02:34:03,190 --> 02:34:03,200
um perhaps a two State
 

6585
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:05,429
um perhaps a two State
solution but I think what you're missing

6586
02:34:05,429 --> 02:34:05,439
solution but I think what you're missing
 

6587
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:07,550
solution but I think what you're missing
here just in the Israeli case is that

6588
02:34:07,550 --> 02:34:07,560
here just in the Israeli case is that
 

6589
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:09,429
here just in the Israeli case is that
the Israeli government is not interested

6590
02:34:09,429 --> 02:34:09,439
the Israeli government is not interested
 

6591
02:34:09,439 --> 02:34:11,269
the Israeli government is not interested
in two-state solution and you want to

6592
02:34:11,269 --> 02:34:11,279
in two-state solution and you want to
 

6593
02:34:11,279 --> 02:34:15,070
in two-state solution and you want to
remember that Benjamin Netanyahu who

6594
02:34:15,070 --> 02:34:15,080

6755
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:55,830
down and said we're not negotiating so
we have blown a number of opportunities

6756
02:37:55,830 --> 02:37:55,840
we have blown a number of opportunities
 

6757
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:58,110
we have blown a number of opportunities
here to head this problem off at the

6758
02:37:58,110 --> 02:37:58,120
here to head this problem off at the
 

6759
02:37:58,120 --> 02:38:02,550
here to head this problem off at the
pass uh and uh but that's my view there

6760
02:38:02,550 --> 02:38:02,560
pass uh and uh but that's my view there
 

6761
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:04,950
pass uh and uh but that's my view there
and uh with regard to the Israelis my

6762
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:04,960
and uh with regard to the Israelis my
 

6763
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:07,830
and uh with regard to the Israelis my
only point about Israel is that it would

6764
02:38:07,830 --> 02:38:07,840
only point about Israel is that it would
 

6765
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:10,150
only point about Israel is that it would
be better for Israel and better for the

6766
02:38:10,150 --> 02:38:10,160
be better for Israel and better for the
 

6767
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:13,429
be better for Israel and better for the
United States if we the United States

6768
02:38:13,429 --> 02:38:13,439
United States if we the United States
 

6769
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:15,349
United States if we the United States
were in was in a position the United

6770
02:38:15,349 --> 02:38:15,359
were in was in a position the United
 

6771
02:38:15,359 --> 02:38:17,870
were in was in a position the United
States was in a position to put pressure

6772
02:38:17,870 --> 02:38:17,880
States was in a position to put pressure
 

6773
02:38:17,880 --> 02:38:20,510
States was in a position to put pressure
on Israel from time to time as Steve and

6774
02:38:20,510 --> 02:38:20,520
on Israel from time to time as Steve and
 

6775
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:22,870
on Israel from time to time as Steve and
I say in the book we should be able to

6776
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:22,880
I say in the book we should be able to
 

6777
02:38:22,880 --> 02:38:26,030
I say in the book we should be able to
treat Israel like a normal country right

6778
02:38:26,030 --> 02:38:26,040
treat Israel like a normal country right
 

6779
02:38:26,040 --> 02:38:28,230
treat Israel like a normal country right
the fact is that countries sometimes do

6780
02:38:28,230 --> 02:38:28,240
the fact is that countries sometimes do
 

6781
02:38:28,240 --> 02:38:30,790
the fact is that countries sometimes do
stupid things this includes the United

6782
02:38:30,790 --> 02:38:30,800
stupid things this includes the United
 

6783
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:33,590
stupid things this includes the United
States and Israel and if Israel is

6784
02:38:33,590 --> 02:38:33,600
States and Israel and if Israel is
 

6785
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:35,469
States and Israel and if Israel is
pursuing a policy that we think is

6786
02:38:35,469 --> 02:38:35,479
pursuing a policy that we think is
 

6787
02:38:35,479 --> 02:38:37,670
pursuing a policy that we think is
unwise we should be in a position where

6788
02:38:37,670 --> 02:38:37,680
unwise we should be in a position where
 

6789
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:39,750
unwise we should be in a position where
we could put pressure on Israel yeah

6790
02:38:39,750 --> 02:38:39,760
we could put pressure on Israel yeah
 

6791
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:42,710
we could put pressure on Israel yeah
that's our argument right but

6792
02:38:42,710 --> 02:38:42,720
that's our argument right but
 

6793
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:46,550
that's our argument right but
anyway we goofed both with regard to

6794
02:38:46,550 --> 02:38:46,560
anyway we goofed both with regard to
 

6795
02:38:46,560 --> 02:38:49,309
anyway we goofed both with regard to
Ukraine and with regard to the Middle

6796
02:38:49,309 --> 02:38:49,319
Ukraine and with regard to the Middle
 

6797
02:38:49,319 --> 02:38:51,790
Ukraine and with regard to the Middle
East and we're now up to our eyeballs in

6798
02:38:51,790 --> 02:38:51,800
East and we're now up to our eyeballs in
 

6799
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:56,230
East and we're now up to our eyeballs in
alligators in both of those regions and

6800
02:38:56,230 --> 02:38:56,240
alligators in both of those regions and
 

6801
02:38:56,240 --> 02:39:00,269
alligators in both of those regions and
as you describe my view this is not good

6802
02:39:00,269 --> 02:39:00,279
as you describe my view this is not good
 

6803
02:39:00,279 --> 02:39:03,469
as you describe my view this is not good
because the area of the most strategic

6804
02:39:03,469 --> 02:39:03,479
because the area of the most strategic
 

6805
02:39:03,479 --> 02:39:05,790
because the area of the most strategic
importance for the United States Today

6806
02:39:05,790 --> 02:39:05,800
importance for the United States Today
 

6807
02:39:05,800 --> 02:39:08,790
importance for the United States Today
Is East Asia and that's because China is

6808
02:39:08,790 --> 02:39:08,800
Is East Asia and that's because China is
 

6809
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:11,950
Is East Asia and that's because China is
there and China is the most serious

6810
02:39:11,950 --> 02:39:11,960
there and China is the most serious
 

6811
02:39:11,960 --> 02:39:14,110
there and China is the most serious
threat the United States faces do you

6812
02:39:14,110 --> 02:39:14,120
threat the United States faces do you
 

6813
02:39:14,120 --> 02:39:16,349
threat the United States faces do you
think there will be a war

6814
02:39:16,349 --> 02:39:16,359
think there will be a war
 

6815
02:39:16,359 --> 02:39:19,670
think there will be a war
with China in the 21st century I don't

6816
02:39:19,670 --> 02:39:19,680
with China in the 21st century I don't
 

6817
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:22,950
with China in the 21st century I don't
know uh my argument is there will be

6818
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:22,960
know uh my argument is there will be
 

6819
02:39:22,960 --> 02:39:26,349
know uh my argument is there will be
there is right now a serious security

6820
02:39:26,349 --> 02:39:26,359
there is right now a serious security
 

6821
02:39:26,359 --> 02:39:29,150
there is right now a serious security
competition and uh at the same time

6822
02:39:29,150 --> 02:39:29,160
competition and uh at the same time
 

6823
02:39:29,160 --> 02:39:31,670
competition and uh at the same time
there is a real possibility of War

6824
02:39:31,670 --> 02:39:31,680
there is a real possibility of War
 

6825
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:33,990
there is a real possibility of War
whether or not we avoid it is very hard

6826
02:39:33,990 --> 02:39:34,000
whether or not we avoid it is very hard
 

6827
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:37,190
whether or not we avoid it is very hard
to say uh I mean we did during the Cold

6828
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:37,200
to say uh I mean we did during the Cold
 

6829
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:39,070
to say uh I mean we did during the Cold
War we had a serious security

6830
02:39:39,070 --> 02:39:39,080
War we had a serious security
 

6831
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:41,190
War we had a serious security
competition from roughly

6832
02:39:41,190 --> 02:39:41,200
competition from roughly
 

6833
02:39:41,200 --> 02:39:43,230
competition from roughly
1947 to

6834
02:39:43,230 --> 02:39:43,240
1947 to
 

6835
02:39:43,240 --> 02:39:46,309
1947 to
1989 and uh and we thankfully avoided

6836
02:39:46,309 --> 02:39:46,319
1989 and uh and we thankfully avoided
 

6837
02:39:46,319 --> 02:39:50,110
1989 and uh and we thankfully avoided
war probably came the closest in 1962

6838
02:39:50,110 --> 02:39:50,120
war probably came the closest in 1962
 

6839
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:51,710
war probably came the closest in 1962
with the Cuban Missile

6840
02:39:51,710 --> 02:39:51,720
with the Cuban Missile
 

6841
02:39:51,720 --> 02:39:56,150
with the Cuban Missile
Crisis but uh we avoided it and I think

6842
02:39:56,150 --> 02:39:56,160
Crisis but uh we avoided it and I think
 

6843
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:59,910
Crisis but uh we avoided it and I think
we can avoid it here is it for sure no

6844
02:39:59,910 --> 02:39:59,920
we can avoid it here is it for sure no
 

6845
02:39:59,920 --> 02:40:02,110
we can avoid it here is it for sure no
you've said that China won't move on

6846
02:40:02,110 --> 02:40:02,120
you've said that China won't move on
 

6847
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:05,150
you've said that China won't move on
Taiwan militarily in part because it's

6848
02:40:05,150 --> 02:40:05,160
Taiwan militarily in part because it's
 

6849
02:40:05,160 --> 02:40:08,429
Taiwan militarily in part because it's
uh as you said amphibious operations are

6850
02:40:08,429 --> 02:40:08,439
uh as you said amphibious operations are
 

6851
02:40:08,439 --> 02:40:11,469
uh as you said amphibious operations are
difficult why will China not move on

6852
02:40:11,469 --> 02:40:11,479
difficult why will China not move on
 

6853
02:40:11,479 --> 02:40:13,389
difficult why will China not move on
Taiwan is in your

6854
02:40:13,389 --> 02:40:13,399
Taiwan is in your
 

6855
02:40:13,399 --> 02:40:17,150
Taiwan is in your
sense uh in the near future well it's

6856
02:40:17,150 --> 02:40:17,160
sense uh in the near future well it's
 

6857
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:18,950
sense uh in the near future well it's
because there's this body of water

6858
02:40:18,950 --> 02:40:18,960
because there's this body of water
 

6859
02:40:18,960 --> 02:40:22,110
because there's this body of water
called the Taiwan straigh which is a big

6860
02:40:22,110 --> 02:40:22,120
called the Taiwan straigh which is a big
 

6861
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:25,910
called the Taiwan straigh which is a big
body of water and getting across water

6862
02:40:25,910 --> 02:40:25,920
body of water and getting across water
 

6863
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:28,630
body of water and getting across water
uh is very difficult unless you can walk

6864
02:40:28,630 --> 02:40:28,640
uh is very difficult unless you can walk
 

6865
02:40:28,640 --> 02:40:30,990
uh is very difficult unless you can walk
on water so geography still has a role

6866
02:40:30,990 --> 02:40:31,000
on water so geography still has a role
 

6867
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,190
on water so geography still has a role
to play in the 21st century oh yeah I

6868
02:40:33,190 --> 02:40:33,200
to play in the 21st century oh yeah I
 

6869
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:35,269
to play in the 21st century oh yeah I
think geography is very important big

6870
02:40:35,269 --> 02:40:35,279
think geography is very important big
 

6871
02:40:35,279 --> 02:40:38,309
think geography is very important big
bodies of water really matter yeah in an

6872
02:40:38,309 --> 02:40:38,319
bodies of water really matter yeah in an
 

6873
02:40:38,319 --> 02:40:39,790
bodies of water really matter yeah in an
Ideal World you'd like to have the

6874
02:40:39,790 --> 02:40:39,800
Ideal World you'd like to have the
 

6875
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:41,910
Ideal World you'd like to have the
Pacific Ocean between you and any

potential adversary you know 6,000 miles
yes 6 ,000 miles of water hard to get

6880
02:40:47,190 --> 02:40:47,200
yes 6 ,000 miles of water hard to get
 

6881

02:41:11,200 --> 02:41:12,550
divisions can't go across the water and
then the question is how do you get them

6902
02:41:12,550 --> 02:41:12,560
then the question is how do you get them
 

6903
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:16,110
then the question is how do you get them
across the water and that's very tricky

6904
02:41:16,110 --> 02:41:16,120
across the water and that's very tricky
 

6905
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:17,950
across the water and that's very tricky
and in a world we have lots of

6906
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:17,960
and in a world we have lots of
 

6907
02:41:17,960 --> 02:41:20,950
and in a world we have lots of
submarines and you have lots of aircraft

6908
02:41:20,950 --> 02:41:20,960
submarines and you have lots of aircraft
 

6909
02:41:20,960 --> 02:41:23,790
submarines and you have lots of aircraft
and you have missiles that are landbased

6910
02:41:23,790 --> 02:41:23,800
and you have missiles that are landbased
 

6911
02:41:23,800 --> 02:41:27,510
and you have missiles that are landbased
that can hit those surface ships it is

6912
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,520
that can hit those surface ships it is
 

6913
02:41:27,520 --> 02:41:30,670
that can hit those surface ships it is
very very hard to you know to attack

6914
02:41:30,670 --> 02:41:30,680
very very hard to you know to attack
 

6915
02:41:30,680 --> 02:41:32,870
very very hard to you know to attack
across a body of water and all you have

6916
02:41:32,870 --> 02:41:32,880
across a body of water and all you have
 

6917
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:36,150
across a body of water and all you have
to do is think about uh Normandy you

6918
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:36,160
to do is think about uh Normandy you
 

6919
02:41:36,160 --> 02:41:38,110
to do is think about uh Normandy you
know the American invasion of Normandy

6920
02:41:38,110 --> 02:41:38,120
know the American invasion of Normandy
 

6921
02:41:38,120 --> 02:41:42,590
know the American invasion of Normandy
June 6th 1944 coming in on Omaha Beach

6922
02:41:42,590 --> 02:41:42,600
June 6th 1944 coming in on Omaha Beach
 

6923
02:41:42,600 --> 02:41:45,870
June 6th 1944 coming in on Omaha Beach
right uh oh boy that was really

6924
02:41:45,870 --> 02:41:45,880
right uh oh boy that was really
 

6925
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:47,590
right uh oh boy that was really
difficult but there is a growing

6926
02:41:47,590 --> 02:41:47,600
difficult but there is a growing
 

6927
02:41:47,600 --> 02:41:51,710
difficult but there is a growing
asymmetry of military power there that

6928
02:41:51,710 --> 02:41:51,720
asymmetry of military power there that
 

6929
02:41:51,720 --> 02:41:54,030
asymmetry of military power there that
even though it's difficult that is

6930
02:41:54,030 --> 02:41:54,040
even though it's difficult that is
 

6931
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:58,150
even though it's difficult that is
correct so I I guess that is correct so

6932
02:41:58,150 --> 02:41:58,160
correct so I I guess that is correct so
 

6933
02:41:58,160 --> 02:41:59,950
correct so I I guess that is correct so
I recently had a conversation with Elon

6934
02:41:59,950 --> 02:41:59,960
I recently had a conversation with Elon
 

6935
02:41:59,960 --> 02:42:01,710
I recently had a conversation with Elon
Musk and and he

6936
02:42:01,710 --> 02:42:01,720
Musk and and he
 

6937
02:42:01,720 --> 02:42:03,349
Musk and and he
says

6938
02:42:03,349 --> 02:42:03,359
says
 

6939
02:42:03,359 --> 02:42:08,150
says
that uh you know China is quite serious

6940
02:42:08,150 --> 02:42:08,160
that uh you know China is quite serious
 

6941
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:11,150
that uh you know China is quite serious
about the one China policy and it seems

6942
02:42:11,150 --> 02:42:11,160
about the one China policy and it seems
 

6943
02:42:11,160 --> 02:42:14,269
about the one China policy and it seems
inevitable that Taiwan will have to be

6944
02:42:14,269 --> 02:42:14,279
inevitable that Taiwan will have to be
 

6945
02:42:14,279 --> 02:42:15,950
inevitable that Taiwan will have to be
if you look at this

6946
02:42:15,950 --> 02:42:15,960
if you look at this
 

6947
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:18,150
if you look at this
pragmatically in the 21st century it

6948
02:42:18,150 --> 02:42:18,160
pragmatically in the 21st century it
 

6949
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:19,670
pragmatically in the 21st century it
seems inevitable that Taiwan will have

6950
02:42:19,670 --> 02:42:19,680
seems inevitable that Taiwan will have
 

6951
02:42:19,680 --> 02:42:21,910
seems inevitable that Taiwan will have
to be a part of China and so we can get

6952
02:42:21,910 --> 02:42:21,920
to be a part of China and so we can get
 

6953
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:23,429
to be a part of China and so we can get
there either diplomatically or

6954
02:42:23,429 --> 02:42:23,439
there either diplomatically or
 

6955
02:42:23,439 --> 02:42:26,950
there either diplomatically or
militarily like

6956
02:42:26,950 --> 02:42:26,960
militarily like
 

6957
02:42:26,960 --> 02:42:29,510
militarily like
um what do you think about the

6958
02:42:29,510 --> 02:42:29,520
um what do you think about the
 

6959
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:31,910
um what do you think about the
inevitability of that kind of idea when

6960
02:42:31,910 --> 02:42:31,920
inevitability of that kind of idea when
 

6961
02:42:31,920 --> 02:42:34,349
inevitability of that kind of idea when
a nation says this is a top

6962
02:42:34,349 --> 02:42:34,359
a nation says this is a top
 

6963
02:42:34,359 --> 02:42:38,550
a nation says this is a top
priority for us

6964
02:42:38,550 --> 02:42:38,560
priority for us
 

6965
02:42:38,560 --> 02:42:42,670
priority for us
um what do you think about them meaning

6966
02:42:42,670 --> 02:42:42,680
um what do you think about them meaning
 

6967
02:42:42,680 --> 02:42:46,110
um what do you think about them meaning
it and what do we do about that

6968
02:42:46,110 --> 02:42:46,120
it and what do we do about that
 

6969
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:47,990
it and what do we do about that
there's no question it's a top priority

6970
02:42:47,990 --> 02:42:48,000
there's no question it's a top priority
 

6971
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:49,910
there's no question it's a top priority
for them and there's no question they

6972
02:42:49,910 --> 02:42:49,920
for them and there's no question they
 

6973
02:42:49,920 --> 02:42:52,990
for them and there's no question they
mean it but it's also a top priority for

6974
02:42:52,990 --> 02:42:53,000
mean it but it's also a top priority for
 

6975
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,349
mean it but it's also a top priority for
us not to let them take Taiwan why

6976
02:42:55,349 --> 02:42:55,359
us not to let them take Taiwan why
 

6977
02:42:55,359 --> 02:42:57,269
us not to let them take Taiwan why
exactly because it's an important

6978
02:42:57,269 --> 02:42:57,279
exactly because it's an important
 

6979
02:42:57,279 --> 02:42:59,670
exactly because it's an important
strategic asset uh many people will say

6980
02:42:59,670 --> 02:42:59,680
strategic asset uh many people will say
 

6981
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:02,469
strategic asset uh many people will say
it's because taiwan's a democracy but

6982
02:43:02,469 --> 02:43:02,479
it's because taiwan's a democracy but
 

6983
02:43:02,479 --> 02:43:04,269
it's because taiwan's a democracy but
that doesn't matter that

6984
02:43:04,269 --> 02:43:04,279
that doesn't matter that
 

6985
02:43:04,279 --> 02:43:06,349
that doesn't matter that
much uh it's

6986
02:43:06,349 --> 02:43:06,359
much uh it's
 

6987
02:43:06,359 --> 02:43:09,790
much uh it's
because uh of two strategic reasons the

6988
02:43:09,790 --> 02:43:09,800
because uh of two strategic reasons the
 

6989
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:13,230
because uh of two strategic reasons the
first is that uh if we were to let

6990
02:43:13,230 --> 02:43:13,240
first is that uh if we were to let
 

6991
02:43:13,240 --> 02:43:17,990
first is that uh if we were to let
Taiwan go it would have hugely negative

6992
02:43:17,990 --> 02:43:18,000
Taiwan go it would have hugely negative
 

6993
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,550
Taiwan go it would have hugely negative
consequences for our alliance structure

6994
02:43:20,550 --> 02:43:20,560
consequences for our alliance structure
 

6995
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:23,309
consequences for our alliance structure
in East Asia to contain China we need

6996
02:43:23,309 --> 02:43:23,319
in East Asia to contain China we need
 

6997
02:43:23,319 --> 02:43:26,269
in East Asia to contain China we need
allies we have an alliance structure and

6998
02:43:26,269 --> 02:43:26,279
allies we have an alliance structure and
 

6999
02:43:26,279 --> 02:43:29,030

Chinese attack us the American Amer an
 

7013
02:43:45,560 --> 02:43:49,269

won't be there for us uh so the it would

7014
02:43:49,269 --> 02:43:49,279
won't be there for us uh so the it would
 

7015
02:43:49,279 --> 02:43:50,670
won't be there for us uh so the it would
have

7016
02:43:50,670 --> 02:43:50,680
have
 

7017
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:53,510
have
uh a damaging effect on our allian

7018
02:43:53,510 --> 02:43:53,520
uh a damaging effect on our allian
 

7019
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:57,110
uh a damaging effect on our allian
structure which we cannot afford because

7020
02:43:57,110 --> 02:43:57,120
structure which we cannot afford because
 

7021
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:58,830
structure which we cannot afford because
because containing China is a wicked

7022
02:43:58,830 --> 02:43:58,840
because containing China is a wicked
 

7023
02:43:58,840 --> 02:44:01,030
because containing China is a wicked
problem it's a powerful State you were

7024
02:44:01,030 --> 02:44:01,040
problem it's a powerful State you were
 

7025
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:02,790
problem it's a powerful State you were
getting to this before when you talked

7026
02:44:02,790 --> 02:44:02,800
getting to this before when you talked
 

7027
02:44:02,800 --> 02:44:06,150
getting to this before when you talked
about China versus Taiwan so that's the

7028
02:44:06,150 --> 02:44:06,160
about China versus Taiwan so that's the
 

7029
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:08,710
about China versus Taiwan so that's the
first reason second reason is you want

7030
02:44:08,710 --> 02:44:08,720
first reason second reason is you want
 

7031
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:11,590
first reason second reason is you want
to bottle up the Chinese Navy and the

7032
02:44:11,590 --> 02:44:11,600
to bottle up the Chinese Navy and the
 

7033
02:44:11,600 --> 02:44:14,070
to bottle up the Chinese Navy and the
Chinese Air Force inside the first

Chinese Air Force inside the first
 

7035
02:44:14,080 --> 02:44:16,550
Chinese Air Force inside the first
island chain you don't want to let them

7036
02:44:16,550 --> 02:44:16,560
island chain you don't want to let them
 

7037
02:44:16,560 --> 02:44:17,309
island chain you don't want to let them
get

7038
02:44:17,309 --> 02:44:17,319
get
 

7039
02:44:17,319 --> 02:44:20,630
get
out uh into the Pacific you don't want

7040
02:44:20,630 --> 02:44:20,640
out uh into the Pacific you don't want
 

7041
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:23,710
out uh into the Pacific you don't want
them dominating the Waters of East Asia

7042
02:44:23,710 --> 02:44:23,720
them dominating the Waters of East Asia
 

7043
02:44:23,720 --> 02:44:25,469
them dominating the Waters of East Asia
you want to bottle them up again inside

7044
02:44:25,469 --> 02:44:25,479
you want to bottle them up again inside
 

7045
02:44:25,479 --> 02:44:27,349
you want to bottle them up again inside
the first island chain and you can only

7046
02:44:27,349 --> 02:44:27,359
the first island chain and you can only
 

7047
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:29,630
the first island chain and you can only
do that if you control Taiwan you don't

7048
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:29,640
do that if you control Taiwan you don't
 

7049
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:32,110
do that if you control Taiwan you don't
control Taiwan they get out into the

02:44:32,110 --> 02:44:32,120
control Taiwan they get out into the
 

7051
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:34,750
control Taiwan they get out into the
Philippine Sea into the Pacific and the

7114
02:45:55,230 --> 02:45:55,240
China to dominate the region so we have
 

7115
02:45:55,240 --> 02:45:58,349
China to dominate the region so we have
to contain it but at the same time and

7116

to contain it but at the same time and
 

7117

to contain it but at the same time and

only want to contain it we want to make
 

7121
02:46:02,319 --> 02:46:04,230
only want to contain it we want to make

sure we don't end up in a shooting match
 

7123
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:06,349
sure we don't end up in a shooting match
with the Chinese because this could be

7124
02:46:06,349 --> 02:46:06,359
with the Chinese because this could be
 

7125
02:46:06,359 --> 02:46:08,670
with the Chinese because this could be
disastrous so you have to have a very

7126
02:46:08,670 --> 02:46:08,680
disastrous so you have to have a very
 

7127
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:10,870
disastrous so you have to have a very
smart policy you have to build powerful

7128
02:46:10,870 --> 02:46:10,880
smart policy you have to build powerful
 

7129
02:46:10,880 --> 02:46:12,870
smart policy you have to build powerful
military forces and you have to make

7130
02:46:12,870 --> 02:46:12,880
military forces and you have to make
 

7131
02:46:12,880 --> 02:46:14,469
military forces and you have to make
sure you don't do anything that's

7132
02:46:14,469 --> 02:46:14,479
sure you don't do anything that's
 

7133
02:46:14,479 --> 02:46:17,910
sure you don't do anything that's
provocative netive on Taiwan for example

7134
02:46:17,910 --> 02:46:17,920
provocative netive on Taiwan for example
 

7135
02:46:17,920 --> 02:46:19,710
provocative netive on Taiwan for example
the last thing you want is for the

7136
02:46:19,710 --> 02:46:19,720
the last thing you want is for the
 

7137
02:46:19,720 --> 02:46:21,630
the last thing you want is for the
Taiwanese government to declare its

7138
02:46:21,630 --> 02:46:21,640
Taiwanese government to declare its
 

7139
02:46:21,640 --> 02:46:23,710
Taiwanese government to declare its
independence because the Chinese have

7140
02:46:23,710 --> 02:46:23,720
independence because the Chinese have
 

7141
02:46:23,720 --> 02:46:26,630
independence because the Chinese have
said if Taiwan does that we'll go to war

7142
02:46:26,630 --> 02:46:26,640
said if Taiwan does that we'll go to war
 

7143
02:46:26,640 --> 02:46:29,230
said if Taiwan does that we'll go to war
and of course we don't want that so my

7144
02:46:29,230 --> 02:46:29,240
and of course we don't want that so my
 

7145
02:46:29,240 --> 02:46:32,110
and of course we don't want that so my
view is you want to smartly build up

7146
02:46:32,110 --> 02:46:32,120
view is you want to smartly build up
 

7147
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:34,590
view is you want to smartly build up
your military forces and you want to do

7148
02:46:34,590 --> 02:46:34,600
your military forces and you want to do
 

7149
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:37,429
your military forces and you want to do
everything you can to contain China uh

7150
02:46:37,429 --> 02:46:37,439
everything you can to contain China uh
 

7151
02:46:37,439 --> 02:46:40,790
everything you can to contain China uh
and at the same time not be

7152
02:46:40,790 --> 02:46:40,800
and at the same time not be
 

7153
02:46:40,800 --> 02:46:43,790
and at the same time not be
provocative so a big component of that

7154
02:46:43,790 --> 02:46:43,800
provocative so a big component of that
 

7155
02:46:43,800 --> 02:46:45,590
provocative so a big component of that
is making

7156
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:45,600
is making
 

7157
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:47,910
is making
sure your military the US military is

7158
02:46:47,910 --> 02:46:47,920
sure your military the US military is
 

7159
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:50,670
sure your military the US military is
bigger than the Chinese

7160
02:46:50,670 --> 02:46:50,680
bigger than the Chinese
 

7161
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:54,389
bigger than the Chinese
military not necessarily uh it's an

7162
02:46:54,389 --> 02:46:54,399
military not necessarily uh it's an
 

7163
02:46:54,399 --> 02:46:55,990
military not necessarily uh it's an
interesting

7164
02:46:55,990 --> 02:46:56,000
interesting
 

7165
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:59,349
interesting
question uh a lot of people think that

7166
02:46:59,349 --> 02:46:59,359
question uh a lot of people think that
 

7167
02:46:59,359 --> 02:47:02,830
question uh a lot of people think that
to make deterrence work right you have

7168
02:47:02,830 --> 02:47:02,840
to make deterrence work right you have
 

7169
02:47:02,840 --> 02:47:05,790
to make deterrence work right you have
to be able to beat the Chinese and

7170
02:47:05,790 --> 02:47:05,800
to be able to beat the Chinese and
 

7171
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:08,110
to be able to beat the Chinese and
therefore you need a much bigger

7172
02:47:08,110 --> 02:47:08,120
therefore you need a much bigger
 

7173
02:47:08,120 --> 02:47:11,349
therefore you need a much bigger
military uh and I don't think over time

7174
02:47:11,349 --> 02:47:11,359
military uh and I don't think over time
 

7175
02:47:11,359 --> 02:47:13,510
military uh and I don't think over time
that's possible right I think it's

7176
02:47:13,510 --> 02:47:13,520
that's possible right I think it's
 

7177
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:15,469
that's possible right I think it's
probably not even possible now to beat

7178
02:47:15,469 --> 02:47:15,479
probably not even possible now to beat
 

7179
02:47:15,479 --> 02:47:19,349
probably not even possible now to beat
the Chinese in a war over Taiwan or in a

7180
02:47:19,349 --> 02:47:19,359
the Chinese in a war over Taiwan or in a
 

7181
02:47:19,359 --> 02:47:22,349
the Chinese in a war over Taiwan or in a
war in the South China Sea I think what

7182
02:47:22,349 --> 02:47:22,359
war in the South China Sea I think what
 

7183
02:47:22,359 --> 02:47:25,309
war in the South China Sea I think what
you want to do is make it clear to the

7184
02:47:25,309 --> 02:47:25,319
you want to do is make it clear to the
 

7185
02:47:25,319 --> 02:47:27,750
you want to do is make it clear to the
Chinese either that there will be no

7186
02:47:27,750 --> 02:47:27,760
Chinese either that there will be no
 

7187
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:29,389
Chinese either that there will be no
winner in other words you don't have to

7188
02:47:29,389 --> 02:47:29,399
winner in other words you don't have to
 

7189
02:47:29,399 --> 02:47:31,630
winner in other words you don't have to
win but you want to make sure they don't

7190
02:47:31,630 --> 02:47:31,640
win but you want to make sure they don't
 

7191
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:34,950
win but you want to make sure they don't
win okay it's it's it's a lose

7192
02:47:34,950 --> 02:47:34,960
win okay it's it's it's a lose
 

7193
02:47:34,960 --> 02:47:37,910
win okay it's it's it's a lose
lose U proposition if they go to war

7194
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:37,920
lose U proposition if they go to war
 

7195
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:40,830

7197
02:47:40,840 --> 02:47:43,070
over Taiwan or what have you uh and if
you can't do that right you think that

7198
02:47:43,070 --> 02:47:43,080
you can't do that right you think that
 

7199
02:47:43,080 --> 02:47:44,830
you can't do that right you think that
they're so powerful that they're

7200
02:47:44,830 --> 02:47:44,840
they're so powerful that they're
 

7201
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:46,990
they're so powerful that they're
ultimately going to win you want to

7202
02:47:46,990 --> 02:47:47,000
ultimately going to win you want to
 

7203
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,550
ultimately going to win you want to
convince them that Victory would be a

the Vietnam War right uh or you could

7368
02:51:25,229 --> 02:51:25,239
the Vietnam War right uh or you could
 

7369
02:51:25,239 --> 02:51:27,710
the Vietnam War right uh or you could
have a case where one of those

7370
02:51:27,710 --> 02:51:27,720
have a case where one of those
 

7371
02:51:27,720 --> 02:51:30,269
have a case where one of those
superpowers was involved in a war

7372
02:51:30,269 --> 02:51:30,279
superpowers was involved in a war
 

7373
02:51:30,279 --> 02:51:33,229
superpowers was involved in a war
against a proxy of the other superpower

7374
02:51:33,229 --> 02:51:33,239
against a proxy of the other superpower
 

7375
02:51:33,239 --> 02:51:35,190
against a proxy of the other superpower
Korean War think the Korean War the

7376
02:51:35,190 --> 02:51:35,200
Korean War think the Korean War the
 

7377
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:37,110
Korean War think the Korean War the
United States fought the Chinese who

7378
02:51:37,110 --> 02:51:37,120
United States fought the Chinese who
 

7379
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:39,510
United States fought the Chinese who
were allied with the Soviets at the time

7380
02:51:39,510 --> 02:51:39,520
were allied with the Soviets at the time
 

7381
02:51:39,520 --> 02:51:42,309
were allied with the Soviets at the time
mhm but uh a war between the United

7382
02:51:42,309 --> 02:51:42,319
mhm but uh a war between the United
 

7383
02:51:42,319 --> 02:51:45,150
mhm but uh a war between the United
States and China just like a war between

7384
02:51:45,150 --> 02:51:45,160
States and China just like a war between
 

7385
02:51:45,160 --> 02:51:47,750
States and China just like a war between
the United States and the Soviet Union

7386
02:51:47,750 --> 02:51:47,760
the United States and the Soviet Union
 

7387
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:49,229
the United States and the Soviet Union
during the Cold War that's what you

7388
02:51:49,229 --> 02:51:49,239
during the Cold War that's what you
 

7389
02:51:49,239 --> 02:51:51,750
during the Cold War that's what you
really want to avoid avoid so I think

7390
02:51:51,750 --> 02:51:51,760
really want to avoid avoid so I think
 

7391
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:53,630
really want to avoid avoid so I think
you'd have an intense security

7392
02:51:53,630 --> 02:51:53,640
you'd have an intense security
 

7393
02:51:53,640 --> 02:51:56,349
you'd have an intense security
competition right you'd have wars

7394
02:51:56,349 --> 02:51:56,359
competition right you'd have wars
 

7395
02:51:56,359 --> 02:52:00,389
competition right you'd have wars
involving proxies of each of those two

7396
02:52:00,389 --> 02:52:00,399
involving proxies of each of those two
 

7397
02:52:00,399 --> 02:52:02,590
involving proxies of each of those two
superpowers and you would probably have

7398
02:52:02,590 --> 02:52:02,600
superpowers and you would probably have
 

7399
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:04,750
superpowers and you would probably have
some Wars where one of the superpowers

7400
02:52:04,750 --> 02:52:04,760
some Wars where one of the superpowers
 

7401
02:52:04,760 --> 02:52:08,349
some Wars where one of the superpowers
was involved in a proxy right with the

7402
02:52:08,349 --> 02:52:08,359
was involved in a proxy right with the
 

7403
02:52:08,359 --> 02:52:10,309
was involved in a proxy right with the
other super one of the super other

7404
02:52:10,309 --> 02:52:10,319
other super one of the super other
 

7405
02:52:10,319 --> 02:52:13,150
other super one of the super other
superpowers proxies so it seems likely

7406
02:52:13,150 --> 02:52:13,160
superpowers proxies so it seems likely
 

7407
02:52:13,160 --> 02:52:15,030
superpowers proxies so it seems likely
then if that's the case then it would be

7408
02:52:15,030 --> 02:52:15,040
then if that's the case then it would be
 

7409
02:52:15,040 --> 02:52:19,150
then if that's the case then it would be
Taiwan is the proxy and us fighting

7410
02:52:19,150 --> 02:52:19,160
Taiwan is the proxy and us fighting
 

7411
02:52:19,160 --> 02:52:21,710
Taiwan is the proxy and us fighting
China through the proxy of Taiwan what

7412
02:52:21,710 --> 02:52:21,720
China through the proxy of Taiwan what
 

7413
02:52:21,720 --> 02:52:23,429
China through the proxy of Taiwan what
yeah well that would assume the United

7414
02:52:23,429 --> 02:52:23,439
yeah well that would assume the United
 

7415
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:25,550
yeah well that would assume the United
States but you want to remember you're

7416
02:52:25,550 --> 02:52:25,560
States but you want to remember you're
 

7417
02:52:25,560 --> 02:52:28,070
States but you want to remember you're
hypothesizing a situation where China

7418
02:52:28,070 --> 02:52:28,080
hypothesizing a situation where China
 

7419
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:31,190
hypothesizing a situation where China
dominates Asia oh already has dominated

7420
02:52:31,190 --> 02:52:31,200
dominates Asia oh already has dominated
 

7421
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:34,349
dominates Asia oh already has dominated
yes it's already dominated Taiwan uh I

7422
02:52:34,349 --> 02:52:34,359
yes it's already dominated Taiwan uh I
 

7423
02:52:34,359 --> 02:52:37,229
yes it's already dominated Taiwan uh I
see we we well where do you find the

7424
02:52:37,229 --> 02:52:37,239
see we we well where do you find the
 

7425
02:52:37,239 --> 02:52:40,110
see we we well where do you find the
proxies austr the Middle East could be a

7426
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:40,120
proxies austr the Middle East could be a
 

7427
02:52:40,120 --> 02:52:43,670
proxies austr the Middle East could be a
good case oh wow Persian Gulf right oh

7428
02:52:43,670 --> 02:52:43,680
good case oh wow Persian Gulf right oh
 

7429
02:52:43,680 --> 02:52:45,550
good case oh wow Persian Gulf right oh
boy and then our discussion of Israel

7430
02:52:45,550 --> 02:52:45,560
boy and then our discussion of Israel
 

7431
02:52:45,560 --> 02:52:48,150
boy and then our discussion of Israel
becomes even more dramatically yeah well

7432
02:52:48,150 --> 02:52:48,160
becomes even more dramatically yeah well
 

7433
02:52:48,160 --> 02:52:50,550
becomes even more dramatically yeah well
Israel Israel gets involved I think I

7434
02:52:50,550 --> 02:52:50,560
Israel Israel gets involved I think I
 

7435
02:52:50,560 --> 02:52:52,389
Israel Israel gets involved I think I
think in this scenario if you're talking

7436
02:52:52,389 --> 02:52:52,399
think in this scenario if you're talking
 

7437
02:52:52,399 --> 02:52:54,190
think in this scenario if you're talking
about a us China

7438
02:52:54,190 --> 02:52:54,200
about a us China
 

7439
02:52:54,200 --> 02:52:56,070
about a us China
competition right and you're talking

7440
02:52:56,070 --> 02:52:56,080
competition right and you're talking
 

7441
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:58,429
competition right and you're talking
about the Middle East I think it's the

7442
02:52:58,429 --> 02:52:58,439
about the Middle East I think it's the
 

7443
02:52:58,439 --> 02:53:01,309
about the Middle East I think it's the
gulf it's it's the Saudis the Iranians

7444
02:53:01,309 --> 02:53:01,319
gulf it's it's the Saudis the Iranians
 

7445
02:53:01,319 --> 02:53:03,469
gulf it's it's the Saudis the Iranians
the Iraqis it's the oil don't you think

7446
02:53:03,469 --> 02:53:03,479
the Iraqis it's the oil don't you think
 

7447
02:53:03,479 --> 02:53:07,670
the Iraqis it's the oil don't you think
it could be Israel versus Iran with

7448
02:53:07,670 --> 02:53:07,680
it could be Israel versus Iran with
 

7449
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:11,110
it could be Israel versus Iran with
some very 1984 kind of dramatic

7450
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:11,120
some very 1984 kind of dramatic
 

7451
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:14,110
some very 1984 kind of dramatic
Partnership of Iran Russia and China

7452
02:53:14,110 --> 02:53:14,120
Partnership of Iran Russia and China
 

7453
02:53:14,120 --> 02:53:17,670
Partnership of Iran Russia and China
versus is United States Europe and um

7454
02:53:17,670 --> 02:53:17,680
versus is United States Europe and um
 

7455
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:20,630
versus is United States Europe and um
Israel I think that's possible yeah I

7456
02:53:20,630 --> 02:53:20,640
Israel I think that's possible yeah I
 

7457
02:53:20,640 --> 02:53:23,110
Israel I think that's possible yeah I
think that's possible yeah now that I I

7458
02:53:23,110 --> 02:53:23,120
think that's possible yeah now that I I
 

7459
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:25,870
think that's possible yeah now that I I
mean I hadn't thought about it uh until

7460
02:53:25,870 --> 02:53:25,880
mean I hadn't thought about it uh until
 

7461
02:53:25,880 --> 02:53:27,670
mean I hadn't thought about it uh until
you said it but yeah I think that that

7462
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:27,680
you said it but yeah I think that that
 

7463
02:53:27,680 --> 02:53:30,870
you said it but yeah I think that that
that is possible is isn't that

7464
02:53:30,870 --> 02:53:30,880
that is possible is isn't that
 

7465
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:33,630
that is possible is isn't that
terrifying yeah well that you know in

7466
02:53:33,630 --> 02:53:33,640
terrifying yeah well that you know in
 

7467
02:53:33,640 --> 02:53:35,670
terrifying yeah well that you know in
your scenario where China already

7468
02:53:35,670 --> 02:53:35,680
your scenario where China already
 

7469
02:53:35,680 --> 02:53:37,710
your scenario where China already
dominates Asia and we dominate the

7470
02:53:37,710 --> 02:53:37,720
dominates Asia and we dominate the
 

7471
02:53:37,720 --> 02:53:40,870
dominates Asia and we dominate the
Western Hemisphere uh I think you start

7472
02:53:40,870 --> 02:53:40,880
Western Hemisphere uh I think you start
 

7473
02:53:40,880 --> 02:53:43,190
Western Hemisphere uh I think you start
talking about where the most likely

7474
02:53:43,190 --> 02:53:43,200
talking about where the most likely
 

7475
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:45,670
talking about where the most likely
places uh that the United States and

7476
02:53:45,670 --> 02:53:45,680
places uh that the United States and
 

7477
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:46,830
places uh that the United States and
China go

7478
02:53:46,830 --> 02:53:46,840
China go
 

7479
02:53:46,840 --> 02:53:50,150
China go
head-to-head or or fight through proxies

7480
02:53:50,150 --> 02:53:50,160
head-to-head or or fight through proxies
 

7481
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:52,269
head-to-head or or fight through proxies
uh I think it is the goal for the Middle

7482
02:53:52,269 --> 02:53:52,279
uh I think it is the goal for the Middle
 

7483
02:53:52,279 --> 02:53:55,710
uh I think it is the goal for the Middle
East and the scenario that you

7484
02:53:55,710 --> 02:53:55,720
East and the scenario that you
 

7485
02:53:55,720 --> 02:53:58,990
East and the scenario that you
posit I mean one one question I

7486
02:53:58,990 --> 02:53:59,000
posit I mean one one question I
 

7487
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:02,269
posit I mean one one question I
have I don't know about you but for me

7488
02:54:02,269 --> 02:54:02,279
have I don't know about you but for me
 

7489
02:54:02,279 --> 02:54:04,190
have I don't know about you but for me
unlike with the Soviet

7490
02:54:04,190 --> 02:54:04,200
unlike with the Soviet
 

7491
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:06,750
unlike with the Soviet
Union and I know I was born there but

7492
02:54:06,750 --> 02:54:06,760
Union and I know I was born there but
 

7493
02:54:06,760 --> 02:54:10,790
Union and I know I was born there but
even outside of that the cultural

7494
02:54:10,790 --> 02:54:10,800
even outside of that the cultural
 

7495
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:13,710
even outside of that the cultural
Gap the the the loss in Translation the

7496
02:54:13,710 --> 02:54:13,720
Gap the the the loss in Translation the
 

7497
02:54:13,720 --> 02:54:16,429
Gap the the the loss in Translation the
communication gap between China and the

7498
02:54:16,429 --> 02:54:16,439
communication gap between China and the
 

7499
02:54:16,439 --> 02:54:19,710
communication gap between China and the
United States seems to be much greater

7500
02:54:19,710 --> 02:54:19,720
United States seems to be much greater
 

7501
02:54:19,720 --> 02:54:22,190
United States seems to be much greater
than that of what was the former Soviet

7502
02:54:22,190 --> 02:54:22,200
than that of what was the former Soviet
 

7503
02:54:22,200 --> 02:54:24,429
than that of what was the former Soviet
Union and the United

7504
02:54:24,429 --> 02:54:24,439
Union and the United
 

7505
02:54:24,439 --> 02:54:28,670
Union and the United
States I see two cultures intermingling

7506
02:54:28,670 --> 02:54:28,680
States I see two cultures intermingling
 

7507
02:54:28,680 --> 02:54:30,830
States I see two cultures intermingling
and communicating as one of the ways to

7508
02:54:30,830 --> 02:54:30,840
and communicating as one of the ways to
 

7509
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:33,990
and communicating as one of the ways to
deescalate future

7510
02:54:33,990 --> 02:54:34,000
deescalate future
 

7511
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,710
deescalate future
conflict it's an interesting question I

7512
02:54:36,710 --> 02:54:36,720
conflict it's an interesting question I
 

7513
02:54:36,720 --> 02:54:39,309
conflict it's an interesting question I
mean it it is sort of an abstract

7514
02:54:39,309 --> 02:54:39,319
mean it it is sort of an abstract
 

7515
02:54:39,319 --> 02:54:42,790
mean it it is sort of an abstract
theoretical level my argument is that

7516
02:54:42,790 --> 02:54:42,800
theoretical level my argument is that
 

7517
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:46,110
theoretical level my argument is that
great Powers Act according to realist

7518
02:54:46,110 --> 02:54:46,120
great Powers Act according to realist
 

7519
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:48,510
great Powers Act according to realist
dictates and they understand those

7520
02:54:48,510 --> 02:54:48,520
dictates and they understand those
 

7521
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:52,750
dictates and they understand those
realist dictates and uh that can lead to

7522
02:54:52,750 --> 02:54:52,760
realist dictates and uh that can lead to
 

7523
02:54:52,760 --> 02:54:57,550
realist dictates and uh that can lead to
cooperation or it can lead to uh War uh

02:55:21,510 --> 02:55:21,520
actually don't believe that I I believe
 

7541
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:25,269
actually don't believe that I I believe
the Soviets were uh realists to the core

7542
02:55:25,269 --> 02:55:25,279
the Soviets were uh realists to the core
 

7543
02:55:25,279 --> 02:55:28,750
the Soviets were uh realists to the core
uh I believe Stalin was a realist par

7544
02:55:28,750 --> 02:55:28,760
uh I believe Stalin was a realist par
 

7545
02:55:28,760 --> 02:55:31,630
uh I believe Stalin was a realist par
Excellence uh and that ideology did not

7546
02:55:31,630 --> 02:55:31,640
Excellence uh and that ideology did not
 

7547
02:55:31,640 --> 02:55:34,870
Excellence uh and that ideology did not
matter much in Stalin's foreign policy

7548
02:55:34,870 --> 02:55:34,880
matter much in Stalin's foreign policy
 

7549
02:55:34,880 --> 02:55:36,309
matter much in Stalin's foreign policy
and I believe if you look at Soviet

7550
02:55:36,309 --> 02:55:36,319
and I believe if you look at Soviet
 

7551
02:55:36,319 --> 02:55:38,910
and I believe if you look at Soviet
foreign policy uh after World War II you

7552
02:55:38,910 --> 02:55:38,920
foreign policy uh after World War II you
 

7553
02:55:38,920 --> 02:55:40,790
foreign policy uh after World War II you
know throughout the Cold War they were

7554
02:55:40,790 --> 02:55:40,800
know throughout the Cold War they were
 

7555
02:55:40,800 --> 02:55:44,950
know throughout the Cold War they were
realists to the core uh and uh and I

7556
02:55:44,950 --> 02:55:44,960
realists to the core uh and uh and I
 

7557
02:55:44,960 --> 02:55:46,830
realists to the core uh and uh and I
think in those days the Americans were

7558
02:55:46,830 --> 02:55:46,840
think in those days the Americans were
 

7559
02:55:46,840 --> 02:55:49,670
think in those days the Americans were
realists right uh a lot of liberal

7560
02:55:49,670 --> 02:55:49,680
realists right uh a lot of liberal
 

7561
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:51,830
realists right uh a lot of liberal
ideology floating around out there but

7562
02:55:51,830 --> 02:55:51,840
ideology floating around out there but
 

7563
02:55:51,840 --> 02:55:53,630
ideology floating around out there but
the Americans were realists and I think

7564
02:55:53,630 --> 02:55:53,640
the Americans were realists and I think
 

7565
02:55:53,640 --> 02:55:56,309
the Americans were realists and I think
one of the reasons you avoided a

7566
02:55:56,309 --> 02:55:56,319
one of the reasons you avoided a
 

7567
02:55:56,319 --> 02:55:58,269
one of the reasons you avoided a
shooting match between the United States

7568
02:55:58,269 --> 02:55:58,279
shooting match between the United States
 

7569
02:55:58,279 --> 02:56:02,510
shooting match between the United States
and the Soviet Union from 47 to uh

7570
02:56:02,510 --> 02:56:02,520
and the Soviet Union from 47 to uh
 

7571
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:06,269
and the Soviet Union from 47 to uh
89 uh was because both sides I think uh

7572
02:56:06,269 --> 02:56:06,279
89 uh was because both sides I think uh
 

7573
02:56:06,279 --> 02:56:08,990
89 uh was because both sides I think uh
understood basic balance of power

7574
02:56:08,990 --> 02:56:09,000
understood basic balance of power
 

7575
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:13,110

02:56:48,389 --> 02:56:48,399
just going back to our discussion of
 

7605
02:56:48,399 --> 02:56:51,990
just going back to our discussion of
NATO expansion I think our inability to

thinking and it's gone away somewhat
 

7639
02:57:30,200 --> 02:57:32,630
thinking and it's gone away somewhat
since we've moved into multipolarity but

7640
02:57:32,630 --> 02:57:32,640
since we've moved into multipolarity but

completely and uh this makes me a little
 

7645
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:39,070
completely and uh this makes me a little
nervous right to pick up on your point I

uncertainty of potential conflict so you
 

7761
02:59:59,399 --> 03:00:00,830
uncertainty of potential conflict so you
want to avoid the uncertainty of

to empathize you want to be able to put
 

7769
03:00:07,920 --> 03:00:10,309
to empathize you want to be able to put
yourself in the shoes of the other side

7770
03:00:10,309 --> 03:00:10,319
yourself in the shoes of the other side
 

7771
03:00:10,319 --> 03:00:13,429
yourself in the shoes of the other side
yes I agree 100% but with that right

7772
03:00:13,429 --> 03:00:13,439
yes I agree 100% but with that right
 

7773
03:00:13,439 --> 03:00:15,110
yes I agree 100% but with that right
it's very important if you're a first

7774
03:00:15,110 --> 03:00:15,120
it's very important if you're a first
 

7775
03:00:15,120 --> 03:00:17,670
it's very important if you're a first
class strategist to be able to do that

7776
03:00:17,670 --> 03:00:17,680
class strategist to be able to do that
 

7777
03:00:17,680 --> 03:00:19,349
class strategist to be able to do that
but at the same time there is this

7778
03:00:19,349 --> 03:00:19,359
but at the same time there is this
 

7779
03:00:19,359 --> 03:00:22,550
but at the same time there is this
competition for power taking place and

7780
03:00:22,550 --> 03:00:22,560
competition for power taking place and
 

7781
03:00:22,560 --> 03:00:24,870
competition for power taking place and
what you want to do is maximize how much

7782
03:00:24,870 --> 03:00:24,880
what you want to do is maximize how much
 

7783
03:00:24,880 --> 03:00:27,030
what you want to do is maximize how much
power you have relative to the other

7784
03:00:27,030 --> 03:00:27,040
power you have relative to the other
 

7785
03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:28,830
power you have relative to the other
side and the other side wants to

7786
03:00:28,830 --> 03:00:28,840
side and the other side wants to
 

7787
03:00:28,840 --> 03:00:31,349
side and the other side wants to
maximize how much power it has relative

7788
03:00:31,349 --> 03:00:31,359
maximize how much power it has relative
 

7789
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:34,229
maximize how much power it has relative
to you so you have this competition for

7790
03:00:34,229 --> 03:00:34,239
to you so you have this competition for
 

7791
03:00:34,239 --> 03:00:38,870
to you so you have this competition for
power right uh that's taking place all

7792
03:00:38,870 --> 03:00:38,880
power right uh that's taking place all
 

7793
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:41,630
power right uh that's taking place all
the time and that's taking place at the

7794
03:00:41,630 --> 03:00:41,640
the time and that's taking place at the
 

7795
03:00:41,640 --> 03:00:43,389
the time and that's taking place at the
same time you want to have empathy or

7796
03:00:43,389 --> 03:00:43,399
same time you want to have empathy or
 

7797
03:00:43,399 --> 03:00:44,630
same time you want to have empathy or
you want to be able to put yourself in

7798
03:00:44,630 --> 03:00:44,640
you want to be able to put yourself in
 

7799
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:47,349
you want to be able to put yourself in
the shoes of the other side so those two

7800
03:00:47,349 --> 03:00:47,359
the shoes of the other side so those two
 

7801
03:00:47,359 --> 03:00:49,790
the shoes of the other side so those two
things kind of go together right it just

7802
03:00:49,790 --> 03:00:49,800
things kind of go together right it just
 

7803
03:00:49,800 --> 03:00:53,469
things kind of go together right it just
feels less threatening to build up your

7804
03:00:53,469 --> 03:00:53,479
feels less threatening to build up your
 

7805
03:00:53,479 --> 03:00:57,070
feels less threatening to build up your
thing versus try to hurt the other

7806

world
 

8003
03:05:14,200 --> 03:05:17,910
world
uh into sort of a giant sphere of

8004
03:05:17,910 --> 03:05:17,920
uh into sort of a giant sphere of
 

8005
03:05:17,920 --> 03:05:20,510
uh into sort of a giant sphere of
influence without

03:05:22,950 --> 03:05:22,960
incorporating those
 

8009
03:05:22,960 --> 03:05:25,790
incorporating those
territories actually into the state

8010
03:05:25,790 --> 03:05:25,800
territories actually into the state
 

8011
03:05:25,800 --> 03:05:27,950
territories actually into the state
itself so you had this thing called the

03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:31,469
itself so you had this thing called the
British Empire and it controlled areas

British Empire and it controlled areas
 

8015

8017
03:05:32,640 --> 03:05:36,110
like
India uh uh North

03:05:43,790 --> 03:05:43,800
couple instances at different points
 

8023
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:45,910
couple instances at different points
Singapore would be another example

8024
03:05:45,910 --> 03:05:45,920
Singapore would be another example
 

8025
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:48,870
Singapore would be another example
Australia would be another example so

8026
03:05:48,870 --> 03:05:48,880
Australia would be another example so
 

8027
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:51,950
Australia would be another example so
these were all entities that were part

Philippines and Cuba and Puerto Rico but

8038
03:06:08,990 --> 03:06:09,000
Philippines and Cuba and Puerto Rico but
 

8039
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,389
Philippines and Cuba and Puerto Rico but
we never got serious about it there's

8040
03:06:11,389 --> 03:06:11,399
we never got serious about it there's
 

8041
03:06:11,399 --> 03:06:13,510
we never got serious about it there's
never been an American Empire this is

not to say the United States is not an

03:06:15,469 --> 03:06:15,479
not to say the United States is not an
 

8045
03:06:15,479 --> 03:06:17,630
not to say the United States is not an
incredibly powerful country that goes

8046
03:06:17,630 --> 03:06:17,640
incredibly powerful country that goes
 

8047
03:06:17,640 --> 03:06:19,910
incredibly powerful country that goes
all around the world building military

8048
03:06:19,910 --> 03:06:19,920
all around the world building military
 

8049
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:22,670
all around the world building military
bases and stationing troops Here There

8050
03:06:22,670 --> 03:06:22,680
bases and stationing troops Here There
 

8051
03:06:22,680 --> 03:06:25,550
bases and stationing troops Here There
and Everywhere but we're not running an

8052
03:06:25,550 --> 03:06:25,560
and Everywhere but we're not running an
 

8053
03:06:25,560 --> 03:06:28,469
and Everywhere but we're not running an
Empire the way the British Empire was

8054
03:06:28,469 --> 03:06:28,479
Empire the way the British Empire was
 

8055
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:30,349
Empire the way the British Empire was
run or the French

8056
03:06:30,349 --> 03:06:30,359
run or the French
 

8057
03:06:30,359 --> 03:06:34,190
run or the French
Empire uh so the question for me is why

8058
03:06:34,190 --> 03:06:34,200
Empire uh so the question for me is why
 

8059
03:06:34,200 --> 03:06:37,630
Empire uh so the question for me is why
did those Empires go away the why' the

8060
03:06:37,630 --> 03:06:37,640
did those Empires go away the why' the
 

8061
03:06:37,640 --> 03:06:39,590
did those Empires go away the why' the
British Empire go away if you ever look

8062
03:06:39,590 --> 03:06:39,600
British Empire go away if you ever look
 

8063
03:06:39,600 --> 03:06:43,550
British Empire go away if you ever look
at a map of the world in 1922 after

8064
03:06:43,550 --> 03:06:43,560
at a map of the world in 1922 after
 

8065
03:06:43,560 --> 03:06:46,510
at a map of the world in 1922 after
World War I it's truly amazing how much

8066
03:06:46,510 --> 03:06:46,520
World War I it's truly amazing how much
 

8067
03:06:46,520 --> 03:06:49,590
World War I it's truly amazing how much
of that map is controlled by Britain

8068
03:06:49,590 --> 03:06:49,600
of that map is controlled by Britain
 

8069
03:06:49,600 --> 03:06:52,229
of that map is controlled by Britain
right they had a huge Empire and it's

8070
03:06:52,229 --> 03:06:52,239
right they had a huge Empire and it's
 

8071
03:06:52,239 --> 03:06:55,190
right they had a huge Empire and it's
disappeared probably by far the biggest

8072
03:06:55,190 --> 03:06:55,200
disappeared probably by far the biggest
 

8073
03:06:55,200 --> 03:06:57,710
disappeared probably by far the biggest
in terms of area Empire in human history

8074
03:06:57,710 --> 03:06:57,720
in terms of area Empire in human history
 

8075
03:06:57,720 --> 03:07:00,590
in terms of area Empire in human history
I think so I think that's right it

8076
03:07:00,590 --> 03:07:00,600
I think so I think that's right it
 

8077
03:07:00,600 --> 03:07:03,389
I think so I think that's right it
almost has to be yeah right right uh

8078
03:07:03,389 --> 03:07:03,399
almost has to be yeah right right uh
 

8079
03:07:03,399 --> 03:07:05,670
almost has to be yeah right right uh
it's crazy crazy yeah it's and then no

8080
03:07:05,670 --> 03:07:05,680
it's crazy crazy yeah it's and then no
 

8081
03:07:05,680 --> 03:07:08,630
it's crazy crazy yeah it's and then no
longer no longer is the case yeah now I

8082
03:07:08,630 --> 03:07:08,640
longer no longer is the case yeah now I
 

8083
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:10,550
longer no longer is the case yeah now I
I'm going be clear the the Americans

8084
03:07:10,550 --> 03:07:10,560
I'm going be clear the the Americans
 

8085
03:07:10,560 --> 03:07:11,670
I'm going be clear the the Americans
have

8086
03:07:11,670 --> 03:07:11,680
have
 

8087
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:14,229
have
wielded maybe even greater influence

8088
03:07:14,229 --> 03:07:14,239
wielded maybe even greater influence
 

8089
03:07:14,239 --> 03:07:16,150
wielded maybe even greater influence
than Britain did when it had its Empire

8090
03:07:16,150 --> 03:07:16,160
than Britain did when it had its Empire
 

8091
03:07:16,160 --> 03:07:17,830
than Britain did when it had its Empire
but I don't believe we have an Empire

8092
03:07:17,830 --> 03:07:17,840
but I don't believe we have an Empire
 

8093
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:19,670
but I don't believe we have an Empire
that bears any resemblance to the

8094
03:07:19,670 --> 03:07:19,680
that bears any resemblance to the
 

8095
03:07:19,680 --> 03:07:21,110
that bears any resemblance to the
British
