succeed you mentioned Fincher likes to

716
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
succeed you mentioned Fincher likes to
 

717
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,069
succeed you mentioned Fincher likes to
do a lot of takes that's the the famous

718
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:27,079
do a lot of takes that's the the famous

721
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,949
thing about David Fincher
so what are the pros and cons of that I

722
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:31,959
so what are the pros and cons of that I
 

723
00:16:31,959 --> 00:16:33,670
so what are the pros and cons of that I
think I I read that he

724
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
think I I read that he
 

725
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,870
think I I read that he
does some crazy amount he averages 25 to

726
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
does some crazy amount he averages 25 to
 

727
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,389
does some crazy amount he averages 25 to
65 uh takes and most directors do less

728
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
65 uh takes and most directors do less
 

729
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:43,110
65 uh takes and most directors do less
than

730
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,120
than
 

731
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,030
than
10 so yeah sometimes it's timing

732
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:47,040
10 so yeah sometimes it's timing
 

733
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,710
10 so yeah sometimes it's timing
sometimes it's literally he has a

00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
sometimes it's literally he has a
 

735
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,309
sometimes it's literally he has a
stopwatch and he's he's timing how long

736
00:16:51,309 --> 00:16:51,319
stopwatch and he's he's timing how long
 

737
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,389
stopwatch and he's he's timing how long
a scene is taking and then he'll

738
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:55,399
a scene is taking and then he'll
 

739
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,910
a scene is taking and then he'll
say you need to take a minute off this

let's take let's see if we can take a
 

751
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,870

755
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,390

think I think because Fincher hates

756
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400

 

757
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,350

Indulgence and he wants he wants people

Indulgence and he wants he wants people
 

759
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,590
Indulgence and he wants he wants people
to talk the way they do in

760
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600

the film
was

2622

2633
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,029
were unexpected and and uh and I think
that

2634
00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:21,039
that
 

2635
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,870

said it was actually a moment of
 

2905
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,910
said it was actually a moment of
incredible confidence because he said

2906
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:38,920
incredible confidence because he said
 

2907
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,750
incredible confidence because he said
the worst thing that could possibly have

2908
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:40,760
the worst thing that could possibly have
 

2909
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,710
the worst thing that could possibly have
happened happened in my first two days

2910
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:43,720
happened happened in my first two days
 

2911
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,029
happened happened in my first two days
and after

2912
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:45,039
and after
 

2913
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,870
and after
that I was like I know what I'm doing

2914
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:47,880
that I was like I know what I'm doing
 

2915
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,430
that I was like I know what I'm doing
and I knew I had to reshoot it and it

2916
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:49,440
and I knew I had to reshoot it and it
 

2917
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,950
and I knew I had to reshoot it and it
was absolutely right and I guess that's

2918
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:51,960
was absolutely right and I guess that's
 

2919
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,549
was absolutely right and I guess that's
what a great director must do is have

01:19:49,629 --> 01:19:49,639
stories and so that adds to the
 

3561
01:19:49,639 --> 01:19:51,470
stories and so that adds to the
complexity I wouldn't say it's a power

3562
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:51,480
complexity I wouldn't say it's a power

literally would watch them start to re
 

4211
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,629
literally would watch them start to re
reverse their having had such a great

4212
01:34:35,629 --> 01:34:35,639

01:34:42,709 --> 01:34:42,719
acts I thought this is going to happen
 

4219
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:48,950
acts I thought this is going to happen
in this show if this um

4220
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:48,960

 

4221
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,470

intimacy can actually land

4222
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:54,480

 

4223
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,790

um and I think just think there was some

4224
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:56,800
um and I think just think there was some
 

4225
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,109
um and I think just think there was some
brilliant writing and we always

4226
01:34:59,109 --> 01:34:59,119
brilliant writing and we always
 

4227
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:02,109
brilliant writing and we always
attempted to do it in one take no matter

4228
01:35:02,109 --> 01:35:02,119
attempted to do it in one take no matter
 

4229
01:35:02,119 --> 01:35:03,590
attempted to do it in one take no matter
how long something was we would try to

4230
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:03,600
how long something was we would try to
 

4231
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,669
how long something was we would try to
do it in one take the direct

4232
01:35:05,669 --> 01:35:05,679
do it in one take the direct
 

4233
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:09,149
do it in one take the direct
addresses so there was never a cut when

4234
01:35:09,149 --> 01:35:09,159
addresses so there was never a cut when
 

4235
01:35:09,159 --> 01:35:10,950
addresses so there was never a cut when
we went on a locations we started to

4236
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:10,960
we went on a locations we started to
 

4237
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,830
we went on a locations we started to
then find ways to cut it and make it

4238
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:14,840
then find ways to cut it and make it
 

4239
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,030
then find ways to cut it and make it
slightly broader but that's interesting

4240
01:35:17,030 --> 01:35:17,040
slightly broader but that's interesting
 

4241
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,629
slightly broader but that's interesting
cuz you're you're doing a bunch of with

4242
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:18,639
cuz you're you're doing a bunch of with
 

4243
01:35:18,639 --> 01:35:20,669
cuz you're you're doing a bunch of with
both Richard third and Frank Underwood a

4244
01:35:20,669 --> 01:35:20,679
both Richard third and Frank Underwood a
 

4245
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:21,629
both Richard third and Frank Underwood a
bunch

4246
01:35:21,629 --> 01:35:21,639
bunch
 

4247
01:35:21,639 --> 01:35:26,310
bunch
of dark borderline evil things and then

4248
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:26,320
of dark borderline evil things and then
 

4249
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,030
of dark borderline evil things and then
I guess the idea is you're going to be

4250
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:28,040
I guess the idea is you're going to be
 

4251
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:29,550
I guess the idea is you're going to be
losing the audience and then you win

4252
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:29,560
losing the audience and then you win
 

4253
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:32,629
losing the audience and then you win
them back over with the addresses that's

4254
01:35:32,629 --> 01:35:32,639
them back over with the addresses that's
 

4255
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:34,790
them back over with the addresses that's
the remarkable thing is

4256
