00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,350
you decided this is worth working on and
it's not just a problem that will be

it's not just a problem that will be
 

329
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,950
it's not just a problem that will be
solved by an smarter model because

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
solved by an smarter model because
 

331
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,270
solved by an smarter model because
there's so many other things to do on

but first zoom out once again so
 

345
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,070
but first zoom out once again so
fundamentally it's about search you said

353
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,869

about search first so you think of

about search first so you think of
 

355
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,869
about search first so you think of
perplexity as a search engine MH I think

perplexity as a search engine MH I think
 

357
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,390
perplexity as a search engine MH I think
of perplexity as a knowledge discovery

good enough or the answer was good
 

377
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,189
good enough or the answer was good
enough but you probably want to dig

enough but you probably want to dig
 

379
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,350

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,430
more
and that's why in in the search bar we

384
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
and that's why in in the search bar we
 

385
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,710
and that's why in in the search bar we
say where knowledge begins because

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:04,959
me five little pieces of information
 

661
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,230
me five little pieces of information
around that M maybe the weather today

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,000
and maybe uh other links to say do you
 

665
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,230
and maybe uh other links to say do you
want hourly and maybe it gives a little

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
want hourly and maybe it gives a little
 

667
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,949
want hourly and maybe it gives a little
extra information about rain and

extra information about rain and
 

669
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,110
extra information about rain and
temperature all that kind of stuff yeah

when you ask for weather uh let's say it

674
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
when you ask for weather uh let's say it
 

675
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,750
when you ask for weather uh let's say it
localizes you to Austin automatically

676
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
localizes you to Austin automatically
 

677
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,110
localizes you to Austin automatically
and not just tell you it's hot not just

678
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,120
and not just tell you it's hot not just
 

679
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,710
and not just tell you it's hot not just
tell you it's humid

680
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:29,720
tell you it's humid
 

681
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,590
tell you it's humid
but also tells you what to

682
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
but also tells you what to
 

683
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,710
but also tells you what to
wear you you wouldn't ask for what to

684
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:33,720
wear you you wouldn't ask for what to
 

685
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,829
wear you you wouldn't ask for what to
wear but it would be amazing If the

686
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
wear but it would be amazing If the
 

687
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,870
wear but it would be amazing If the
product came and told you what to wear

688
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:37,880
product came and told you what to wear
 

689

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:40,720
how much of that could be made much more
 

691
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,509
how much of that could be made much more
powerful with some memory with some

personalization a lot more definitely I

694
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:45,760
personalization a lot more definitely I
 

695
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,550
personalization a lot more definitely I
mean but the personalization there's an

696
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:47,560
mean but the personalization there's an
 

697
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,829

8020 here the 8020 is
 

699
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:53,110
8020 here the 8020 is
achieved uh

700
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
achieved uh
 

701
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,069
achieved uh
with your

702
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
with your
 

703
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,230
with your
location let's say your Cher

704
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,240
location let's say your Cher
 

705
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,030
location let's say your Cher
and then you know like like sites you

706
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,040
and then you know like like sites you
 

707
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,590
and then you know like like sites you
typically go to like a rough sense of

708
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:04,600
typically go to like a rough sense of
 

709
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,749
typically go to like a rough sense of
topics of what you're interested in all

710
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:06,759
topics of what you're interested in all
 

711
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,350
topics of what you're interested in all
that can already give you a great

712
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,360
that can already give you a great
 

713
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,550
that can already give you a great
personalized experience mhm it doesn't

have to like have infinite

716
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,160
have to like have infinite
 

717
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,069
have to like have infinite
memory infinite context Windows have

718
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
memory infinite context Windows have
 

719
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,710
memory infinite context Windows have
access to every single activity you've

720
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:17,720
access to every single activity you've
 

721
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,870
access to every single activity you've
done that's an Overkill yeah yeah I mean

722
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
done that's an Overkill yeah yeah I mean
 

723
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,670
done that's an Overkill yeah yeah I mean
humans are creatures of habit most of

724
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:22,680
humans are creatures of habit most of
 

725
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,829
humans are creatures of habit most of
the time we do the same thing and yeah

726
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:24,839
the time we do the same thing and yeah
 

727
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,189
the time we do the same thing and yeah
it's like first few principal vectors

728
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:28,199
it's like first few principal vectors
 

729
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:30,269
it's like first few principal vectors
first few principal first like most most

730
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:30,279
first few principal first like most most
 

731
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:33,710
first few principal first like most most
important IG vectors yes yeah thank you

732
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:33,720
important IG vectors yes yeah thank you
 

733
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,269
important IG vectors yes yeah thank you
for introducing humans to that into the

734
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:36,279
for introducing humans to that into the
 

735
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,389
for introducing humans to that into the
most important igon vectors right but

736
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
most important igon vectors right but
 

737
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,230
most important igon vectors right but
like for me usually I check the weather

738
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
like for me usually I check the weather
 

739
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,110
like for me usually I check the weather
if I'm going running so it's important

740
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,120
if I'm going running so it's important
 

741
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,350
if I'm going running so it's important
for the system to know that running is

742
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:44,360
for the system to know that running is
 

743
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,949
for the system to know that running is
an activity I do but also depends on

744
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:47,959
an activity I do but also depends on
 

745
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,350
an activity I do but also depends on
like you know when you when you run like

746
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
like you know when you when you run like
 

747
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,509
like you know when you when you run like
if you're asking in the night maybe

748
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:50,519
if you're asking in the night maybe
 

749
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,949
if you're asking in the night maybe
you're not looking for running but right

750
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959
you're not looking for running but right
 

751
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,430
you're not looking for running but right
but then that that starts to get into

752
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:54,440
but then that that starts to get into
 

753
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,790
but then that that starts to get into
details really I never ask a night

754
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:56,800
details really I never ask a night
 

755
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,509
details really I never ask a night
because I don't care so like usually

756
00:14:58,509 --> 00:14:58,519
because I don't care so like usually
 

757
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,949
because I don't care so like usually
it's always going going to be running

758
00:14:59,949 --> 00:14:59,959
it's always going going to be running
 

759
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,389
it's always going going to be running
about running and even at night it's

760
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:01,399
about running and even at night it's
 

761
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,629
about running and even at night it's
going to be about running cuz I love

762
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
going to be about running cuz I love
 

763
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,470
going to be about running cuz I love
running at night uh let me zoom out once

764
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:05,480
running at night uh let me zoom out once
 

765
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,150
running at night uh let me zoom out once
again Ask a similar I guess question

766
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:07,160
again Ask a similar I guess question
 

767
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,710
again Ask a similar I guess question
that we just asked

768
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
that we just asked
 

769
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,749
that we just asked
perplexity can you can perplexity take

770
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:11,759
perplexity can you can perplexity take
 

771
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,269
perplexity can you can perplexity take
on and beat Google or bang in search so

772
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:16,279
on and beat Google or bang in search so
 

773
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,870
on and beat Google or bang in search so
we do not have to beat them neither do

774
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
we do not have to beat them neither do
 

775
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,350
we do not have to beat them neither do
we have to take them on in fact I feel

776
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,360
we have to take them on in fact I feel
 

777
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,269
we have to take them on in fact I feel
the primary difference of perplexity

778
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:24,279
the primary difference of perplexity
 

779
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,430
the primary difference of perplexity
from other startups that have

780
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:26,440
from other startups that have
 

781
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,470
from other startups that have
explicitly uh laid out that they're

782
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
explicitly uh laid out that they're
 

783
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,269
explicitly uh laid out that they're
taking on Google is that we never even

784
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
taking on Google is that we never even
 

785
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,030
taking on Google is that we never even
tried to play Google at their own

786
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,040
tried to play Google at their own
 

787
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,670
tried to play Google at their own
game um if you're just trying to take on

788
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:36,680
game um if you're just trying to take on
 

789
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,389
game um if you're just trying to take on
Google by building another timling

790
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
Google by building another timling
 

791
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,749
Google by building another timling
search engine and with some other

792
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:41,759
search engine and with some other
 

793
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,870
search engine and with some other
differentiation which could be privacy

794
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:43,880
differentiation which could be privacy
 

795
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,870
differentiation which could be privacy
or or um no ads or something like that

796
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
or or um no ads or something like that
 

797
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,749
or or um no ads or something like that
it's not enough and it's very hard to

798
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:50,759
it's not enough and it's very hard to
 

799
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,470
it's not enough and it's very hard to
make a real difference in just making a

800
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
make a real difference in just making a
 

801
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,350
make a real difference in just making a
better 10bl link search engine than

802
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:56,360
better 10bl link search engine than
 

803
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,309
better 10bl link search engine than
Google because they have basically

perplexity there was a healthy debate

818
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:20,279
perplexity there was a healthy debate
 

819
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,990
perplexity there was a healthy debate
about whether we should still show the

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,000
about whether we should still show the
 

821
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,230
about whether we should still show the

of course there still going to be a

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:11,400
of course there still going to be a
 

865
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,909
of course there still going to be a
longtail of hallucinations like you can

866
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:12,919
longtail of hallucinations like you can

always find some queries that perplexity

868
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
always find some queries that perplexity
 

869
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,870
always find some queries that perplexity
is hallucinating on but it'll get harder

870
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:17,880
is hallucinating on but it'll get harder
 

871
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,350
is hallucinating on but it'll get harder
and harder to find those queries and so

872
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:20,360
and harder to find those queries and so
 

873
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,470
and harder to find those queries and so
we made a bet that this technolog is

874
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:22,480
we made a bet that this technolog is
 

875
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,630
we made a bet that this technolog is
going to exponentially improve and get

876
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:25,640
going to exponentially improve and get
 

877
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,950
going to exponentially improve and get
cheaper and so we would rather take a

878
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
cheaper and so we would rather take a
 

879
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,630
cheaper and so we would rather take a
more dramatic position that the best way

880
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:31,640
more dramatic position that the best way
 

881
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,510
more dramatic position that the best way
to like actually make a dent in the

882
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
to like actually make a dent in the
 

883
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,310
to like actually make a dent in the
search space is to not try to do what

884
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:35,320
search space is to not try to do what
 

885
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,029
search space is to not try to do what
Google does but try to do something they

886
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
Google does but try to do something they
 

887
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,909
Google does but try to do something they
don't want to do to for them to do this

888
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
don't want to do to for them to do this
 

889
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,990
don't want to do to for them to do this
for every single query is a lot of lot

890
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
for every single query is a lot of lot
 

891
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,750
for every single query is a lot of lot
of money to be spent because their

892
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:43,760
of money to be spent because their
 

893
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,390
of money to be spent because their
search volume is so much higher so let's

894
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
search volume is so much higher so let's
 

895
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,070
search volume is so much higher so let's
maybe talk about the business model of

896
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,080
maybe talk about the business model of
 

897
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,710
maybe talk about the business model of
Google

898
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:49,720
Google
 

899
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,710
Google
mhm one of the biggest ways they make

900
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
mhm one of the biggest ways they make
 

901
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,070
mhm one of the biggest ways they make
money is by showing ads yeah as part of

902
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
money is by showing ads yeah as part of
 

903
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,590
money is by showing ads yeah as part of
the 10

904
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
the 10
 

905
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,149
the 10
links so so uh can maybe explain your

906
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:02,159
links so so uh can maybe explain your
 

907
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,830
links so so uh can maybe explain your
understanding of that business model and

908
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:03,840
understanding of that business model and
 

909
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,590
understanding of that business model and
why that uh doesn't work for perplexity

910
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:07,600
why that uh doesn't work for perplexity
 

911
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,870
why that uh doesn't work for perplexity
yeah so before I explain the Google

912
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:09,880
yeah so before I explain the Google
 

913
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,070
yeah so before I explain the Google
AdWords model uh let me start with a

914
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,080
AdWords model uh let me start with a
 

915
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,710
AdWords model uh let me start with a
caveat that the company Google or or

916
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
caveat that the company Google or or
 

917
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,390
caveat that the company Google or or
call alphabet makes money from so many

918
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:19,400
call alphabet makes money from so many
 

919
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,350
call alphabet makes money from so many
other things and so just because the ad

920
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:23,360
other things and so just because the ad
 

921
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,430
other things and so just because the ad
model is under risk doesn't mean the

922
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
model is under risk doesn't mean the
 

923
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,070
model is under risk doesn't mean the
company is under risk um like for

924
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,080
company is under risk um like for
 

925
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,630
company is under risk um like for
example Sund announced that Google cloud

926
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
example Sund announced that Google cloud
 

927
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,909
example Sund announced that Google cloud
and YouTube together are on a hundred

928
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
and YouTube together are on a hundred
 

929
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,789
and YouTube together are on a hundred
billion annual recurring rate right

930
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
billion annual recurring rate right
 

931
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,310
billion annual recurring rate right
now so that alone should qualify Google

932
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:42,320
now so that alone should qualify Google
 

933
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,630
now so that alone should qualify Google
as a trillion dollar company if you use

934
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:43,640
as a trillion dollar company if you use
 

935
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,270
as a trillion dollar company if you use
a 10x multiplier and all that so the

936
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:46,280
a 10x multiplier and all that so the
 

937
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,149
a 10x multiplier and all that so the
company is not under any risk even if

938
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:48,159
company is not under any risk even if
 

939
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:52,070
company is not under any risk even if
the search advertising Revenue stops

940
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:52,080
the search advertising Revenue stops
 

941
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,950
the search advertising Revenue stops
delivering now so let me explain the

942
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:53,960
delivering now so let me explain the
 

943
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,430
delivering now so let me explain the
search advertising Revenue fornex so the

944
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:56,440
search advertising Revenue fornex so the
 

945
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,950
search advertising Revenue fornex so the
way Google makes money is it has pass

946
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
way Google makes money is it has pass
 

947
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,950
way Google makes money is it has pass

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,470
somewhere else but the actual
transaction happens through them because

1054
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,480
transaction happens through them because
 

1055
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,230
transaction happens through them because
of the click and therefore they get to

1056
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
of the click and therefore they get to
 

1057
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,909
of the click and therefore they get to
claim that you know you you bought the

through their referral and then so you
end up having to pay for it but I'm sure

into there's a reason for that uh let's
 

1091
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,470
into there's a reason for that uh let's
say you're you're typing shoes and you

1092
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:56,480
say you're you're typing shoes and you

1097
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,630
brands that are showing up as sponsored
but it's also because the good brands

1098
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:03,640
but it's also because the good brands
 

1099
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,029
but it's also because the good brands
are the ones who have a lot of money and

1100
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:06,039
are the ones who have a lot of money and
 

1101
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,070
are the ones who have a lot of money and
they pay the most for the corresponding

1102
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,080
they pay the most for the corresponding
 

1103
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,310
they pay the most for the corresponding
adward and it's more a competition

1104
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
adward and it's more a competition
 

1105
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,149

what do you learn from that and how is
 

1245
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,830
what do you learn from that and how is
perplexity different from that and not

perplexity different from that and not
 

1247
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,269
perplexity different from that and not
different from that yeah so perplexity

1248
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:01,279
different from that yeah so perplexity
 

1249
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,230

1260
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:16,840
great idea maybe the ad unit on a link
 

1261
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,750

um when the products started getting
 

1757
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,430
um when the products started getting
users uh I think instead of focusing on

as
possible and there was this Arbitrage

1774
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:36,280
possible and there was this Arbitrage
 

1775
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,190

that internet bust was happening at the
 

1777
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,310
that internet bust was happening at the
time and so a lot of phds who went and

1778
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,320
time and so a lot of phds who went and
 

1779
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,150
time and so a lot of phds who went and
work at other internet companies were

you take it for granted today but I
 

1797
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,589
you take it for granted today but I
don't think that was obvious I even read

that um at the time of launch of chrome
 

1801
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,550
that um at the time of launch of chrome
uh Larry would test Chrome intentionally

1802
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:11,560
uh Larry would test Chrome intentionally
 

1803
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,750
uh Larry would test Chrome intentionally
on very old versions of Windows on very

latency is bad obviously you know the
 

1811
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,230

engineers could say yeah you're testing

1812
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,240
engineers could say yeah you're testing
 

1813
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,589
engineers could say yeah you're testing
on some crappy laptop that's why it's

1814
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:23,599
on some crappy laptop that's why it's
 

1815
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,190
on some crappy laptop that's why it's
happening but Larry would say hey look

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:26,200
happening but Larry would say hey look

it has to work on a crappy laptop top so

1818
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:28,319
it has to work on a crappy laptop top so
 

1819
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,510
it has to work on a crappy laptop top so
that on a good laptop it would work even

1820
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:30,520
that on a good laptop it would work even
 

1821
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,990
that on a good laptop it would work even
with the worst internet so that's sort

1822
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,000
with the worst internet so that's sort
 

1823
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,150
with the worst internet so that's sort
of an Insight I I I apply it like

00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,160
of an Insight I I I apply it like
 

1825
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,550
of an Insight I I I apply it like
whenever I'm on a flight I always test

1826
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:38,560
whenever I'm on a flight I always test

whenever I'm on a flight I always test
perplexity on the flight Wi-Fi MH

1828
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:41,079
perplexity on the flight Wi-Fi MH
 

1829
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,950
perplexity on the flight Wi-Fi MH
because flight Wi-Fi usually

1830
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960
because flight Wi-Fi usually
 

1831
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,470
because flight Wi-Fi usually
sucks and I want to make sure the app is

1832
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:46,480
sucks and I want to make sure the app is
 

1833
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,510
sucks and I want to make sure the app is
fast even on that and I Benchmark it

1834
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:48,520
fast even on that and I Benchmark it
 

1835
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,829
fast even on that and I Benchmark it
against chubbt or uh gemini or any of

1836
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:51,839
against chubbt or uh gemini or any of
 

1837
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,829
against chubbt or uh gemini or any of
the other apps and try to make sure that

1838
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:53,839
the other apps and try to make sure that
 

1839
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,270
the other apps and try to make sure that
like the latency is pretty good it's

1840
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:56,280
like the latency is pretty good it's
 

1841
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,270
like the latency is pretty good it's
funny uh I do think it's a gigantic part

1842
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
funny uh I do think it's a gigantic part
 

1843

lot of the great product like Spotify

1848
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:06,119
lot of the great product like Spotify
 

1849
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:08,190
lot of the great product like Spotify
that's the story of Spotify in the early

1850
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,200
that's the story of Spotify in the early
 

1851
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,870
that's the story of Spotify in the early
days figure out how to

1852
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:09,880
days figure out how to
 

1853
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,109
days figure out how to
stream music with very low latency

1854
00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:13,119
stream music with very low latency
 

1855
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,510
stream music with very low latency
exactly that's uh it's an engineering

1856
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:15,520
exactly that's uh it's an engineering
 

1857
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,950
exactly that's uh it's an engineering
challenge but when it it's done right

1858
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:17,960
challenge but when it it's done right
 

1859
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,710
challenge but when it it's done right
like obsessively reducing latency you

1860
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,720
like obsessively reducing latency you
 

1861
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,710
like obsessively reducing latency you
actually have there's like a face shift

1862
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
actually have there's like a face shift
 

1863
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,870
actually have there's like a face shift
in the user experience where you're like

holy shit this becomes addicting and the
 

1867
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,270
holy shit this becomes addicting and the
amount of time you're frustrated goes

1868
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
amount of time you're frustrated goes
 

1869
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,829
amount of time you're frustrated goes
quickly to zero and every detail matters

1870

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,750
to start typing a query or you could
already have the cursor ready and so

already have the cursor ready and so
 

1879
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,870
already have the cursor ready and so
that they can just start typing every

perplexity and she just comes and tells
 

1923

perplexity and she just comes and tells
me the answer is not relevant I look at

1924
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079
me the answer is not relevant I look at
 

1925
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,030
me the answer is not relevant I look at
her query and I'm like first instinct is

1926
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:38,040
her query and I'm like first instinct is
 

1927
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,030
her query and I'm like first instinct is
like come on you didn't you didn't type

then I realized okay like is it her

1932
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:44,680
then I realized okay like is it her
 

1933
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,550
then I realized okay like is it her
fault like the product should understand

1934
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:46,560
fault like the product should understand
 

1935

um this is a story that Larry says where
 

1939
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,829
um this is a story that Larry says where
like you know they were they just tried

1940
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:54,839
like you know they were they just tried
 

1941
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,589
like you know they were they just tried
to sell Google to excite

1942
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
to sell Google to excite
 

1943
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,470
to sell Google to excite
and they did a demo to the exite CEO

1944
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:00,480
and they did a demo to the exite CEO
 

1945
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,750
and they did a demo to the exite CEO
where they would fire exite and Google

1946
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:02,760
where they would fire exite and Google
 

1947
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,230
where they would fire exite and Google
together and same type in the same query

1948
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:05,240
together and same type in the same query
 

1949
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,150
together and same type in the same query
like University and then in Google you

1950
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,160
like University and then in Google you
 

1951
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,630
like University and then in Google you
would rank Stanford Michigan and stuff

1952
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:09,640
would rank Stanford Michigan and stuff
 

1953
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,990
would rank Stanford Michigan and stuff
exite would just have like random

1954
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,000
exite would just have like random
 

1955
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,069
exite would just have like random
arbitrary

1956
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:12,079
arbitrary
 

1957
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,430
arbitrary
universities and the exite co would look

1958
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:15,440
universities and the exite co would look
 

1959
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,589
universities and the exite co would look
at it and it's like that's because you

1960
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:16,599
at it and it's like that's because you
 

1961
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,190
at it and it's like that's because you
didn't you know if you typed in this

1962
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,200
didn't you know if you typed in this
 

1963
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,750
didn't you know if you typed in this
query it would have worked on exite to

1964
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:20,760
query it would have worked on exite to
 

1965
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,510
query it would have worked on exite to
but that's like a simple philosophy

1966
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:22,520
but that's like a simple philosophy
 

1967
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,069
but that's like a simple philosophy
thing like you you just flip that you

1968
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:24,079
thing like you you just flip that you
 

1969
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,589
thing like you you just flip that you
say whatever the user types you're

1970
00:39:25,589 --> 00:39:25,599
say whatever the user types you're
 

1971
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,790
say whatever the user types you're
always supposed to give high quality

1972
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:26,800
always supposed to give high quality
 

1973
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,349
always supposed to give high quality
answers

1974
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:28,359
answers
 

1975
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:29,990
answers
then you build the product for that you

1976
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,000
then you build the product for that you
 

1977
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,069
then you build the product for that you
you go you you do all the magic behind

1978
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:32,079
you go you you do all the magic behind
 

1979
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,230
you go you you do all the magic behind
the scenes so that even if the user was

1980
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
the scenes so that even if the user was
 

1981
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,510
the scenes so that even if the user was
lazy even if there were typos even if

1982
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:36,520
lazy even if there were typos even if
 

1983
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,109
lazy even if there were typos even if
the speech transcription was wrong they

1984
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
the speech transcription was wrong they
 

1985
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,589
the speech transcription was wrong they
still got the answer and they allow the

1986
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:40,599
still got the answer and they allow the
 

1987
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:43,670
still got the answer and they allow the
product and that change forces you to do

1988
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
product and that change forces you to do
 

1989
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,670
product and that change forces you to do
a lot of things that are corly focused

1990
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
a lot of things that are corly focused
 

1991
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,309
a lot of things that are corly focused
on the user and also this is where I

1992
00:39:47,309 --> 00:39:47,319
on the user and also this is where I
 

1993
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,589
on the user and also this is where I
believe the whole prompt engineering

1994
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:49,599
believe the whole prompt engineering
 

1995
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,109
believe the whole prompt engineering
like trying to be a good prompt engineer

1996
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:52,119
like trying to be a good prompt engineer
 

1997
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,430
like trying to be a good prompt engineer
is not going to like be a long-term

1998
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:54,440
is not going to like be a long-term
 

1999
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,829
is not going to like be a long-term

where user doesn't even ask for

2004
00:39:59,550 --> 00:39:59,560
where user doesn't even ask for
 

2005

them even asking for it yeah one of the
 

2011
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,750
them even asking for it yeah one of the
things that perplex is clearly really

things that perplex is clearly really
 

2013
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,349
things that perplex is clearly really
good at is figuring out what I meant

2014
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
good at is figuring out what I meant
 

2015
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,910
good at is figuring out what I meant
from a poorly constructed query yeah and

2016
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:14,920
from a poorly constructed query yeah and
 

2017
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,390
from a poorly constructed query yeah and
I don't even need you to type in a query

2018
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
I don't even need you to type in a query
 

2019
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,990
I don't even need you to type in a query
you can just type in a bunch of words it

2020
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,000
you can just type in a bunch of words it
 

2021
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,910
you can just type in a bunch of words it
should be okay like that's the extent to

2022
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:21,920
should be okay like that's the extent to
 

2023
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,309
should be okay like that's the extent to
which you got to design the product cuz

2024
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319
which you got to design the product cuz
 

2025
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,309
which you got to design the product cuz
people are lazy and a better product

2026
00:40:27,309 --> 00:40:27,319
people are lazy and a better product
 

2027
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:29,550
people are lazy and a better product
should be one that allows you to be more

2028
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:29,560
should be one that allows you to be more
 

2029
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,710
should be one that allows you to be more
lazy not not not

2030
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:31,720
lazy not not not
 

2031
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,349
lazy not not not
less sure there is some like like the

2032
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:35,359
less sure there is some like like the
 

2033
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:37,630
less sure there is some like like the
other side of the argument is to say you

2034
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:37,640
other side of the argument is to say you
 

2035
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,109
other side of the argument is to say you
know if if you ask people to type in

2036
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:40,119
know if if you ask people to type in
 

2037
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,750
know if if you ask people to type in
clearer sentences it forces them to

2038
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:42,760
clearer sentences it forces them to
 

2039
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,190
clearer sentences it forces them to
think and and and that's a good thing

2040
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,200
think and and and that's a good thing
 

2041
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,750
think and and and that's a good thing
too but at the end like uh products need

2042
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:49,760
too but at the end like uh products need
 

2043
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,230
too but at the end like uh products need
to be having some magic to them and the

2044
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,240
to be having some magic to them and the
 

2045
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,670
to be having some magic to them and the
magic comes from letting you be more

2046
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:53,680
magic comes from letting you be more
 

2047
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,109
magic comes from letting you be more
lazy yeah right it's a it's a tradeoff

2048
00:40:56,109 --> 00:40:56,119
lazy yeah right it's a it's a tradeoff
 

2049
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,670
lazy yeah right it's a it's a tradeoff
but

2050
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
but
 

2051
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,510
but
one of the things you could ask people

2052
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
one of the things you could ask people
 

2053
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,349
one of the things you could ask people

set of features you don't know what to
 

2209
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,910
set of features you don't know what to
do right it's almost seems too simple

2210
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
do right it's almost seems too simple
 

2211
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,510
do right it's almost seems too simple
like is it just as simple as this so

2212
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:12,520
like is it just as simple as this so
 

2213
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,990
like is it just as simple as this so
there's a comfort initially to the

2214
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:16,000
there's a comfort initially to the
 

2215
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,710
there's a comfort initially to the
sidebar for example correct uh but again

00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:18,720
sidebar for example correct uh but again
 

2217

sidebar for example correct uh but again
you know kathi I'm probably me aspiring

2218
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:21,720
you know kathi I'm probably me aspiring
 

2219
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,230
you know kathi I'm probably me aspiring
to be a power user of things so I do

2220
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:25,240
to be a power user of things so I do
 

2221
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,589
to be a power user of things so I do
want to remove the side panel and

2222
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:26,599
want to remove the side panel and
 

2223
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,190
want to remove the side panel and
everything else and just keep it simple

2224
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,200
everything else and just keep it simple
 

2225
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,710
everything else and just keep it simple
yeah that's that's the hard part like

2226
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
yeah that's that's the hard part like
 

2227
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,910
yeah that's that's the hard part like
when you when you're growing when you're

2228
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
when you when you're growing when you're
 

2229
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,230
when you when you're growing when you're
trying to grow the user base but also

2230
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,240
trying to grow the user base but also
 

2231
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,150
trying to grow the user base but also
retain your exting users making sure

2232
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:37,160
retain your exting users making sure
 

2233
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,710
retain your exting users making sure
you're not H how do you balance the

2234
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:39,720
you're not H how do you balance the
 

2235
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,470
you're not H how do you balance the
tradeoffs um there's an interesting case

2236
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,480
tradeoffs um there's an interesting case
 

2237
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,430
tradeoffs um there's an interesting case
study of this nodes app and uh they just

2238
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:45,440
study of this nodes app and uh they just
 

2239
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,510
study of this nodes app and uh they just
kept on building features for their

2240
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:48,520
kept on building features for their
 

2241
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,870
kept on building features for their
power users and then what ended up

2242
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880
power users and then what ended up
 

2243
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,670
power users and then what ended up
happening is the new users just couldn't

2244
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:52,680
happening is the new users just couldn't
 

2245
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,470
happening is the new users just couldn't
understand the product at all and

2246
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:54,480
understand the product at all and
 

2247
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,549
understand the product at all and
there's a whole talk by a Facebook early

2248
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:56,559
there's a whole talk by a Facebook early
 

2249
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,470
there's a whole talk by a Facebook early
Facebook data science person uh who who

2250
00:44:59,470 --> 00:44:59,480
Facebook data science person uh who who
 

2251
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,190
Facebook data science person uh who who
was in charge of their growth that said

2252
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,200
was in charge of their growth that said
 

2253
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,549
was in charge of their growth that said
The more features they shipped for the

2254
00:45:03,549 --> 00:45:03,559
The more features they shipped for the
 

2255
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:05,549
The more features they shipped for the
new user than the existing user they

2256
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:05,559
new user than the existing user they
 

2257
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,790
new user than the existing user they
felt like that was more critical to

2258
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:07,800
felt like that was more critical to
 

2259
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,390
felt like that was more critical to
their growth and there are like so you

2260
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:11,400
their growth and there are like so you
 

2261
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,230
their growth and there are like so you
can just debate all day about this and

2262
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
can just debate all day about this and
 

2263
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,829
can just debate all day about this and
and this is why like product design like

2264
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
and this is why like product design like
 

2265
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,790
and this is why like product design like
growth is not easy yeah one of the

2266
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:18,800
growth is not easy yeah one of the
 

2267
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,589
growth is not easy yeah one of the
biggest challenges for

2268
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:20,599
biggest challenges for
 

2269
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:23,309
biggest challenges for
me is the the simple fact that people

2270
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:23,319
me is the the simple fact that people
 

2271
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:25,750
me is the the simple fact that people
that are frustrated the people who are

2272
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:25,760
that are frustrated the people who are
 

2273
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,670
that are frustrated the people who are
confused you you don't get that signal

2274
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:28,680
confused you you don't get that signal
 

2275
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:30,630
confused you you don't get that signal
or you the signal is very weak because

2276
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:30,640
or you the signal is very weak because
 

2277
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,670
or you the signal is very weak because
they'll try and they'll leave right and

2278
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:32,680
they'll try and they'll leave right and
 

2279
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,390
they'll try and they'll leave right and
you don't know what happened it's like

2280
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:34,400
you don't know what happened it's like
 

2281
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,109
you don't know what happened it's like
the silent frustrated majority right

2282
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:38,119
the silent frustrated majority right
 

2283
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:41,349
the silent frustrated majority right
every product figured out like one magic

2284
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359
every product figured out like one magic
 

2285
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,630

would come
 

2329
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,750
would come

they just do things that don't scale in
 

2337
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,670
they just do things that don't scale in
the polygram way but then um things

00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,670
the polygram way but then um things
start breaking more and more as you

one thing I've done is like take parts

2350
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:03,760
one thing I've done is like take parts
 

2351
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,589
one thing I've done is like take parts
from every person and so almost be like

2352
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:07,599
from every person and so almost be like
 

2353
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,230
from every person and so almost be like
an ensemble algorithm over them um so i'

2354
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:11,240
an ensemble algorithm over them um so i'
 

2355
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,710
an ensemble algorithm over them um so i'
probably keep the answer short and say

2356
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:12,720
probably keep the answer short and say
 

2357
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,670
probably keep the answer short and say
like each person what I took um like

2358
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:16,680
like each person what I took um like
 

2359
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,829
like each person what I took um like
with Bezos I think it's

2360

then uh in Tesa he didn't do that like

2558
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:20,200
then uh in Tesa he didn't do that like
 

2559
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,349
then uh in Tesa he didn't do that like
he actually didn't go with dealers and

2560
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
he actually didn't go with dealers and
 

2561
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,030
he actually didn't go with dealers and
he had dealt the relationship with the

2562
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,040
he had dealt the relationship with the
 

2563
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,309
he had dealt the relationship with the
users directly it's hard

2564
00:51:27,309 --> 00:51:27,319
users directly it's hard
 

2565
00:51:27,319 --> 00:51:29,030
users directly it's hard
uh you know you might never get the

2566
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,040
uh you know you might never get the
 

2567
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,430
uh you know you might never get the
critical mass but amazingly he managed

2568
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:32,440
critical mass but amazingly he managed
 

2569
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,829
critical mass but amazingly he managed
to make it happen so I think that sheer

2570
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:34,839
to make it happen so I think that sheer
 

2571
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,990
to make it happen so I think that sheer
force of will and like real first

2572
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:37,000
force of will and like real first
 

2573
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,190
force of will and like real first

See to the first principles of the

2606
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,200
See to the first principles of the
 

2607
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,910
See to the first principles of the
matter is like why are we doing it this

2608
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:17,920
matter is like why are we doing it this
 

2609
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,470
matter is like why are we doing it this
way it seems like a lot of bullshit like

2610
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:20,480
way it seems like a lot of bullshit like
 

2611
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,470
way it seems like a lot of bullshit like
anotation why are we doing annotation

2612
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:22,480
anotation why are we doing annotation
 

2613
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,030
anotation why are we doing annotation
this way maybe the user interface isn't

2614
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:24,040
this way maybe the user interface isn't
 

2615
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,589
this way maybe the user interface isn't
efficient or why are we doing annotation

2616
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:26,599
efficient or why are we doing annotation
 

2617
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:29,190
efficient or why are we doing annotation
at all yeah why why can't be

2618
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,200
at all yeah why why can't be
 

2619
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,390
at all yeah why why can't be
self-supervised and you can just keep

2620
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:31,400
self-supervised and you can just keep
 

2621
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,630
self-supervised and you can just keep
asking that why question yeah do have to

2622
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
asking that why question yeah do have to
 

2623
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,470
asking that why question yeah do have to
do it in the way we've always done can

2624
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:36,480
do it in the way we've always done can
 

2625
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,390
do it in the way we've always done can
we do it much simpler yeah and this

2626
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:38,400
we do it much simpler yeah and this
 

2627
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,190
we do it much simpler yeah and this
straight is also visible in like um

Jensen's pretty famous for like saying I

2640
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:56,319
Jensen's pretty famous for like saying I
 

2641
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:59,270
Jensen's pretty famous for like saying I
I just don't even do one-on ones cuz I

2642
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
I just don't even do one-on ones cuz I
 

2643
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,670
I just don't even do one-on ones cuz I
want to know simultaneously from all

2644
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:01,680
want to know simultaneously from all
 

2645
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,829
want to know simultaneously from all
parts of the system like all like I just

2646
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:03,839
parts of the system like all like I just
 

2647
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:06,630
parts of the system like all like I just
do one is to n and I have 60 direct

2648
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
do one is to n and I have 60 direct
 

2649
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,510
do one is to n and I have 60 direct
reports and I made all of them together

2650
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:08,520
reports and I made all of them together
 

2651
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,030
reports and I made all of them together
yeah and that gets me all the knowledge

2652
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:10,040
yeah and that gets me all the knowledge
 

2653
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,870
yeah and that gets me all the knowledge
at once and I can make the dots connect

2654
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:11,880
at once and I can make the dots connect
 

2655
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,670
at once and I can make the dots connect
and like it's lot more efficient like

2656
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
and like it's lot more efficient like
 

2657
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,109
and like it's lot more efficient like
questioning like the conventional wisdom

you know the b100s are going to be uh
 

2673
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:33,349
you know the b100s are going to be uh
30X more efficient on inference compared

2674
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
30X more efficient on inference compared
 

2675
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,109
30X more efficient on inference compared
to the h100s yeah like imagine that like

2676
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:36,119
to the h100s yeah like imagine that like
 

2677
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,470
to the h100s yeah like imagine that like
30X is not something that you would

2678
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
30X is not something that you would
 

2679
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,270
30X is not something that you would
easily get maybe it's not 30X in

2680
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:40,280
easily get maybe it's not 30X in
 

2681
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,670
easily get maybe it's not 30X in
performance it doesn't matter it's still

2682
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
performance it doesn't matter it's still
 

2683
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,230
performance it doesn't matter it's still
going to be pretty good and by the time

2684
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,240
going to be pretty good and by the time
 

2685
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,390
going to be pretty good and by the time
you match that that'll be like Reuben

2686
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,400
you match that that'll be like Reuben
 

2687
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,309
you match that that'll be like Reuben
mhm there always like Innovation

2688
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:48,319
mhm there always like Innovation
 

2689
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,190

happening the fascinating thing about

2690
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:50,200
happening the fascinating thing about
 

2691
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,829
happening the fascinating thing about
him like all the people that work with

2692
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
him like all the people that work with
 

2693
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:54,190
him like all the people that work with
him say that he doesn't just have that

2694
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:54,200
him say that he doesn't just have that
 

2695
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,630
him say that he doesn't just have that
like 2-year plan or whatever he he has

2696
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:56,640
like 2-year plan or whatever he he has
 

2697
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,870
like 2-year plan or whatever he he has
like a 10 20 30e plan oh really so he's

2698
00:53:59,870 --> 00:53:59,880
like a 10 20 30e plan oh really so he's
 

2699
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,990
like a 10 20 30e plan oh really so he's
like he's constantly thinking really far

2700
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:03,000
like he's constantly thinking really far
 

2701
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,789
like he's constantly thinking really far
ahead uh-huh

2702
00:54:04,789 --> 00:54:04,799
ahead uh-huh
 

2703
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,829
ahead uh-huh
so there's probably going to be that

2704
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:06,839
so there's probably going to be that
 

2705
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:09,069
so there's probably going to be that
picture of him that you posted every

2706
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:09,079
picture of him that you posted every
 

2707
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,030
picture of him that you posted every
year for the next 30 plus years once the

2708
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:12,040
year for the next 30 plus years once the
 

2709
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,990
year for the next 30 plus years once the
singularity happens and nji is here and

2710
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,000
singularity happens and nji is here and
 

2711
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,470
singularity happens and nji is here and
uh humanity is fundamentally transformed

2712
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:17,480
uh humanity is fundamentally transformed
 

2713
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,230
uh humanity is fundamentally transformed
he'll still be there in that leather

yeah they're so lowkey about dominating

2726
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:35,520
yeah they're so lowkey about dominating
 

2727
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,670
yeah they're so lowkey about dominating
I mean they're not lowkey but I met him

2728
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:37,680
I mean they're not lowkey but I met him
 

2729
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,150
I mean they're not lowkey but I met him
once and I asked him like uh how do you

2730
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:40,160
once and I asked him like uh how do you
 

2731
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,589
once and I asked him like uh how do you
how do you like handle the success and

how do you like handle the success and
 

2733
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:45,950
how do you like handle the success and
yet go and you know work hard and he

2734
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:45,960
yet go and you know work hard and he
 

2735
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,270
yet go and you know work hard and he
just said cuz I I'm actually paranoid

2736
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:48,280
just said cuz I I'm actually paranoid
 

2737
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,470
just said cuz I I'm actually paranoid
about going out of business like every

2738
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:50,480
about going out of business like every
 

2739
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,069
about going out of business like every
day I wake up like like in sweat

2740

thinking about like how things are going
 

2743
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,190
thinking about like how things are going
to go wrong because uh one thing you got

2744
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
to go wrong because uh one thing you got
 

2745
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,230
to go wrong because uh one thing you got
to understand Hardware is you got to

2746
00:54:59,230 --> 00:54:59,240
to understand Hardware is you got to
 

2747
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,190
to understand Hardware is you got to
actually I don't know about the 10 20

2748
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:01,200
actually I don't know about the 10 20
 

2749
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,710
actually I don't know about the 10 20
year thing but you actually do need to

2750
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
year thing but you actually do need to
 

2751
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,910
year thing but you actually do need to
plan two years in advance because it

2752
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:04,920
plan two years in advance because it
 

2753
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,670
plan two years in advance because it
does take time to fabricate and get the

2754
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:06,680
does take time to fabricate and get the
 

2755
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,829
does take time to fabricate and get the
chips back and like you need to have the

2756
00:55:08,829 --> 00:55:08,839
chips back and like you need to have the
 

2757
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,470
chips back and like you need to have the
architecture ready you might make

2758
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:10,480
architecture ready you might make
 

2759
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,109
architecture ready you might make
mistakes in one generation of

2760
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:12,119
mistakes in one generation of
 

2761
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,549
mistakes in one generation of
architecture and That Could set you back

2762
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:13,559
architecture and That Could set you back
 

2763
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:16,390
architecture and That Could set you back
by 2 years your competitor might like

2764
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,400
by 2 years your competitor might like
 

2765
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,910
by 2 years your competitor might like
get it right so there's like that sort

2766
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:18,920
get it right so there's like that sort
 

2767
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,309
get it right so there's like that sort
of Drive the paranoia Obsession about

2768
00:55:21,309 --> 00:55:21,319
of Drive the paranoia Obsession about
 

2769
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,670
of Drive the paranoia Obsession about
details you need that and he's a great

2770
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:23,680
details you need that and he's a great
 

2771
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,109
details you need that and he's a great
example yeah screw up one generation of

2772
00:55:26,109 --> 00:55:26,119
example yeah screw up one generation of
 

2773
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:29,349
example yeah screw up one generation of
G gpus and you're fucked yeah which is

2774
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:29,359
G gpus and you're fucked yeah which is
 

2775
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,390
G gpus and you're fucked yeah which is
that's terrifying to me just everything

2776
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:32,400
that's terrifying to me just everything
 

2777
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,870
that's terrifying to me just everything
about Hardware is terrifying to me cuz

2778
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:33,880
about Hardware is terrifying to me cuz
 

2779
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,309
about Hardware is terrifying to me cuz
you have to get everything right the all

2780
00:55:35,309 --> 00:55:35,319
you have to get everything right the all
 

2781
00:55:35,319 --> 00:55:37,270
you have to get everything right the all
the the mass production all the

2782
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
the the mass production all the
 

2783
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,710
the the mass production all the
different components the designs and

2784
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:39,720
different components the designs and
 

2785
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,270
different components the designs and
again there's no room for mistakes

2786
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
again there's no room for mistakes
 

2787
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,910
again there's no room for mistakes
there's no undo button yeah that's why

2788
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:42,920
there's no undo button yeah that's why
 

2789
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,829
there's no undo button yeah that's why
it's very hard for a startup to compete

2790
00:55:44,829 --> 00:55:44,839
it's very hard for a startup to compete
 

2791
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:48,270
it's very hard for a startup to compete
there because you have to not just be

2792
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:48,280
there because you have to not just be
 

2793
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,789
there because you have to not just be
great yourself but you also are betting

2794
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:50,799
great yourself but you also are betting
 

2795
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:53,589
great yourself but you also are betting
on the existing income and making a lot

2796
00:55:53,589 --> 00:55:53,599
on the existing income and making a lot
 

2797
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,589
on the existing income and making a lot
of

2798
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:54,599
of
 

2799
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,230
of
mistakes uh so who else you mentioned

2800
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:57,240
mistakes uh so who else you mentioned
 

2801
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,829
mistakes uh so who else you mentioned
Bezos you mentioned Elon yeah like Larry

I mean Zuckerberg's Obsession about like
 

2807
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,910
I mean Zuckerberg's Obsession about like
moving fast is like you know very famous

controversial for like whatever's

2826
00:56:28,349 --> 00:56:28,359
controversial for like whatever's
 

2827

happened in social media in general but
 

2829
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:33,990
happened in social media in general but
uh I think his positioning of meta and

2830
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
uh I think his positioning of meta and
 

2831
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,470
uh I think his positioning of meta and
like himself leading from the front in

2832
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:38,480
like himself leading from the front in
 

2833
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,510
like himself leading from the front in
AI uh open sourcing great models not

2834
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:41,520
AI uh open sourcing great models not
 

2835
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,950
AI uh open sourcing great models not
just random models really like llama

2836
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:43,960
just random models really like llama
 

2837
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,549
just random models really like llama
370b is a pretty good model I would say

2838
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
370b is a pretty good model I would say
 

2839
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,670
370b is a pretty good model I would say
it's pretty close to

2840
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:48,680
it's pretty close to
 

2841
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,470
it's pretty close to
gbd4 not worse in like longtail but 9010

2842
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:53,480
gbd4 not worse in like longtail but 9010
 

2843
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,270
gbd4 not worse in like longtail but 9010
is there and the 405b that's not

2844
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:56,280
is there and the 405b that's not
 

2845
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,349
is there and the 405b that's not
released yet will likely surpass it or

2846
00:56:58,349 --> 00:56:58,359
released yet will likely surpass it or
 

2847
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:00,510
released yet will likely surpass it or
be as good maybe less efficient doesn't

2848
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:00,520

from close to state of the art yeah and

2852
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:05,000
from close to state of the art yeah and
 

2853
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,190
from close to state of the art yeah and
it gives hope for a world where we can

2854
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
it gives hope for a world where we can
 

2855
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,190
it gives hope for a world where we can
have more

2856
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:08,200
have more
 

2857
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,150
have more
players instead of like two or three

2858
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:11,160
players instead of like two or three
 

2859
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,829

the the the most capable models and

2862
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:16,359
the the the most capable models and
 

2863
00:57:16,359 --> 00:57:17,470
the the the most capable models and
that's why I think it's very important

2864
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:17,480
that's why I think it's very important
 

2865

right and controversial at the time yeah
 

3025
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:41,630
right and controversial at the time yeah
and he he wasn't apologetic about it

3026
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:41,640
and he he wasn't apologetic about it
 

3027
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,390
and he he wasn't apologetic about it
yeah and and now he's saying something

3028
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:43,400
yeah and and now he's saying something
 

3029
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,190
yeah and and now he's saying something
else which is he's saying Auto

yeah which is also super controversial
 

3035
01:00:48,839 --> 01:00:50,549
yeah which is also super controversial
yeah and and and there is some element

3036
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
yeah and and and there is some element
 

3037
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,630
yeah and and and there is some element

saying it's going to go away but he's

3040
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:55,079
saying it's going to go away but he's
 

3041
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:57,270
saying it's going to go away but he's
just saying like that there is another

01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:57,280
just saying like that there is another

and then you can decode it into whatever

3056
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:15,480
and then you can decode it into whatever
 

3057
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,950
and then you can decode it into whatever

regressive or diffusion doesn't matter

3060
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:19,319
regressive or diffusion doesn't matter
 

3061
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:22,069
regressive or diffusion doesn't matter
and I think that could also be powerful

3062
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
and I think that could also be powerful
 

3063
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,390
and I think that could also be powerful
it might not be jepa it might be some

3064
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:23,400
it might not be jepa it might be some
 

3065
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,630
it might not be jepa it might be some
other methodology yeah I don't think

3066
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:24,640
other methodology yeah I don't think
 

3067
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,910
other methodology yeah I don't think
it's jepa yeah uh but I think what he's

3068
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:26,920
it's jepa yeah uh but I think what he's
 

3069
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,589
it's jepa yeah uh but I think what he's
saying is probably right like you could

3070
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:29,599
saying is probably right like you could
 

3071
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,430
saying is probably right like you could
be a lot more efficient if you uh do

3072
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:32,440
be a lot more efficient if you uh do
 

3073
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:35,029
be a lot more efficient if you uh do
reasoning in a much more abstract

3074
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:35,039
reasoning in a much more abstract
 

3075
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:36,910
reasoning in a much more abstract
representation and he's also pushing the

3076
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:36,920
representation and he's also pushing the
 

3077
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,910
representation and he's also pushing the
idea that the only uh maybe it's an

3078
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:39,920
idea that the only uh maybe it's an
 

3079
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,230
idea that the only uh maybe it's an
indirect implication but the way to keep

3080
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240

01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
controversial idea it's like really kind
 

3087
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,910
controversial idea it's like really kind
of yeah really saying open source is not

3088
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:49,920
of yeah really saying open source is not
 

3089
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,870
of yeah really saying open source is not
just good it's good on every front and

3090
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
just good it's good on every front and
 

3091
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,190
just good it's good on every front and
it's the only way forward I kind of

3092
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
it's the only way forward I kind of
 

3093
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,109
it's the only way forward I kind of
agree with that because if something is

3094
01:01:57,109 --> 01:01:57,119
agree with that because if something is
 

3095
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,069
agree with that because if something is
dangerous if you are actually claiming

3096
01:01:59,069 --> 01:01:59,079
dangerous if you are actually claiming
 

3097

01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:02,349
something is
dangerous wouldn't you want more

3100
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:02,359

eyeballs on it versus few I mean there's

3102
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,200
eyeballs on it versus few I mean there's
 

3103
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,470
eyeballs on it versus few I mean there's
a lot of arguments both directions

3104
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:07,480
a lot of arguments both directions
 

3105
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,670
a lot of arguments both directions
because people who are afraid of AGI

3106
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:10,680
because people who are afraid of AGI
 

3107
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,870
because people who are afraid of AGI
they're worried about it being a

3108
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:12,880
they're worried about it being a
 

3109
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,029
they're worried about it being a
fundamentally different kind of

01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:14,039
fundamentally different kind of
 

3111
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:16,829
fundamentally different kind of
Technology because of how rapidly can

3112
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:16,839
Technology because of how rapidly can
 

3113
01:02:16,839 --> 01:02:19,349
Technology because of how rapidly can
become good mhm and so the

3114
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:19,359
become good mhm and so the
 

3115
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,349
become good mhm and so the
eyeballs if you have a lot of eyeballs

3116
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:21,359
eyeballs if you have a lot of eyeballs
 

3117
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,029
eyeballs if you have a lot of eyeballs
on it some of those eyeballs will belong

3118
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:23,039
on it some of those eyeballs will belong
 

3119
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:25,349
on it some of those eyeballs will belong
to people who are malevolent and can

3120
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:25,359
to people who are malevolent and can
 

3121
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:28,630
to people who are malevolent and can
quickly do do harm or or try to harness

3122
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:28,640
quickly do do harm or or try to harness
 

3123
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,630

that power to uh to to abuse others like

01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
that power to uh to to abuse others like
 

3125
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,710
that power to uh to to abuse others like
on a mass scale so but you know history

3126
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:35,720

3128
01:02:38,510 --> 01:02:38,520
is Laden with people worrying about this
 

3129
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:39,990

new technology is fundamentally

3130
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:40,000
new technology is fundamentally
 

3131
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,510
new technology is fundamentally
different than every other technology

3132
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:41,520
different than every other technology
 

3133
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:46,069
different than every other technology
that ever came before it right so I tend

3134
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
that ever came before it right so I tend
 

3135
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:48,750
that ever came before it right so I tend
to trust the intuitions of Engineers who

3136
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:48,760
to trust the intuitions of Engineers who
 

3137
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,230
to trust the intuitions of Engineers who
are building who are closest to the

3138
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:50,240
are building who are closest to the
 

3139
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,990
are building who are closest to the
metal for building the systems right but

3140
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:53,000
metal for building the systems right but
 

3141
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,029
metal for building the systems right but
Al also those Engineers can often be

3142
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:55,039
Al also those Engineers can often be
 

3143
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,829
Al also those Engineers can often be
blind to to the big picture impact of

01:02:57,829 --> 01:02:57,839
blind to to the big picture impact of
 

3145
01:02:57,839 --> 01:02:59,870
blind to to the big picture impact of
right of a technology so you got to you

3146
01:02:59,870 --> 01:02:59,880
right of a technology so you got to you
 

3147
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,789
right of a technology so you got to you
got to listen to both yeah but open

3148
01:03:01,789 --> 01:03:01,799
got to listen to both yeah but open
 

3149
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:06,390

01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
uh while it has risks seems like the
 

3153
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,549
uh while it has risks seems like the
best way forward because it maximizes

3154
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:12,559
best way forward because it maximizes
 

3155
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,829
best way forward because it maximizes
transparency and gets the most mind like

01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:15,839
transparency and gets the most mind like
 

3157
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:17,910
transparency and gets the most mind like
you said I mean you can identify more

3158
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:17,920
you said I mean you can identify more
 

3159
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,990
you said I mean you can identify more
ways the systems can be misused faster

3160
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:21,000
ways the systems can be misused faster
 

3161
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,950
ways the systems can be misused faster
mhm and build the right God rails

3162
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
mhm and build the right God rails

idea maybe you can kind of try to

3218
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:28,480
idea maybe you can kind of try to
 

3219
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,789

01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:36,480
attention so uh I think I think first of
 

3225
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,789
attention so uh I think I think first of
all attention like like yosua Benjo

3226
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:38,799
all attention like like yosua Benjo
 

3227

that said you can just train a simple

3236
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:52,160
that said you can just train a simple

lot of Google compute like I think

3246
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:05,119
lot of Google compute like I think
 

3247
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:06,470
lot of Google compute like I think
probably like 400 million parameter

3248
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
probably like 400 million parameter
 

3249
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,029
probably like 400 million parameter
model or something even back in those

3250
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:08,039
model or something even back in those
 

3251
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:11,710
model or something even back in those
days and then this grad student

3252
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:11,720
days and then this grad student
 

3253
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,190
days and then this grad student
Bano uh in beno's lab identifies

Veil as compute mhm so clearly a great

3258
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:22,640
Veil as compute mhm so clearly a great
 

3259
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,750
Veil as compute mhm so clearly a great
idea and then people at De mine figured

3260
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:26,760
idea and then people at De mine figured
 

3261
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,309
idea and then people at De mine figured
that like like this paper called pixel

3262
01:05:29,309 --> 01:05:29,319
that like like this paper called pixel
 

3263
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:32,950
that like like this paper called pixel
rnn's um figured that uh you don't even

3264
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:32,960
rnn's um figured that uh you don't even
 

3265
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,710
rnn's um figured that uh you don't even
need RNN even though the title is called

3266
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:34,720
need RNN even though the title is called
 

3267
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,510
need RNN even though the title is called
pixel RNN uh I guess it's the actual

3268
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:37,520
pixel RNN uh I guess it's the actual
 

3269
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,470
pixel RNN uh I guess it's the actual
architecture that became popular was wet

3270
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
architecture that became popular was wet
 

3271
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,029
architecture that became popular was wet
and and they figured out that a

3272
01:05:42,029 --> 01:05:42,039
and and they figured out that a
 

3273
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,549
and and they figured out that a
completely convolutional model can do

3274
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:44,559
completely convolutional model can do
 

3275
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,549
completely convolutional model can do
autoregressive modeling as long as you

3276
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:46,559
autoregressive modeling as long as you
 

3277
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:48,710
autoregressive modeling as long as you
do mask convolutions the masking was the

3278
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:48,720
do mask convolutions the masking was the
 

3279
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:52,230
do mask convolutions the masking was the
key idea so you can train in parallel

3280
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:52,240
key idea so you can train in parallel
 

3281
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,750
key idea so you can train in parallel
instead of back propagating through time

3282
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:54,760
instead of back propagating through time
 

3283
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,750
instead of back propagating through time
you can back propagate through every

3284
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:56,760
you can back propagate through every
 

3285
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,349
you can back propagate through every
input token in parallel so that way you

3286
01:05:59,349 --> 01:05:59,359
input token in parallel so that way you
 

3287
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,510
input token in parallel so that way you
can utilize the GPU computer a lot more

3288
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:01,520
can utilize the GPU computer a lot more
 

3289
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,309
can utilize the GPU computer a lot more
efficiently cuz you're just doing mat

3290
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:04,319
efficiently cuz you're just doing mat
 

3291
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:07,710
efficiently cuz you're just doing mat
Ms uh and so they just said threw away

3292
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:07,720
Ms uh and so they just said threw away
 

3293
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,950
Ms uh and so they just said threw away
the RNN that was

3294
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:09,960
the RNN that was
 

3295
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:13,309
the RNN that was
powerful um and so then Google brain

3296
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:13,319
powerful um and so then Google brain
 

3297
01:06:13,319 --> 01:06:17,269
powerful um and so then Google brain
like wasani that the Transformer paper

3298
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:17,279
like wasani that the Transformer paper
 

3299
01:06:17,279 --> 01:06:19,309
like wasani that the Transformer paper
identified that okay let's let's take

3300
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:19,319
identified that okay let's let's take
 

3301
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:21,349
identified that okay let's let's take
the good elements of both let's take

3302
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:21,359
the good elements of both let's take
 

3303
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,390
the good elements of both let's take
attention it's more powerful than cons

3304
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,400
attention it's more powerful than cons
 

3305
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,910
attention it's more powerful than cons
it learns more more higher order

3306
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:26,920
it learns more more higher order
 

3307
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,950
it learns more more higher order
dependencies because it applies more

3308
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:28,960
dependencies because it applies more
 

3309
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,510
dependencies because it applies more
multiplicative compute and uh let's take

3310
01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:32,520
multiplicative compute and uh let's take
 

3311
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,829
multiplicative compute and uh let's take
the inside and wet that you can just

3312
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:35,839
the inside and wet that you can just
 

3313
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:38,349
the inside and wet that you can just
have a all convolution model that fully

3314
01:06:38,349 --> 01:06:38,359
have a all convolution model that fully
 

3315
01:06:38,359 --> 01:06:41,109
have a all convolution model that fully
parallel Matrix multiplies and combine

3316
01:06:41,109 --> 01:06:41,119
parallel Matrix multiplies and combine
 

3317
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:43,589
parallel Matrix multiplies and combine
the two together and they buil a

3318
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:43,599
the two together and they buil a
 

3319
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,990
the two together and they buil a
Transformer and that is

3320
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,000
Transformer and that is
 

3321
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,109
Transformer and that is
the I would say it's almost like the

3322
01:06:48,109 --> 01:06:48,119
the I would say it's almost like the
 

3323
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:50,910
the I would say it's almost like the
last answer that like nothing has

3324
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:50,920
last answer that like nothing has
 

3325
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,069
last answer that like nothing has
changed since 2017 except maybe a few

3326
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:54,079
changed since 2017 except maybe a few
 

3327
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,190
changed since 2017 except maybe a few
changes on what the nonlinearity are and

3328
01:06:56,190 --> 01:06:56,200
changes on what the nonlinearity are and
 

3329
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,150
changes on what the nonlinearity are and
like how the square root descaling

3330
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:58,160
like how the square root descaling
 

3331
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,390
like how the square root descaling
should be done like some of that has

3332
01:06:59,390 --> 01:06:59,400
should be done like some of that has
 

3333
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,870
should be done like some of that has
changed but and then people have tried

3334
01:07:01,870 --> 01:07:01,880
changed but and then people have tried
 

3335
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,150
changed but and then people have tried
mixture of experts having more

3336

mixture of experts having more
 

3337
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,349
mixture of experts having more
parameters per uh for the same flop and

3338
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:07,359
parameters per uh for the same flop and
 

3339
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,190

things like that but the core

3340
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:09,200
things like that but the core
 

3341
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,109
things like that but the core

isn't it crazy to you that masking as as

3344
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:14,200
isn't it crazy to you that masking as as
 

3345
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,510
isn't it crazy to you that masking as as
simple as something like that works so

3346
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:16,520
simple as something like that works so
 

3347
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,230
simple as something like that works so
damn well yeah it's a very clever

3348
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:19,240
damn well yeah it's a very clever
 

3349
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:22,109
damn well yeah it's a very clever
Insight that look you want to learn

3350
01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:22,119
Insight that look you want to learn
 

3351
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:24,549
Insight that look you want to learn
causal dependencies but you don't want

3352
01:07:24,549 --> 01:07:24,559
causal dependencies but you don't want
 

3353
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,510
causal dependencies but you don't want
to vase your Hardware your compute and

3354
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:28,520
to vase your Hardware your compute and
 

3355
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,430
to vase your Hardware your compute and
keep doing the back propagation

3356
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:30,440
keep doing the back propagation
 

3357
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:32,470
keep doing the back propagation
sequentially you want to do as much

3358
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,480
sequentially you want to do as much
 

3359
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,950
sequentially you want to do as much
parallel computer as possible during

3360
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:33,960

earlier running in eight days would run

3364
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:37,960
earlier running in eight days would run
 

3365
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,670
earlier running in eight days would run
like in a single day I think that was

3366
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:40,680
like in a single day I think that was
 

3367
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,510
like in a single day I think that was
the most important inside and like

3368
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:42,520
the most important inside and like
 

3369
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:44,190
the most important inside and like
whether it's cons or attention I guess

3370
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:44,200
whether it's cons or attention I guess
 

3371
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,670
whether it's cons or attention I guess
attention and and Transformers make even

3372
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:47,680
attention and and Transformers make even
 

3373
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,390
attention and and Transformers make even
better use of Hardware than cons uh

3374
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:51,400
better use of Hardware than cons uh
 

3375
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,630
better use of Hardware than cons uh
because they apply more uh compute per

3376
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:54,640
because they apply more uh compute per
 

3377
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,630
because they apply more uh compute per
flop because in a Transformer the self

3378
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:57,640
flop because in a Transformer the self
 

3379
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,670
flop because in a Transformer the self
attention operator doesn't even have

3380
01:07:59,670 --> 01:07:59,680
attention operator doesn't even have
 

3381
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:04,510
attention operator doesn't even have
parameters the qk transpose softmax

3382
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:04,520
parameters the qk transpose softmax
 

3383
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:07,390

times wi has no parameter but it's doing

3384
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:07,400
times wi has no parameter but it's doing
 

3385
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,349
times wi has no parameter but it's doing
a lot of flops and that's powerful it

3386
01:08:10,349 --> 01:08:10,359
a lot of flops and that's powerful it
 

3387
01:08:10,359 --> 01:08:14,349
a lot of flops and that's powerful it
learns Multi Auto dependencies I think

3388
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:14,359
learns Multi Auto dependencies I think
 

3389
01:08:14,359 --> 01:08:17,789
learns Multi Auto dependencies I think
the Insight then openi took from that is

3390
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:17,799
the Insight then openi took from that is
 

3391
01:08:17,799 --> 01:08:20,990
the Insight then openi took from that is
hey like Ilia s was been saying that

3392
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:21,000
hey like Ilia s was been saying that
 

3393
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,669
hey like Ilia s was been saying that
unsupervised learning is important right

3394
01:08:22,669 --> 01:08:22,679
unsupervised learning is important right
 

3395
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:23,749
unsupervised learning is important right
like they wrote this paper called

3396
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:23,759
like they wrote this paper called
 

3397
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,030
like they wrote this paper called
sentiment uron and then Alec Ratford and

3398
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,040
sentiment uron and then Alec Ratford and
 

3399
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,189
sentiment uron and then Alec Ratford and
him worked on this paper called gpt1

3400
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:29,199
him worked on this paper called gpt1
 

3401
01:08:29,199 --> 01:08:30,789
him worked on this paper called gpt1
it's not it wasn't even called gpt1 it

3402
01:08:30,789 --> 01:08:30,799
it's not it wasn't even called gpt1 it
 

3403
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,110
it's not it wasn't even called gpt1 it
was just called GPT little did they know

3404
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,120
was just called GPT little did they know
 

3405
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,829
was just called GPT little did they know
that it would go on to be this big but

3406
01:08:35,829 --> 01:08:35,839
that it would go on to be this big but
 

3407
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,430
that it would go on to be this big but
just said hey like let's revisit the

3408
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:38,440
just said hey like let's revisit the
 

3409
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,590
just said hey like let's revisit the
idea that you can just train a giant

3410
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:40,600
idea that you can just train a giant
 

3411
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,229
idea that you can just train a giant
language model and it would learn common

3412
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:43,239
language model and it would learn common
 

3413
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:45,990
language model and it would learn common
natural language common sense that was

3414
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,000
natural language common sense that was
 

3415
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,749
natural language common sense that was
not scalable earlier because you were

3416
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:47,759
not scalable earlier because you were
 

3417
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:51,430
not scalable earlier because you were
scaling up rnns but now you got this new

3418
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:51,440
scaling up rnns but now you got this new
 

3419
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:54,189
scaling up rnns but now you got this new
Transformer model that's 100x more

3420
01:08:54,189 --> 01:08:54,199
Transformer model that's 100x more
 

3421
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:56,149
Transformer model that's 100x more
efficient at getting to the same

3422
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:56,159
efficient at getting to the same
 

3423
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:58,110
efficient at getting to the same
performance which means if you run the

3424
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:58,120
performance which means if you run the
 

3425
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,390
performance which means if you run the
same job you would get something that's

3426
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:00,400
same job you would get something that's
 

3427
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,709
same job you would get something that's
way better if you apply the same amount

3428
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:02,719
way better if you apply the same amount
 

3429
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:04,590
way better if you apply the same amount
of compute and so they just train

3430
01:09:04,590 --> 01:09:04,600
of compute and so they just train
 

3431
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,070
of compute and so they just train
transformer on like uh all the books

3432
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:07,080
transformer on like uh all the books
 

3433
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,349
transformer on like uh all the books
like story books children's story books

3434
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
like story books children's story books
 

3435
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:11,630
like story books children's story books
and that that got like really good and

3436
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:11,640
and that that got like really good and
 

3437
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,990
and that that got like really good and
then Google took that inside and did B

3438
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,000
then Google took that inside and did B
 

3439
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,309
then Google took that inside and did B
except they did bir directional but they

3440
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:16,319
except they did bir directional but they
 

3441
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,789
except they did bir directional but they
trained on Wikipedia and books and that

3442
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:18,799
trained on Wikipedia and books and that
 

3443
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:21,110
trained on Wikipedia and books and that
got a lot better and then open I

3444
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:21,120
got a lot better and then open I
 

3445
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,110
got a lot better and then open I
followed up and said okay great so it

3446
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:23,120
followed up and said okay great so it
 

3447
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,550
followed up and said okay great so it
looks like the secret sauce that we were

3448
01:09:24,550 --> 01:09:24,560
looks like the secret sauce that we were
 

3449
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,870
looks like the secret sauce that we were
missing was data

3450
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:25,880
missing was data
 

3451
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,829
missing was data
and throwing more parameters so we'll

3452
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
and throwing more parameters so we'll
 

3453
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,430
and throwing more parameters so we'll
get gpt2 which is like a million

3454
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:29,440
get gpt2 which is like a million
 

3455
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,990
get gpt2 which is like a million
parameter model and like trained on like

3456
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:32,000
parameter model and like trained on like
 

3457
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,910
parameter model and like trained on like
a lot of links from Reddit and then that

3458
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:34,920
a lot of links from Reddit and then that
 

3459
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,110
a lot of links from Reddit and then that
became amazing like you know produce all

3460
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:37,120
became amazing like you know produce all
 

3461
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,870
became amazing like you know produce all
these stories about a unicorn and things

3462
01:09:38,870 --> 01:09:38,880
these stories about a unicorn and things
 

3463
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:41,470
these stories about a unicorn and things
like that if you remember yeah yeah um

3464
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:41,480
like that if you remember yeah yeah um
 

3465
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,910
like that if you remember yeah yeah um
and then like the GPD 3 happened which

3466
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:43,920
and then like the GPD 3 happened which
 

3467
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,149
and then like the GPD 3 happened which
is like you just scale up even more data

3468
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:46,159
is like you just scale up even more data
 

3469
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:48,110
is like you just scale up even more data
you take common crawl and instead of 1

3470
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:48,120
you take common crawl and instead of 1
 

3471
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,269
you take common crawl and instead of 1
billion go all the way to 175 billion

3472
01:09:51,269 --> 01:09:51,279
billion go all the way to 175 billion
 

3473
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:52,870
billion go all the way to 175 billion
but that was done through analysis

3474
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
but that was done through analysis
 

3475
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,870
but that was done through analysis
called the scaling loss which is for a

3476
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:55,880
called the scaling loss which is for a
 

3477
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,510
called the scaling loss which is for a
bigger model you need to keep scaling

3478
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:57,520
bigger model you need to keep scaling
 

3479
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,030
bigger model you need to keep scaling
the amount of tokens and you train on

3480
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
the amount of tokens and you train on
 

3481
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,070
the amount of tokens and you train on
300 billion tokens now it feels small

3482
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:02,080
300 billion tokens now it feels small
 

3483
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,550
300 billion tokens now it feels small
these models are being trained on like

3484
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:03,560
these models are being trained on like
 

3485
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:05,870
these models are being trained on like
tens of trillions of tokens and like

3486
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:05,880
tens of trillions of tokens and like
 

3487
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,470
tens of trillions of tokens and like
trillions of parameters but like this is

3488
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:07,480
trillions of parameters but like this is
 

3489
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,430
trillions of parameters but like this is
literally the evolution it's not like

3490
01:10:09,430 --> 01:10:09,440
literally the evolution it's not like
 

3491
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,830
literally the evolution it's not like
then the focus went more into like part

3492
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:11,840
then the focus went more into like part
 

3493
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,390
then the focus went more into like part
pieces outside the architecture on like

3494
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:14,400
pieces outside the architecture on like
 

3495
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,430

01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:19,480
are the tokens how ddop they are uh and
 

3499
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,830
are the tokens how ddop they are uh and
then the shinilla Insight that it's not

3500
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
then the shinilla Insight that it's not
 

3501
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,189
then the shinilla Insight that it's not
just about making the model bigger but

3502
01:10:24,189 --> 01:10:24,199
just about making the model bigger but
 

3503
01:10:24,199 --> 01:10:25,830
just about making the model bigger but
you want to also make the dat data set

3504
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:25,840
you want to also make the dat data set
 

3505
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,790
you want to also make the dat data set
bigger you want to make sure the tokens

3506
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:27,800
bigger you want to make sure the tokens
 

3507
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,149
bigger you want to make sure the tokens
are also big enough in quantity and high

3508
01:10:31,149 --> 01:10:31,159
are also big enough in quantity and high
 

3509
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:34,030
are also big enough in quantity and high
quality and do the right evals on like

3510
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:34,040
quality and do the right evals on like
 

3511
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:36,350
quality and do the right evals on like
lot of reasoning benchmarks so I think

3512
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,360
lot of reasoning benchmarks so I think
 

3513
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,550
lot of reasoning benchmarks so I think
that that ended up being the

3514
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,560
that that ended up being the
 

3515
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,390
that that ended up being the
Breakthrough right like this it's not

01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:41,400
Breakthrough right like this it's not
 

3517
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,510
Breakthrough right like this it's not
like attention alone was important

3518
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:43,520
like attention alone was important

there's this terminology for this uh
 

3553
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,229
there's this terminology for this uh
it's not very used in papers but like

it's not very used in papers but like
 

3555
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:33,910
it's not very used in papers but like
people talk about it as pre-train

01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:32,920
are all like stuff you do in the post
 

3605
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,030
are all like stuff you do in the post
training face and that's what allows you

3606
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:35,040
training face and that's what allows you
 

3607
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,750
training face and that's what allows you
to like build products that users can

3608
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:36,760
to like build products that users can

01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,990
like a lot more breakthroughs will be
made on the Post train side yeah Post

training part of Post train but like
 

3625
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:56,830

3632
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840

3633
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,870

interesting thought experiment here that

3634
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:04,880
interesting thought experiment here that
 

3635
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,590
interesting thought experiment here that
um we've been spending a lot of Compu in

3636
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:07,600
um we've been spending a lot of Compu in
 

3637
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:08,590
um we've been spending a lot of Compu in

common sense but that's seems brute

3642
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:14,080

3645
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,669

3646
01:13:20,669 --> 01:13:20,679

3647
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:23,229

exam if you've written exams in like

3648
01:13:23,229 --> 01:13:23,239
exam if you've written exams in like
 

3649
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:26,070
exam if you've written exams in like
like in undergrad or grad school where

3650
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080
like in undergrad or grad school where
 

3651
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,070
like in undergrad or grad school where
people allowed you to like come with

3652
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,080
people allowed you to like come with
 

3653
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:32,229
people allowed you to like come with
your notes to the exam versus no notes

3654
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:32,239
your notes to the exam versus no notes
 

3655
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,870
your notes to the exam versus no notes
allowed I think not the same set of

3656
01:13:34,870 --> 01:13:34,880
allowed I think not the same set of
 

3657
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,830
allowed I think not the same set of
people end up scoring number one on

3658
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
people end up scoring number one on
 

3659
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,629

both you're saying like pre-train is no

3660
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:40,639
both you're saying like pre-train is no
 

3661
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:43,550
both you're saying like pre-train is no
notes allowed kind of it it memorizes

3662
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:43,560
notes allowed kind of it it memorizes
 

3663
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,990
notes allowed kind of it it memorizes
everything like right you can you can

3664
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:45,000
everything like right you can you can
 

3665
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,189
everything like right you can you can
ask a question why do you need to

3666
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:46,199
ask a question why do you need to
 

3667
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:49,110
ask a question why do you need to
memorize every single fact to be good to

3668
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:49,120
memorize every single fact to be good to
 

3669
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,990
memorize every single fact to be good to
be good at reasoning yeah but somehow

3670
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:51,000
be good at reasoning yeah but somehow
 

3671
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,030
be good at reasoning yeah but somehow
that seems like the more and more Compu

3672
01:13:53,030 --> 01:13:53,040
that seems like the more and more Compu
 

3673
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,550
that seems like the more and more Compu
and data you throw at these models they

3674
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
and data you throw at these models they
 

3675
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,629
and data you throw at these models they
get better at reasoning but is there a

3676
01:13:56,629 --> 01:13:56,639
get better at reasoning but is there a
 

3677
01:13:56,639 --> 01:14:00,790
get better at reasoning but is there a
way to decouple reasoning from facts and

3678
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:00,800
way to decouple reasoning from facts and
 

3679
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,110
way to decouple reasoning from facts and
there are some interesting research

3680
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:02,120
there are some interesting research
 

3681
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,070
there are some interesting research
directions here like like Microsoft has

3682
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
directions here like like Microsoft has
 

3683
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,350
directions here like like Microsoft has
been working on this five models uh

3684
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
been working on this five models uh
 

3685
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,310
been working on this five models uh
where they're training small language

3686
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:09,320
where they're training small language

01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:13,199
training it on tokens that are important
 

3691
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,550
training it on tokens that are important
for reasoning and they're distilling the

3692
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:15,560
for reasoning and they're distilling the
 

3693
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,350

far you can get if you just take the

3696
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:20,480
far you can get if you just take the
 

3697
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:24,390
far you can get if you just take the
tokens of gp4 on data sets that require

3698
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:24,400
tokens of gp4 on data sets that require
 

3699
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,910
tokens of gp4 on data sets that require
you to reason

3700
01:14:25,910 --> 01:14:25,920
you to reason
 

3701
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:28,270
you to reason
and you train the model only on that you

3702
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:28,280
and you train the model only on that you
 

3703
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:29,510
and you train the model only on that you
don't need to train on all of like

3704
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:29,520
don't need to train on all of like
 

3705
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,910
don't need to train on all of like
regular internet Pages just train it on

3706
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:31,920
regular internet Pages just train it on
 

3707
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,750
regular internet Pages just train it on
like like basic Common Sense stuff but

3708
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:35,760
like like basic Common Sense stuff but
 

3709
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:37,550
like like basic Common Sense stuff but
it's hard to know what tokens are needed

3710
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:37,560
it's hard to know what tokens are needed
 

3711
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:38,990
it's hard to know what tokens are needed
for that it's hard to know if there's an

3712
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:39,000
for that it's hard to know if there's an
 

3713
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,750
for that it's hard to know if there's an
exhaustive set for that but if we do

3714
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
exhaustive set for that but if we do
 

3715
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,750
exhaustive set for that but if we do
manage to somehow get to a right data

3716
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:43,760
manage to somehow get to a right data
 

3717
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,110
manage to somehow get to a right data
set mix that gives good reasoning skills

3718
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:46,120
set mix that gives good reasoning skills
 

3719
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,270
set mix that gives good reasoning skills
for a small model then that's like a

3720
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:48,280
for a small model then that's like a
 

3721
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,910
for a small model then that's like a
breakthrough that disrupts the whole uh

01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:50,920
breakthrough that disrupts the whole uh

why I believe open source is important

3762
01:15:39,510 --> 01:15:39,520
why I believe open source is important
 

3763
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,430
why I believe open source is important
because at least it gives you like a

3764
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:41,440
because at least it gives you like a
 

3765
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,510
because at least it gives you like a
good base model to start with uh and and

reasoning uh so can you explain

3778
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:58,600
reasoning uh so can you explain
 

3779
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,790
reasoning uh so can you explain
like uh Chain of Thought yeah and that

3780
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:01,800
like uh Chain of Thought yeah and that
 

3781
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,430

that so Chain of Thought is this very
 

3785
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,990

what if you could force the model to go

3790
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:13,960
what if you could force the model to go
 

3791
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,750
what if you could force the model to go
through a reasoning step where it comes

3792
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:16,760
through a reasoning step where it comes
 

3793
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,990
through a reasoning step where it comes
up with an explanation and then arrives

3794
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:19,000
up with an explanation and then arrives
 

3795
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,510
up with an explanation and then arrives
that an answer almost like the

3796

the final answer
and by forcing models to go through that

3802
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
and by forcing models to go through that
 

3803
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,470
and by forcing models to go through that
reasoning pathway uh you're ensuring

3804
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
reasoning pathway uh you're ensuring
 

3805
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,390
reasoning pathway uh you're ensuring
that they don't overfit on extraneous

3806
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
that they don't overfit on extraneous
 

3807

they've not seen before uh by at least
 

3811
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,030
they've not seen before uh by at least
going through the reasoning chain and

3812
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:40,040
going through the reasoning chain and
 

3813
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,910
going through the reasoning chain and
and like the high level fact is they

3814
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:41,920
and like the high level fact is they
 

3815
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,510
and like the high level fact is they
seem to perform way better at NLP tasks

3816
01:16:44,510 --> 01:16:44,520
seem to perform way better at NLP tasks
 

3817
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:45,750
seem to perform way better at NLP tasks
if you force them to do that kind of

3818
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
if you force them to do that kind of
 

3819
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,270
if you force them to do that kind of
Chain of Thought like let s step by step

3820
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:48,280
Chain of Thought like let s step by step
 

3821
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,870
Chain of Thought like let s step by step
or something like that it's weird isn't

3822
01:16:49,870 --> 01:16:49,880
or something like that it's weird isn't
 

3823
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,910

that weird um it's not that weird that

3824
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
that weird um it's not that weird that
 

3825
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,229
that weird um it's not that weird that
such tricks really help a small model

3826
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:56,239
such tricks really help a small model
 

3827
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,470
such tricks really help a small model
compared to a larger model which might

3828
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:58,480
compared to a larger model which might
 

3829
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,950
compared to a larger model which might
be even better instruction tuned and

3830
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:00,960
be even better instruction tuned and
 

3831
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:03,229
be even better instruction tuned and
more common sense so so these tricks

3832
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:03,239
more common sense so so these tricks
 

3833
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:05,950
more common sense so so these tricks
matter less for the let's say gbd4

01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:05,960
matter less for the let's say gbd4

01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,669
going to be good at MH and how do you
make it good at that uh by bootstrapping

3849
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:26,990
its own reasoning abilities mhm uh it's
not not that these models are

not not that these models are
 

3851
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,790
not not that these models are
unintelligent but it's almost that we

3852
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:29,800
unintelligent but it's almost that we

intelligence by talking to them in
 

3857
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,149
intelligence by talking to them in

natural language but there's a lot of
 

3859
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,110

3861
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:39,590

parameters which is like trillions of
 

3863
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,830
parameters which is like trillions of
them but the only way we get to like

3864
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
them but the only way we get to like
 

3865
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,830
them but the only way we get to like
extract it is through like exploring

extract it is through like exploring
 

3867
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:48,590
extract it is through like exploring
them in natural language and it's one

3868
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:48,600
them in natural language and it's one
 

3869
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,550
them in natural language and it's one
way to uh accelerate that is by feeding

correct so the idea for the star paper

3876
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:57,960
correct so the idea for the star paper
 

3877
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,390
correct so the idea for the star paper
is that you take a prompt uh you take an

3878
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:00,400
is that you take a prompt uh you take an
 

3879
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,790
is that you take a prompt uh you take an
output you have a data set like this you

3880
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:02,800
output you have a data set like this you
 

3881
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,669
output you have a data set like this you
come up with explanations for each of

3882
01:18:04,669 --> 01:18:04,679
come up with explanations for each of
 

3883
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:06,669
come up with explanations for each of
those outputs and you train the model on

3884
01:18:06,669 --> 01:18:06,679
those outputs and you train the model on
 

3885
01:18:06,679 --> 01:18:08,990
those outputs and you train the model on
that now there are some impr promps

3886
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:09,000
that now there are some impr promps
 

3887
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,550
that now there are some impr promps
where it's not going to get it right now

3888
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:11,560
where it's not going to get it right now
 

3889
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:13,990
where it's not going to get it right now
instead of just training on the right

3890
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,000
instead of just training on the right
 

3891
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,149
instead of just training on the right
answer you ask it to produce an

explanation uh if you were given the
 

3895
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,550
explanation uh if you were given the
right answer what is the explanation you

3896
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:20,560
right answer what is the explanation you
 

3897
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,590
right answer what is the explanation you
have provided you train on that and for

whatever you got to write you just train
 

3901
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,229
whatever you got to write you just train
on the whole string of prompt uh

hint of the right answer you're you're
you're trying to like reason what would

3912
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:38,360
you're trying to like reason what would
 

3913
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,750
you're trying to like reason what would
have gotten me that right answer and

3914
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:39,760
have gotten me that right answer and
 

3915
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,830
have gotten me that right answer and
then training on that and mathematically

3916
01:18:41,830 --> 01:18:41,840
then training on that and mathematically
 

3917
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,870
then training on that and mathematically
you can prove that it's like related to

3918
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:43,880
you can prove that it's like related to
 

3919
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,870
you can prove that it's like related to
the variation lower bound uh in the L

3920
01:18:46,870 --> 01:18:46,880
the variation lower bound uh in the L
 

3921
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,110
the variation lower bound uh in the L
with the latent and uh I think it's a

3922
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:50,120
with the latent and uh I think it's a
 

3923
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,669
with the latent and uh I think it's a
very interesting way to use natural

3924
01:18:51,669 --> 01:18:51,679
very interesting way to use natural
 

3925
01:18:51,679 --> 01:18:54,070
very interesting way to use natural
language explanations as a latent that

3926
01:18:54,070 --> 01:18:54,080
language explanations as a latent that
 

3927
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,629
language explanations as a latent that
way you can ref find the model itself to

3928
01:18:56,629 --> 01:18:56,639
way you can ref find the model itself to
 

3929
01:18:56,639 --> 01:18:58,950
way you can ref find the model itself to
be the Reasoner for itself and you can

3930
01:18:58,950 --> 01:18:58,960
be the Reasoner for itself and you can
 

3931
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,950
be the Reasoner for itself and you can
think of like constantly collecting a

3932
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:00,960
think of like constantly collecting a
 

3933
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,550
think of like constantly collecting a
new data set where you're going to be

3934
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:02,560
new data set where you're going to be
 

3935
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,310
new data set where you're going to be
bad at trying to arrive at explanations

3936
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:05,320
bad at trying to arrive at explanations
 

3937
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:07,669
bad at trying to arrive at explanations
that will help you be good at it train

3938
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
that will help you be good at it train
 

3939
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:10,790
that will help you be good at it train
on it and then seek more harder data

3940
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:10,800
on it and then seek more harder data
 

3941
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,590
on it and then seek more harder data
points train on it and if this can be

3942
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
points train on it and if this can be
 

3943
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,229
points train on it and if this can be
done in a way where you can track a

3944
01:19:15,229 --> 01:19:15,239
done in a way where you can track a
 

3945
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:17,750
done in a way where you can track a
metric you can like start with something

3946
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:17,760
metric you can like start with something
 

3947
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,950
metric you can like start with something
that's like say 30% on like some math

3948
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:19,960
that's like say 30% on like some math
 

3949
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,470
that's like say 30% on like some math
benchmark and get something like 75 80%

3950
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:22,480
benchmark and get something like 75 80%
 

3951
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,310
benchmark and get something like 75 80%
MH so I I think it's going to be pretty

3952
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,320
MH so I I think it's going to be pretty
 

3953
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,669
MH so I I think it's going to be pretty
important

3954
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:25,679
important
 

3955
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,070
important
and the way it transcends just being

and the way it transcends just being
 

3957
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,950
and the way it transcends just being
good at math or coding is if getting

3958
01:19:30,950 --> 01:19:30,960
good at math or coding is if getting
 

3959
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,149
good at math or coding is if getting
better at math or getting better at

build agents using those kind of models
 

3969
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:45,510
build agents using those kind of models
that that's when like I think it's going

3970
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:45,520
that that's when like I think it's going
 

3971
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,310
that that's when like I think it's going
to be getting pretty interesting it's

01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:47,320
to be getting pretty interesting it's

01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,030
to be getting pretty interesting it's
not clear yet nobody's empirically shown

this is the case that this can go to the

this is the case that this can go to the
 

3977
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,629
this is the case that this can go to the
space of Agents yeah but this is a good

3978
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:55,639
space of Agents yeah but this is a good
 

3979
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:57,870
space of Agents yeah but this is a good
bet to make that if you have a model

3980
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:57,880
bet to make that if you have a model
 

3981
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,629

01:19:59,629 --> 01:19:59,639
that's like pretty good at math and
 

3983
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:02,669
that's like pretty good at math and

you think it's possible we live in a

each other that's that's what this kind
 

4011
01:20:33,679 --> 01:20:35,310
each other that's that's what this kind
of at least to me seems like it's

4012
01:20:35,310 --> 01:20:35,320
of at least to me seems like it's
 

4013
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:37,070
of at least to me seems like it's
pushing towards that direction yeah and

01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:37,080
pushing towards that direction yeah and
 

4015
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:40,270
pushing towards that direction yeah and
it's not obvious to me that that's not

4016
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:40,280
it's not obvious to me that that's not
 

4017
01:20:40,280 --> 01:20:43,030
it's not obvious to me that that's not
possible it's not possible to say like

01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:43,040
possible it's not possible to say like
 

4019
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,950
possible it's not possible to say like
like unless mathematically you can say

4020
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:44,960
like unless mathematically you can say
 

4021
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:47,950
like unless mathematically you can say
it's not possible right uh it's hard to

4022
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:47,960
it's not possible right uh it's hard to
 

4023
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:49,950
it's not possible right uh it's hard to
say it's not possible of course there

4024
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:49,960
say it's not possible of course there
 

4025
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,189
say it's not possible of course there
are some simple arguments you can make

4026
01:20:52,189 --> 01:20:52,199
are some simple arguments you can make
 

4027
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:55,270
are some simple arguments you can make
like where is the new signal to this is

4028
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:55,280
like where is the new signal to this is
 

4029
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,030
like where is the new signal to this is
the AI coming from like how are you

4030
01:20:58,030 --> 01:20:58,040
the AI coming from like how are you
 

4031
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,709
the AI coming from like how are you
creating new signal from nothing there

4032
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:00,719
creating new signal from nothing there
 

4033
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:02,590
creating new signal from nothing there
has to be some human annotation like for

4034
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:02,600
has to be some human annotation like for
 

4035
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,950
has to be some human annotation like for

4039
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,550
go or chess you know who won the game
that was signal and that's according to

4040
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:08,560
that was signal and that's according to
 

4041
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:10,709
that was signal and that's according to
the rules of the game yeah in in these

01:21:10,709 --> 01:21:10,719
the rules of the game yeah in in these
 

4043
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:12,990
the rules of the game yeah in in these
AI tasks like of course for Math and

4044
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:13,000
AI tasks like of course for Math and
 

4045
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,310
AI tasks like of course for Math and
coding you can always verify if

4046
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:15,320
coding you can always verify if
 

4047
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,110
coding you can always verify if
something is correct through traditional

something is correct through traditional
 

4049
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,750
something is correct through traditional
verifiers but for more open-ended things

4050
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:20,760
verifiers but for more open-ended things
 

4051
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:24,750
verifiers but for more open-ended things
like say uh predict the stock market for

4052
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:24,760
like say uh predict the stock market for
 

4053
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,910
like say uh predict the stock market for
Q3 mhm like what what is correct you

4054
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:27,920
Q3 mhm like what what is correct you
 

4055
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,070
Q3 mhm like what what is correct you
don't even know MH okay maybe you can

4056
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:30,080
don't even know MH okay maybe you can
 

4057
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,270
don't even know MH okay maybe you can
use historic data I I only give you data

4058
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:32,280
use historic data I I only give you data
 

4059
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,910
use historic data I I only give you data
until q1 and see if you predicted well

4060
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:34,920
until q1 and see if you predicted well
 

4061
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,870
until q1 and see if you predicted well
for Q2 and you train on that signal

4062
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:36,880
for Q2 and you train on that signal
 

4063
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:39,390
for Q2 and you train on that signal
maybe that that's useful uh and you then

4064
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:39,400
maybe that that's useful uh and you then
 

4065
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,910
maybe that that's useful uh and you then
you still have to collect uh a bunch of

4066
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:41,920
you still have to collect uh a bunch of
 

4067
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:45,189
you still have to collect uh a bunch of
tasks like that and create a RL suit for

4068
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:45,199
tasks like that and create a RL suit for
 

4069
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,350
tasks like that and create a RL suit for
that or like give agents like tasks like

4070
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:47,360
that or like give agents like tasks like
 

4071
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,510
that or like give agents like tasks like
a browser and ask them to do things and

4072
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:49,520
a browser and ask them to do things and
 

4073
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,990
a browser and ask them to do things and
sandbox it and verif like completion is

4074
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,000
sandbox it and verif like completion is
 

4075
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,470
sandbox it and verif like completion is
based on whether the task was achieved

4076
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:53,480
based on whether the task was achieved
 

4077
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,950
based on whether the task was achieved
which will be verified by human so you

4078
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:54,960
which will be verified by human so you
 

4079
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,030
which will be verified by human so you
you do need to set up uh like a RL

4080
01:21:58,030 --> 01:21:58,040
you do need to set up uh like a RL
 

4081
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,910
you do need to set up uh like a RL
sandbox for these agents to like play

4082
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:00,920
sandbox for these agents to like play
 

4083
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:03,510
sandbox for these agents to like play
and test and verify and get signal from

4084
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:03,520
and test and verify and get signal from
 

4085
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,550
and test and verify and get signal from
humans at some point yeah but I guess

4086
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:05,560
humans at some point yeah but I guess
 

4087
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,390
humans at some point yeah but I guess
the the the idea is that the amount of

4088
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:08,400
the the the idea is that the amount of
 

4089
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,310
the the the idea is that the amount of
signal you need relative to how much new

4090
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:11,320
signal you need relative to how much new
 

4091
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,629
signal you need relative to how much new
intelligence you gain is much smaller so

4092
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:13,639
intelligence you gain is much smaller so
 

4093
01:22:13,639 --> 01:22:15,070
intelligence you gain is much smaller so
you just need to interact with humans

4094
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:15,080
you just need to interact with humans
 

4095
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,149
you just need to interact with humans

because there's a lot of humans using AI
 

4151
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,790
because there's a lot of humans using AI
systems like can you have a conversation

4152
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:25,800
systems like can you have a conversation
 

4153
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,629
systems like can you have a conversation
with an AI where it feels like you talk

4154
01:23:27,629 --> 01:23:27,639
with an AI where it feels like you talk

with an AI where it feels like you talk
to

4156
01:23:28,590 --> 01:23:28,600
to
 

4157
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,950
to
Einstein or Fineman where you ask them a

4158
01:23:31,950 --> 01:23:31,960
Einstein or Fineman where you ask them a
 

4159
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,030
Einstein or Fineman where you ask them a
hard question they're like I don't know

4160
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:34,040
hard question they're like I don't know
 

4161
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,070
hard question they're like I don't know
and then after a week they did a lot of

4162
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:36,080
and then after a week they did a lot of
 

4163
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,830
and then after a week they did a lot of
resar and come back yeah and come back

4164
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:37,840
resar and come back yeah and come back
 

4165
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,510
resar and come back yeah and come back
and just blow your mind I think that

4166
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:40,520
and just blow your mind I think that
 

4167
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,669
and just blow your mind I think that
that that's that if if we can achieve

4168
01:23:42,669 --> 01:23:42,679
that that's that if if we can achieve
 

4169
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:45,550
that that's that if if we can achieve
that that amount of inference compute

4170
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:45,560
that that amount of inference compute
 

4171
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,390
that that amount of inference compute
where it leads to a dramatically better

4172
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:47,400
where it leads to a dramatically better
 

4173
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,110
where it leads to a dramatically better
answer as you apply more inference

4174
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:49,120
answer as you apply more inference
 

4175
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,669
answer as you apply more inference
compute I think that would be the

4176
01:23:50,669 --> 01:23:50,679
compute I think that would be the
 

4177
01:23:50,679 --> 01:23:52,629

beginning of like real reasoning
 

4179
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:54,990
beginning of like real reasoning
breakthroughs so you think fundamentally

4180
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:55,000
breakthroughs so you think fundamentally
 

4181
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,590
breakthroughs so you think fundamentally
AI is capable of that kind of reasoning

4182
01:23:57,590 --> 01:23:57,600
AI is capable of that kind of reasoning
 

4183
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,470
AI is capable of that kind of reasoning
it's possible Right like we haven't

4184
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:00,480
it's possible Right like we haven't
 

4185
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,669
it's possible Right like we haven't
cracked but nothing says like we cannot

4186
01:24:03,669 --> 01:24:03,679
cracked but nothing says like we cannot
 

4187
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,990
cracked but nothing says like we cannot
ever crack it what makes humans special

4188
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:06,000
ever crack it what makes humans special
 

4189
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,910
ever crack it what makes humans special
though is like our curiosity mhm like

4190
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:08,920
though is like our curiosity mhm like
 

4191
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,669
though is like our curiosity mhm like
even if as cracked

4192
01:24:10,669 --> 01:24:10,679
even if as cracked
 

4193
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:13,510
even if as cracked
this it's it's us like still asking them

4194
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:13,520
this it's it's us like still asking them
 

4195
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:16,550
this it's it's us like still asking them
to go explore something and one thing

4196
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
to go explore something and one thing
 

4197
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,350
to go explore something and one thing
that I feel like as haven't cracked yet

4198
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:18,360
that I feel like as haven't cracked yet
 

4199
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,990
that I feel like as haven't cracked yet
is like being naturally curious and

4200
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:21,000
is like being naturally curious and
 

4201
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,870
is like being naturally curious and
coming up with interesting questions to

4202
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880
coming up with interesting questions to
 

4203
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:24,550
coming up with interesting questions to
understand the world and going and

4204
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:24,560
understand the world and going and
 

4205
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,390
understand the world and going and
digging deeper about them yeah that's

4206
01:24:26,390 --> 01:24:26,400
digging deeper about them yeah that's
 

4207
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,830
digging deeper about them yeah that's
one of the missions of the company is to

4208
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:27,840
one of the missions of the company is to
 

4209
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,830
one of the missions of the company is to
cater to human curiosity and it surfaces

4210
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:31,840
cater to human curiosity and it surfaces
 

4211
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,830
cater to human curiosity and it surfaces
this fundamental question is like where

4212
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:33,840
this fundamental question is like where
 

4213
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,990
this fundamental question is like where
does that Curiosity come from exactly

4214
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,000
does that Curiosity come from exactly
 

4215
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,110
does that Curiosity come from exactly
it's not well understood yeah and I I

4216
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:38,120
it's not well understood yeah and I I
 

4217
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,270
it's not well understood yeah and I I
also think it's what kind of makes us

4218
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:40,280
also think it's what kind of makes us
 

4219
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,910
also think it's what kind of makes us
really special I know you you talk a lot

4220
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:42,920
really special I know you you talk a lot
 

4221
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:44,790
really special I know you you talk a lot
about this you know what makes human

4222
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:44,800
about this you know what makes human
 

4223
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:45,870
about this you know what makes human
special is

4224
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:45,880
special is
 

4225
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,669
special is
love uh like natural beauty to the like

like how we live and things like that I
 

4229
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:54,109
like how we live and things like that I
I think another dimension is we just

4230
01:24:54,109 --> 01:24:54,119
I think another dimension is we just
 

4231
01:24:54,119 --> 01:24:59,030
I think another dimension is we just
like deeply curious as as a species and

4232
01:24:59,030 --> 01:24:59,040
like deeply curious as as a species and
 

4233
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,790
like deeply curious as as a species and
um I think we have like like some work

4234
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:01,800
um I think we have like like some work
 

4235
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,109
um I think we have like like some work
in AI have explored this like curiosity

4236
01:25:04,109 --> 01:25:04,119
in AI have explored this like curiosity
 

4237
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:07,590
in AI have explored this like curiosity
driven exploration you know like berley

4238
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
driven exploration you know like berley
 

4239
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,430
driven exploration you know like berley
Professor alosa fro has written some

4240
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:10,440
Professor alosa fro has written some
 

4241
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:12,990
Professor alosa fro has written some
papers on this where you know in RL what

4242
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:13,000
papers on this where you know in RL what
 

4243
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,189
papers on this where you know in RL what
happens if you just don't have any

4244
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:14,199
happens if you just don't have any
 

4245
01:25:14,199 --> 01:25:16,750
happens if you just don't have any
reward signal and and an agent just

4246
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:16,760
reward signal and and an agent just
 

4247
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,350
reward signal and and an agent just
explores based on prediction errors and

4248
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,360
explores based on prediction errors and
 

4249
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,950
explores based on prediction errors and
like like he showed that you can even

4250
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:20,960
like like he showed that you can even
 

4251
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,149
like like he showed that you can even
complete a whole Mario game or like a

4252
01:25:23,149 --> 01:25:23,159
complete a whole Mario game or like a
 

4253
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:25,470
complete a whole Mario game or like a
level but Lally just being

4254
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:25,480
level but Lally just being
 

4255
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:28,870
level but Lally just being
curious uh because it games are designed

4256
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:28,880
curious uh because it games are designed
 

4257
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:31,070
curious uh because it games are designed
that way by the designer to like keep

4258
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:31,080
that way by the designer to like keep
 

4259
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:33,870
that way by the designer to like keep
leading you to new things so I think but

4260
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:33,880
leading you to new things so I think but
 

4261
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,510
leading you to new things so I think but
but that's just like works at the game

4262
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
but that's just like works at the game
 

4263
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,310
but that's just like works at the game
level and like nothing has been done to

4264
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:37,320
level and like nothing has been done to
 

4265
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:40,629
level and like nothing has been done to
like really mimic real human curiosity

4266
01:25:40,629 --> 01:25:40,639
like really mimic real human curiosity
 

4267
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:43,229
like really mimic real human curiosity
so I feel like even in a world where you

4268
01:25:43,229 --> 01:25:43,239
so I feel like even in a world where you
 

4269
01:25:43,239 --> 01:25:45,870
so I feel like even in a world where you
know you call that an AGI if you can you

4270
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:45,880
know you call that an AGI if you can you
 

4271
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,550
know you call that an AGI if you can you
feel like you can have a conversation

4272
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:47,560
feel like you can have a conversation
 

4273
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,229
feel like you can have a conversation
with an AI scientists at the level of

4274
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:50,239
with an AI scientists at the level of
 

4275
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:52,990
with an AI scientists at the level of
findan even in such a world like I don't

4276
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:53,000
findan even in such a world like I don't
 

4277
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,830
findan even in such a world like I don't
think uh there's any indication to me

4278
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:55,840
think uh there's any indication to me
 

4279
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,109
think uh there's any indication to me
that we can mimic fineman's curiosity we

4280
01:25:58,109 --> 01:25:58,119
that we can mimic fineman's curiosity we
 

4281
01:25:58,119 --> 01:26:00,830
that we can mimic fineman's curiosity we
could mimic fineman's ability to like

4282
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:00,840
could mimic fineman's ability to like
 

4283
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,430
could mimic fineman's ability to like
thoroughly research something and come

4284
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:03,440
thoroughly research something and come
 

4285
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,270
thoroughly research something and come
up with non-trivial answers to something

4286
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:06,280
up with non-trivial answers to something
 

4287
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,870
up with non-trivial answers to something
but can we mimic his Natural Curiosity

4288
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:08,880
but can we mimic his Natural Curiosity
 

4289
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,270
but can we mimic his Natural Curiosity
and about just you know his his period

4290
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:12,280
and about just you know his his period
 

4291
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,709
and about just you know his his period
of like just being naturally curious

4292
01:26:13,709 --> 01:26:13,719
of like just being naturally curious
 

4293
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:16,149
of like just being naturally curious
about so many different things uh and

4294
01:26:16,149 --> 01:26:16,159
about so many different things uh and
 

4295
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:17,870
about so many different things uh and
like endeavoring to like try to

4296
01:26:17,870 --> 01:26:17,880
like endeavoring to like try to
 

4297
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,910
like endeavoring to like try to
understand the right question or seek

4298
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:20,920
understand the right question or seek
 

4299
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:22,270
understand the right question or seek
explanations for the right question it's

4300
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:22,280
explanations for the right question it's
 

4301
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:24,950
explanations for the right question it's
not clear to me yet it feels like the

4302
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:24,960
not clear to me yet it feels like the
 

4303
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,470
not clear to me yet it feels like the
process that perplexity is doing where

4304
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:26,480
process that perplexity is doing where
 

4305
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,910
process that perplexity is doing where
you ask a question you answer it and

4306
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:27,920
you ask a question you answer it and
 

4307
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,990
you ask a question you answer it and
then you go on to the next related

4308
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:30,000
then you go on to the next related
 

4309
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,629
then you go on to the next related
question and this chain of questions mhm

4310
01:26:32,629 --> 01:26:32,639
question and this chain of questions mhm
 

4311
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:34,310
question and this chain of questions mhm
that feels like that could be instilled

4312
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320
that feels like that could be instilled
 

4313
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,189
that feels like that could be instilled
into AI just

4314
01:26:36,189 --> 01:26:36,199
into AI just
 

4315
01:26:36,199 --> 01:26:38,950
into AI just
constantly searching you are the one who

4316
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:38,960
constantly searching you are the one who
 

4317
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,550
constantly searching you are the one who
made the decision on like the initial

4318
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:40,560
made the decision on like the initial
 

4319
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:42,390
made the decision on like the initial
spark for the fire yeah and you don't

4320
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,400
spark for the fire yeah and you don't
 

4321
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,990
spark for the fire yeah and you don't
even need to ask the

4322
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:46,000
even need to ask the
 

4323
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,229
even need to ask the
exact question we suggested it's more a

4324
01:26:49,229 --> 01:26:49,239
exact question we suggested it's more a
 

4325
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:51,950
exact question we suggested it's more a
guidance for you you could ask anything

4326
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:51,960
guidance for you you could ask anything
 

4327
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:55,229
guidance for you you could ask anything
else and if AI can go and explore the

4328
01:26:55,229 --> 01:26:55,239
else and if AI can go and explore the
 

4329
01:26:55,239 --> 01:26:57,629
else and if AI can go and explore the
world and ask their own questions come

4330
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:57,639
world and ask their own questions come
 

4331
01:26:57,639 --> 01:27:00,030
world and ask their own questions come
back and like come up with their own

4332
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:00,040
back and like come up with their own
 

4333
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,910
back and like come up with their own
great answers it almost feels like you

4334
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:01,920
great answers it almost feels like you
 

4335
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:06,390
great answers it almost feels like you
got a whole GPU server that's just like

4336
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:06,400
got a whole GPU server that's just like
 

4337
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,510
got a whole GPU server that's just like
hey you give the task you know just just

4338
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:08,520
hey you give the task you know just just
 

4339
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,189
hey you give the task you know just just
do go and

4340
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:10,199
do go and
 

4341
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:15,189
do go and
explore uh drug drug design like figure

4342
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:15,199
explore uh drug drug design like figure
 

4343
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:17,950
explore uh drug drug design like figure
out how to take Alpha full 3 and make a

4344
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:17,960
out how to take Alpha full 3 and make a
 

4345
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:20,510
out how to take Alpha full 3 and make a
drug that cures cancer and come back to

4346
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:20,520
drug that cures cancer and come back to
 

4347
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:22,550
drug that cures cancer and come back to
me once you find something amazing and

4348
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:22,560
me once you find something amazing and
 

4349
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,550
me once you find something amazing and
then it you pay like say $10 million for

4350
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:25,560
then it you pay like say $10 million for
 

4351
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,470
then it you pay like say $10 million for
that job M but then the answer came up

4352
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:28,480
that job M but then the answer came up
 

4353
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,430
that job M but then the answer came up
came back with you it's like completely

4354
01:27:30,430 --> 01:27:30,440
came back with you it's like completely
 

4355
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,470
came back with you it's like completely
new way to do things and what is the

4356
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:33,480
new way to do things and what is the
 

4357
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,709
new way to do things and what is the
value of that one particular

4358
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:35,719
value of that one particular
 

4359
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:38,590
value of that one particular
answer that would be insane if if it

4360
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:38,600
answer that would be insane if if it
 

4361
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:41,149
answer that would be insane if if it
worked so that's just our world that I

4362
01:27:41,149 --> 01:27:41,159
worked so that's just our world that I
 

4363
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:42,229
worked so that's just our world that I
think we don't need to really worry

4364
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:42,239
think we don't need to really worry
 

4365
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,510
think we don't need to really worry
about AI is going rogue and taking over

4366
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:45,520
about AI is going rogue and taking over
 

4367
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,470
about AI is going rogue and taking over
the world but it's less about access to

4368
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:48,480
the world but it's less about access to
 

4369
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,470
the world but it's less about access to
a model's weights it's more access to

4370
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:50,480
a model's weights it's more access to
 

4371
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:51,790
a model's weights it's more access to
compute that

4372
01:27:51,790 --> 01:27:51,800
compute that
 

4373
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,149
compute that
is uh you know putting the world in like

4374
01:27:55,149 --> 01:27:55,159
is uh you know putting the world in like
 

4375
01:27:55,159 --> 01:27:57,390
is uh you know putting the world in like
more concentration of power and few

4376
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:57,400
more concentration of power and few
 

4377
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:59,270
more concentration of power and few
individuals because not everyone's going

4378
01:27:59,270 --> 01:27:59,280
individuals because not everyone's going
 

4379
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,590
individuals because not everyone's going
to be able to afford this much amount of

4380
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:02,600
to be able to afford this much amount of
 

4381
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,229
to be able to afford this much amount of
compute to answer the hardest questions

4382
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
compute to answer the hardest questions
 

4383
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:08,870
compute to answer the hardest questions
so it's this incredible power that comes

4384
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:08,880
so it's this incredible power that comes
 

4385
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,109
so it's this incredible power that comes
with an AGI type system the concern is

4386
01:28:12,109 --> 01:28:12,119
with an AGI type system the concern is
 

4387
01:28:12,119 --> 01:28:13,790
with an AGI type system the concern is
who controls the computer on which the

4388
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:13,800
who controls the computer on which the
 

4389
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,310
who controls the computer on which the
AGI runs correct or rather who's even

4390
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:16,320
AGI runs correct or rather who's even
 

4391
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,629
AGI runs correct or rather who's even
able to afford

4392
01:28:17,629 --> 01:28:17,639
able to afford
 

4393
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:20,229
able to afford
it because like controlling the computer

4394
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:20,239
it because like controlling the computer
 

4395
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:21,709
it because like controlling the computer
might just be like cloud provider or

4396
01:28:21,709 --> 01:28:21,719
might just be like cloud provider or
 

4397
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:24,830
might just be like cloud provider or
something but um who's able to SP up a

4398
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:24,840
something but um who's able to SP up a
 

4399
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,390
something but um who's able to SP up a
job that just goes and says hey go do

01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:27,400
job that just goes and says hey go do
 

4401
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,950

this research and come back to me and

4402
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:28,960
this research and come back to me and
 

4403
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,910
this research and come back to me and
give me a great

4404
01:28:30,910 --> 01:28:30,920
give me a great

01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,390
give me a great
answer so to you AGI in part is compute

4406
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:34,400
answer so to you AGI in part is compute
 

4407
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,070
answer so to you AGI in part is compute

it's less about the pre-training or
 

4415
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:47,270
it's less about the pre-training or

4457
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:36,750
Transformer like paper you go like let's
say you're in

4458
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:36,760
say you're in
 

4459
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:41,109
say you're in
2016 and you asked uh Ani an

01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,390
AGI uh Hey I want to make everything a
lot more efficient I want to be able to

4464
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:45,400
lot more efficient I want to be able to
 

4465
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,590
lot more efficient I want to be able to
use the same amount of computer today

4466
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:46,600
use the same amount of computer today
 

4467
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,470
use the same amount of computer today
but end up with a model 100x better and

4468
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:49,480
but end up with a model 100x better and
 

4469
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:51,229
but end up with a model 100x better and
then the answer ended up being

4470
01:29:51,229 --> 01:29:51,239
then the answer ended up being
 

4471
01:29:51,239 --> 01:29:53,149
then the answer ended up being
Transformer but instead it was done by

would you be willing to pay uh $100

4482
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:04,800
would you be willing to pay uh $100
 

4483
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,470
would you be willing to pay uh $100
million for that one job yes but how

4484
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:07,480
million for that one job yes but how
 

4485
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,350
million for that one job yes but how
many people can afford $100 million for

4486
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,360
many people can afford $100 million for
 

4487
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,669
many people can afford $100 million for
one job very few some high netor

4488
01:30:12,669 --> 01:30:12,679
one job very few some high netor
 

4489
01:30:12,679 --> 01:30:14,270
one job very few some high netor
individuals and some really well

4490
01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:14,280
individuals and some really well
 

4491
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,390

4492
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:17,400
capitalized companies and Nations if it
 

4493
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,590
capitalized companies and Nations if it
turns to that correct where nations take

4494
01:30:19,590 --> 01:30:19,600
turns to that correct where nations take
 

4495
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,669
turns to that correct where nations take
control yeah so that is where we need to

4496
01:30:22,669 --> 01:30:22,679
control yeah so that is where we need to
 

4497
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:25,510
control yeah so that is where we need to

4525
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:56,430

uh no we made a trillion we paid a 100

4526
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:56,440
uh no we made a trillion we paid a 100
 

4527
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:00,990
uh no we made a trillion we paid a 100

4529
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,430

big leaps will be happening do you think

4530
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:02,440
big leaps will be happening do you think
 

4531
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:05,470
big leaps will be happening do you think
it'll be a series of small leaps like

4532
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:05,480
it'll be a series of small leaps like
 

4533
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:08,870
it'll be a series of small leaps like
the kind of stuff we saw with chbt with

4534
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:08,880
the kind of stuff we saw with chbt with
 

4535
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,950
the kind of stuff we saw with chbt with
rhf uh or is it is there going to be a

4536
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:11,960
rhf uh or is it is there going to be a
 

4537
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:14,709
rhf uh or is it is there going to be a
moment that's truly truly

4538
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:14,719
moment that's truly truly
 

4539
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,590
moment that's truly truly
transformational I don't think it'll be

4540
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:16,600
transformational I don't think it'll be
 

4541
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:19,590
transformational I don't think it'll be
like one single moment uh it doesn't

4542
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
like one single moment uh it doesn't
 

4543
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,149
like one single moment uh it doesn't
feel like that to me um maybe I'm wrong

4544
01:31:23,149 --> 01:31:23,159
feel like that to me um maybe I'm wrong
 

4545
01:31:23,159 --> 01:31:26,870
feel like that to me um maybe I'm wrong
here nobody nobody knows right but uh it

4546
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:26,880
here nobody nobody knows right but uh it
 

4547
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,310
here nobody nobody knows right but uh it
seems like it's limited by um a few

4548
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:30,320
seems like it's limited by um a few
 

4549
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,870
seems like it's limited by um a few
clever breakthroughs on like how to use

4550
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:32,880
clever breakthroughs on like how to use
 

4551
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,390
clever breakthroughs on like how to use
iterative

4552
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:34,400
iterative
 

4553
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:37,030
iterative
compute yeah and I have like

4554
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,040
compute yeah and I have like
 

4555
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,990
compute yeah and I have like
look it's clear that the more inference

4556
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,000
look it's clear that the more inference
 

4557
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,629
look it's clear that the more inference
computer you throw at an answer like

4558
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:42,639
computer you throw at an answer like
 

4559
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:44,950
computer you throw at an answer like
getting a good answer you can get better

4560
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:44,960
getting a good answer you can get better
 

4561
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,189
getting a good answer you can get better
answers but I've not seen anything

4562
01:31:47,189 --> 01:31:47,199
answers but I've not seen anything
 

4563
01:31:47,199 --> 01:31:50,310
answers but I've not seen anything
that's more like um oh take an answer

4564
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:50,320
that's more like um oh take an answer
 

4565
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:53,669
that's more like um oh take an answer
you don't even know if it's right um and

4566
01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:53,679
you don't even know if it's right um and
 

4567
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:55,430
you don't even know if it's right um and
and and like have some notion of

4568
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:55,440
and and like have some notion of
 

4569
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:58,229
and and like have some notion of
algorithmic Truth some logical

4570
01:31:58,229 --> 01:31:58,239
algorithmic Truth some logical
 

4571
01:31:58,239 --> 01:32:00,590
algorithmic Truth some logical
deductions and uh if let's say like

4572
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:00,600
deductions and uh if let's say like
 

4573
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,910
deductions and uh if let's say like
you're asking a question on uh the

4574
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:02,920
you're asking a question on uh the
 

4575
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:06,270
you're asking a question on uh the
origins of Co very controversial

4576
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:06,280

is something that can come and tell us

4582
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:14,639
is something that can come and tell us
 

4583
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,709
is something that can come and tell us
that the world's experts today are not

4584
01:32:16,709 --> 01:32:16,719
that the world's experts today are not
 

4585
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,430
that the world's experts today are not
telling us because they don't even know

4586
01:32:19,430 --> 01:32:19,440
telling us because they don't even know
 

4587
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:22,590
telling us because they don't even know
themselves so like a a measure of Truth

student in in in in an academic

4598
01:32:36,270 --> 01:32:36,280
student in in in in an academic
 

4599
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,669
student in in in in an academic
institution where the research paper was

4600
01:32:39,669 --> 01:32:39,679
institution where the research paper was
 

4601
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,629
institution where the research paper was
actually very very impactful so there's

4602
01:32:41,629 --> 01:32:41,639
actually very very impactful so there's
 

4603
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:44,189
actually very very impactful so there's
several things there one is impact and

4604
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:44,199
several things there one is impact and
 

4605
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:47,470
several things there one is impact and
one is truth yeah I I'm talking about

4606
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:47,480
one is truth yeah I I'm talking about
 

4607
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,109
one is truth yeah I I'm talking about
like like like real truth like to

4608
01:32:50,109 --> 01:32:50,119
like like like real truth like to
 

4609
01:32:50,119 --> 01:32:51,790
like like like real truth like to
questions that we don't

4610
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:51,800
questions that we don't
 

4611
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,189
questions that we don't
know and explain

4612
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:55,199
know and explain
 

4613
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,910
know and explain
itself and helping us like you know

4614
01:32:57,910 --> 01:32:57,920
itself and helping us like you know
 

4615
01:32:57,920 --> 01:32:59,790
itself and helping us like you know
understand what it like why it is a

4616
01:32:59,790 --> 01:32:59,800
understand what it like why it is a
 

4617
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,030
understand what it like why it is a
truth if we see some signs of this at

4618
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:03,040
truth if we see some signs of this at
 

4619
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,629
truth if we see some signs of this at
least for some hard questions that

4620
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:04,639
least for some hard questions that
 

4621
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:06,870
least for some hard questions that
puzzle us I'm not talking about like

4622
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:06,880
puzzle us I'm not talking about like
 

4623
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,990
puzzle us I'm not talking about like
things like it has to go and solve the

4624
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:09,000
things like it has to go and solve the
 

4625
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,390
things like it has to go and solve the
clay mathematics challenges you know

4626
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:12,400
clay mathematics challenges you know
 

4627
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:14,310
clay mathematics challenges you know
that's that's it's more like real

4628
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:14,320
that's that's it's more like real
 

4629
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,709
that's that's it's more like real
practical questions that are less

4630
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:16,719
practical questions that are less
 

4631
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,709
practical questions that are less
understood today uh if it can arrive at

4632
01:33:19,709 --> 01:33:19,719
understood today uh if it can arrive at
 

4633
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:21,070
understood today uh if it can arrive at
a better sense of

4634
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,080
a better sense of
 

4635
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:24,109
a better sense of
Truth uh and Elon has this St like thing

4636
01:33:24,109 --> 01:33:24,119
Truth uh and Elon has this St like thing
 

4637
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:25,950
Truth uh and Elon has this St like thing
right like can you can you build an AI

4638
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:25,960
right like can you can you build an AI
 

4639
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:28,189
right like can you can you build an AI
that that's like galileia or Copernicus

4640
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:28,199
that that's like galileia or Copernicus
 

4641
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:31,310
that that's like galileia or Copernicus
where uh it questions our current

4642
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:31,320
where uh it questions our current
 

4643
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:35,109
where uh it questions our current
understanding and comes up with a new uh

4644
01:33:35,109 --> 01:33:35,119
understanding and comes up with a new uh
 

4645
01:33:35,119 --> 01:33:37,790
understanding and comes up with a new uh
position which will be contrarian and

4646
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:37,800
position which will be contrarian and
 

4647
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,149
position which will be contrarian and
misunderstood but might end up being

4648
01:33:40,149 --> 01:33:40,159
misunderstood but might end up being
 

4649
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:42,830
misunderstood but might end up being
true and based on which especially if

4650
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:42,840
true and based on which especially if
 

4651
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,270
true and based on which especially if
it's like in the realm of physics you

4652
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:44,280
it's like in the realm of physics you
 

4653
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,070
it's like in the realm of physics you
can build a machine that does something

4654
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:46,080
can build a machine that does something
 

4655
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:47,790
can build a machine that does something
so like nuclear fusion it comes up with

4656
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:47,800
so like nuclear fusion it comes up with
 

4657
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:49,310
so like nuclear fusion it comes up with
a contradiction to our current

4658
01:33:49,310 --> 01:33:49,320
a contradiction to our current
 

4659
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,590
a contradiction to our current
understanding of physics that helps us

4660
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:50,600
understanding of physics that helps us
 

4661
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,950
understanding of physics that helps us
build a thing that generates a lot of

4662
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:52,960
build a thing that generates a lot of
 

4663
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,590
build a thing that generates a lot of
energy for example

4664
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:54,600
energy for example
 

4665
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:57,470
energy for example
or even something less dramatic yeah

4666
01:33:57,470 --> 01:33:57,480
or even something less dramatic yeah
 

4667
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:59,270
or even something less dramatic yeah
some mechanism some machine some

4668
01:33:59,270 --> 01:33:59,280
some mechanism some machine some
 

4669
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,709
some mechanism some machine some
something we can engineer and see like

4670
01:34:00,709 --> 01:34:00,719
something we can engineer and see like
 

4671
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,149
something we can engineer and see like
holy shit yeah this is an idea this is

4672
01:34:03,149 --> 01:34:03,159
holy shit yeah this is an idea this is
 

4673
01:34:03,159 --> 01:34:05,070
holy shit yeah this is an idea this is
not just a mathematical idea like it's a

4674
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:05,080
not just a mathematical idea like it's a
 

4675
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:07,950
not just a mathematical idea like it's a
ma uh theorem prover yeah and and like

4676
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:07,960
ma uh theorem prover yeah and and like
 

4677
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:09,350
ma uh theorem prover yeah and and like
like the answer should be so

4678
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:09,360
like the answer should be so
 

4679
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,830
like the answer should be so
mind-blowing that you never

4680
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:11,840
mind-blowing that you never
 

4681
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:14,669
mind-blowing that you never
even expected it although humans do this

4682
01:34:14,669 --> 01:34:14,679
even expected it although humans do this
 

4683
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:16,990
even expected it although humans do this
thing where they they've their mind gets

4684
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:17,000
thing where they they've their mind gets
 

4685
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,070
thing where they they've their mind gets

01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:22,189
blown they quickly
dismiss they quickly take it for granted

4688
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:22,199
dismiss they quickly take it for granted
 

4689
01:34:22,199 --> 01:34:24,109
dismiss they quickly take it for granted
you know because it's the other like the

4690
01:34:24,109 --> 01:34:24,119
you know because it's the other like the
 

4691
01:34:24,119 --> 01:34:27,270
you know because it's the other like the
as in system they'll they'll lessen its

01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,280
as in system they'll they'll lessen its
 

4693
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,709
as in system they'll they'll lessen its
power and value I mean there are some

4694
01:34:29,709 --> 01:34:29,719
power and value I mean there are some
 

4695
01:34:29,719 --> 01:34:31,590
power and value I mean there are some
beautiful algorithms humans have come up

4696
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:31,600
beautiful algorithms humans have come up
 

4697
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:34,430
beautiful algorithms humans have come up
but uh like like you're you have the

4698
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:34,440
but uh like like you're you have the
 

4699
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,229
but uh like like you're you have the
electric engineering background so you

4700
01:34:36,229 --> 01:34:36,239
electric engineering background so you
 

4701
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,870
electric engineering background so you
know like like U fast for your transform

4702
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:38,880
know like like U fast for your transform
 

4703
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,790
know like like U fast for your transform
discrete cosign transform right these

4704
01:34:40,790 --> 01:34:40,800
discrete cosign transform right these
 

4705
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,149
discrete cosign transform right these
are like really cool algorithms that are

4706
01:34:43,149 --> 01:34:43,159
are like really cool algorithms that are
 

4707
01:34:43,159 --> 01:34:46,709
are like really cool algorithms that are
so practical yet so simple in terms of

4708
01:34:46,709 --> 01:34:46,719
so practical yet so simple in terms of
 

4709
01:34:46,719 --> 01:34:48,830
so practical yet so simple in terms of
core Insight I wonder what if there's

4710
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:48,840
core Insight I wonder what if there's
 

4711
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,030
core Insight I wonder what if there's
like the top 10 algorithms of all time

4712
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:52,040
like the top 10 algorithms of all time
 

4713
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,149
like the top 10 algorithms of all time
like ffts are up there yeah

4714
01:34:54,149 --> 01:34:54,159
like ffts are up there yeah
 

4715
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:57,390
like ffts are up there yeah
I let's say let's keep the thing

4716
01:34:57,390 --> 01:34:57,400
I let's say let's keep the thing
 

4717
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:58,669
I let's say let's keep the thing
grounded to even the current

4718
01:34:58,669 --> 01:34:58,679
grounded to even the current
 

4719
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:00,990
grounded to even the current
conversation right like page rank page

4720
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:01,000
conversation right like page rank page
 

4721
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,990
conversation right like page rank page
rank yeah so these are the sort of

4722
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:03,000
rank yeah so these are the sort of
 

4723
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,590
rank yeah so these are the sort of
things that I I feel like AI are not AI

4724
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:05,600
things that I I feel like AI are not AI
 

4725
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,709
things that I I feel like AI are not AI
are not there yet to like truly come and

4726
01:35:07,709 --> 01:35:07,719
are not there yet to like truly come and
 

4727
01:35:07,719 --> 01:35:09,910
are not there yet to like truly come and
tell us hey hey hey Lex listen you're

4728
01:35:09,910 --> 01:35:09,920
tell us hey hey hey Lex listen you're
 

4729
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,390
tell us hey hey hey Lex listen you're
not supposed to look at text patterns

4730
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:12,400
not supposed to look at text patterns
 

4731
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,669
not supposed to look at text patterns
alone you you have to look at the link

4732
01:35:14,669 --> 01:35:14,679
alone you you have to look at the link
 

4733
01:35:14,679 --> 01:35:17,390
alone you you have to look at the link
structure like like that sort of a truth

4734
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:17,400
structure like like that sort of a truth
 

4735
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,910
structure like like that sort of a truth
I wonder if I'll be able to hear the AI

4736
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
I wonder if I'll be able to hear the AI
 

4737
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,149
I wonder if I'll be able to hear the AI
though like you mean the internal

4738
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:22,159
though like you mean the internal
 

4739
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,950
though like you mean the internal
reasoning the monologues no no no

4740
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:24,960
reasoning the monologues no no no
 

4741
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:28,070
reasoning the monologues no no no
if an AI tells me that uhhuh I I wonder

4742
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,080
if an AI tells me that uhhuh I I wonder
 

4743
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:29,350
if an AI tells me that uhhuh I I wonder
if I'll take it

4744
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:29,360
if I'll take it
 

4745
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,470
if I'll take it
seriously you may not and that's okay

4746
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:32,480
seriously you may not and that's okay
 

4747
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,990
seriously you may not and that's okay
but at least it'll force you to think

4748
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:35,000
but at least it'll force you to think
 

4749
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,790
but at least it'll force you to think
force me to think huh that that's

4750
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:37,800
force me to think huh that that's
 

4751
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,830
force me to think huh that that's
something I I didn't

4752
01:35:39,830 --> 01:35:39,840
something I I didn't
 

4753
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,870
something I I didn't
consider and like you'll be like okay

4754
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:41,880
consider and like you'll be like okay
 

4755
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:43,390
consider and like you'll be like okay
why should I like how how's it going to

4756
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:43,400
why should I like how how's it going to
 

4757
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,470
why should I like how how's it going to
help and then it's going to come and

4758
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:44,480
help and then it's going to come and
 

4759
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,510
help and then it's going to come and
explain no no no listen if you just look

4760
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:46,520
explain no no no listen if you just look
 

4761
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:47,790
explain no no no listen if you just look
at the text patterns you're going to

4762
01:35:47,790 --> 01:35:47,800
at the text patterns you're going to
 

4763
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:51,390
at the text patterns you're going to
overfit on like websites gaming you but

4764
01:35:51,390 --> 01:35:51,400
overfit on like websites gaming you but
 

4765
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:53,950
overfit on like websites gaming you but
instead you have an authority score now

4766
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:53,960
instead you have an authority score now
 

4767
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,550
instead you have an authority score now
that's a cool metric to optimize for is

4768
01:35:55,550 --> 01:35:55,560
that's a cool metric to optimize for is
 

4769
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:57,270
that's a cool metric to optimize for is
the number of times you make the user

4770
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:57,280
the number of times you make the user
 

4771
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:00,830
the number of times you make the user
think yeah like truly think yeah really

4772
01:36:00,830 --> 01:36:00,840
think yeah like truly think yeah really
 

4773
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:02,990
think yeah like truly think yeah really
think yeah and it's hard to measure

4774
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:03,000
think yeah and it's hard to measure
 

4775
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,669
think yeah and it's hard to measure
because you don't you don't really know

4776
01:36:04,669 --> 01:36:04,679
because you don't you don't really know
 

4777
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:08,149
because you don't you don't really know
they're like uh saying that you know on

4778
01:36:08,149 --> 01:36:08,159
they're like uh saying that you know on
 

4779
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:10,709
they're like uh saying that you know on
a frontend like this the timeline is

4780
01:36:10,709 --> 01:36:10,719
a frontend like this the timeline is
 

4781
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:14,229
a frontend like this the timeline is
best decided when we first see a sign of

4782
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:14,239
best decided when we first see a sign of
 

4783
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:15,830
best decided when we first see a sign of
something like

4784
01:36:15,830 --> 01:36:15,840
something like
 

4785
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,590
something like
this not saying at the level of impact

4786
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:18,600
this not saying at the level of impact
 

4787
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,350
this not saying at the level of impact
that page rank or any of the fast foror

4788
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:21,360
that page rank or any of the fast foror
 

4789
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,310
that page rank or any of the fast foror
transform something like that but even

4790
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:23,320
transform something like that but even
 

4791
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,790
transform something like that but even
just

4792
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:24,800
just
 

4793
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,149
just
at the level of a PhD student in an

4794
01:36:27,149 --> 01:36:27,159
at the level of a PhD student in an
 

4795
01:36:27,159 --> 01:36:29,430
at the level of a PhD student in an
academic lab not talking about the

01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,910
greatest PhD students or greatest
scientists like if we can get to that

4800
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:33,920
scientists like if we can get to that
 

4801
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:36,510
scientists like if we can get to that
then I think we can make a more accurate

4802
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:36,520
then I think we can make a more accurate
 

4803
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,030
then I think we can make a more accurate
estimation of the timeline today's

4804
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:39,040
estimation of the timeline today's
 

4805
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,629
estimation of the timeline today's
systems don't seem capable of doing

4806
01:36:40,629 --> 01:36:40,639
systems don't seem capable of doing
 

4807
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:44,149
systems don't seem capable of doing
anything of this nature so a truly new

4808
01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:44,159
anything of this nature so a truly new
 

4809
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:48,189
anything of this nature so a truly new
idea yeah or more in-depth understanding

4810
01:36:48,189 --> 01:36:48,199
idea yeah or more in-depth understanding
 

4811
01:36:48,199 --> 01:36:50,510
idea yeah or more in-depth understanding
of an existing like more in-depth

4812
01:36:50,510 --> 01:36:50,520
of an existing like more in-depth
 

4813
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,030
of an existing like more in-depth
understanding of the origins of

4814
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:52,040
understanding of the origins of
 

4815
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:54,550
understanding of the origins of
Co than what we have

4816
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:54,560
Co than what we have
 

4817
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,270
Co than what we have
today so that it's less about like

4818
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:57,280
today so that it's less about like
 

4819
01:36:57,280 --> 01:37:00,109
today so that it's less about like
arguments and ideologies and debates and

4820
01:37:00,109 --> 01:37:00,119
arguments and ideologies and debates and
 

4821
01:37:00,119 --> 01:37:02,910
arguments and ideologies and debates and
more about truth well I mean that one is

4822
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:02,920
more about truth well I mean that one is
 

4823
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:05,270
more about truth well I mean that one is
an interesting one because we humans are

4824
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:05,280
an interesting one because we humans are
 

4825
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,070
an interesting one because we humans are
we divide ourselves into camps and so it

4826
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:07,080
we divide ourselves into camps and so it
 

4827
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:09,189
we divide ourselves into camps and so it
becomes controversial so but why because

4828
01:37:09,189 --> 01:37:09,199
becomes controversial so but why because
 

4829
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:11,229
becomes controversial so but why because
we don't know the truth that's why I

4830
01:37:11,229 --> 01:37:11,239
we don't know the truth that's why I
 

4831
01:37:11,239 --> 01:37:13,430
we don't know the truth that's why I
know but what happens

4832
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:13,440
know but what happens
 

4833
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:16,430
know but what happens
is if an AI comes up with a deep truth

4834
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:16,440
is if an AI comes up with a deep truth
 

4835
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,270
is if an AI comes up with a deep truth
about

4836
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:18,280
about
 

4837
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,470
about
that humans will too quickly

4838
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:20,480
that humans will too quickly
 

4839
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:22,590
that humans will too quickly
unfortunately will politicize it

4840
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:22,600
unfortunately will politicize it
 

4841
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,910
unfortunately will politicize it
potentially they will say well this AI

4842
01:37:24,910 --> 01:37:24,920
potentially they will say well this AI
 

4843
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:27,950
potentially they will say well this AI
came up with that because if it goes

4844
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:27,960
came up with that because if it goes
 

4845
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:29,629
came up with that because if it goes
along with the leftwing narrative

4846
01:37:29,629 --> 01:37:29,639
along with the leftwing narrative
 

4847
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:32,270
along with the leftwing narrative
because it's still conv

4848
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:32,280
because it's still conv
 

4849
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,790
because it's still conv
valed yeah yeah so that that that that

4850
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800
valed yeah yeah so that that that that
 

4851
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,390
valed yeah yeah so that that that that
would be the knee-jerk reactions but I'm

4852
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:37,400
would be the knee-jerk reactions but I'm
 

4853
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,830
would be the knee-jerk reactions but I'm
talking about something that'll stand

4854
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:38,840
talking about something that'll stand
 

4855
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,390
talking about something that'll stand
the test of time yes yeah yeah yeah yeah

4856
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:41,400
the test of time yes yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

4857
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,990
the test of time yes yeah yeah yeah yeah
and maybe that's just like one

4858
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:43,000
and maybe that's just like one
 

4859
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,709
and maybe that's just like one
particular question let's let's assume a

4860
01:37:44,709 --> 01:37:44,719
particular question let's let's assume a
 

4861
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:46,350
particular question let's let's assume a
question that has nothing to do with

4862
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:46,360
question that has nothing to do with
 

4863
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,229
question that has nothing to do with
like how to Sol Parkinsons or like what

4864
01:37:49,229 --> 01:37:49,239
like how to Sol Parkinsons or like what
 

4865
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:50,550
like how to Sol Parkinsons or like what
whether something is really correlated

4866
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:50,560
whether something is really correlated
 

4867
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,950
whether something is really correlated
with something else whether oamic has

4868
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:52,960
with something else whether oamic has
 

4869
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,310
with something else whether oamic has
any like side effects these are the sort

4870
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:55,320
any like side effects these are the sort
 

4871
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:59,229
any like side effects these are the sort
of things that you know um I would want

4872
01:37:59,229 --> 01:37:59,239
of things that you know um I would want
 

4873
01:37:59,239 --> 01:38:02,229
of things that you know um I would want
like more insights from talking to an AI

4874
01:38:02,229 --> 01:38:02,239
like more insights from talking to an AI
 

4875
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:04,750
like more insights from talking to an AI
than than like the best human

4876
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:04,760
than than like the best human
 

4877
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:08,390
than than like the best human
doctor and today it doesn't seem like

4878
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:08,400
doctor and today it doesn't seem like
 

4879
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,189
doctor and today it doesn't seem like
that's the case that would be a cool

4880
01:38:10,189 --> 01:38:10,199
that's the case that would be a cool
 

4881
01:38:10,199 --> 01:38:14,390
that's the case that would be a cool
moment when an AI publicly

4882
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:14,400
moment when an AI publicly
 

4883
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,270
moment when an AI publicly
demonstrates a really new perspective on

4884
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:18,280
demonstrates a really new perspective on
 

4885
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:21,430
demonstrates a really new perspective on
a on a truth a discovery of a truth of a

novel truth yeah elon's trying to figure

4888
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:24,520
novel truth yeah elon's trying to figure
 

4889
01:38:24,520 --> 01:38:27,430
novel truth yeah elon's trying to figure
out the how to go to like Mars right and

4890
01:38:27,430 --> 01:38:27,440
out the how to go to like Mars right and
 

4891
01:38:27,440 --> 01:38:29,830
out the how to go to like Mars right and
like obviously redesigned from Falcon to

4892
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:29,840
like obviously redesigned from Falcon to
 

4893
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,149
like obviously redesigned from Falcon to
Starship if an AI had given him that

4894
01:38:32,149 --> 01:38:32,159
Starship if an AI had given him that
 

4895
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:33,709
Starship if an AI had given him that
Insight when he started the company

4896
01:38:33,709 --> 01:38:33,719
Insight when he started the company
 

4897
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:35,870
Insight when he started the company
itself said look Elon like I know you're

4898
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:35,880
itself said look Elon like I know you're
 

4899
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,030
itself said look Elon like I know you're
going to work hard on Falcon but the

4900
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:38,040
going to work hard on Falcon but the
 

4901
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:40,350
going to work hard on Falcon but the
right you need to redesign it for higher

4902
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:40,360
right you need to redesign it for higher
 

4903
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:43,550
right you need to redesign it for higher
payloads and and this is the way to go

4904
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:43,560
payloads and and this is the way to go
 

4905
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,030
payloads and and this is the way to go
that sort of uh thing will be way more

4906
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
that sort of uh thing will be way more
 

4907
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,669
that sort of uh thing will be way more
valuable and it it doesn't seem like

4908
01:38:51,669 --> 01:38:51,679
valuable and it it doesn't seem like
 

4909
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,070
valuable and it it doesn't seem like
it's easy to estimate when it will

4910
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:54,080
it's easy to estimate when it will
 

4911
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:56,390
it's easy to estimate when it will
happen all all we can say for sure is

4912
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:56,400
happen all all we can say for sure is
 

4913
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,470
happen all all we can say for sure is
it's likely to happen at some point

4914
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:58,480
it's likely to happen at some point
 

4915
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,830
it's likely to happen at some point
there's nothing fundamentally Impossible

4916
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:00,840
there's nothing fundamentally Impossible
 

4917
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:02,589
there's nothing fundamentally Impossible
about designing system of this nature

4918
01:39:02,589 --> 01:39:02,599
about designing system of this nature
 

4919
01:39:02,599 --> 01:39:04,229
about designing system of this nature
and when it happens it'll have

4920
01:39:04,229 --> 01:39:04,239
and when it happens it'll have
 

4921
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,910
and when it happens it'll have
incredible incredible impact that's true

4922
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:06,920
incredible incredible impact that's true
 

4923
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:10,430
incredible incredible impact that's true
yeah if you have a high power thinkers

4924
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:10,440
yeah if you have a high power thinkers
 

4925
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,390
yeah if you have a high power thinkers
like Elon or I imagine would have had

4926
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:13,400
like Elon or I imagine would have had
 

4927
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,629
like Elon or I imagine would have had
conversation with ilas like just talking

4928
01:39:15,629 --> 01:39:15,639
conversation with ilas like just talking
 

4929
01:39:15,639 --> 01:39:18,470
conversation with ilas like just talking
about any topic yeah you're like the

4930
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
about any topic yeah you're like the
 

4931
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,109
about any topic yeah you're like the
ability to think through a thing I mean

4932
01:39:20,109 --> 01:39:20,119
ability to think through a thing I mean
 

4933
01:39:20,119 --> 01:39:21,790
ability to think through a thing I mean
you mentioned PhD student we can just go

4934
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:21,800
you mentioned PhD student we can just go
 

4935
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:25,709
you mentioned PhD student we can just go
to that but to have an AI system that

4936
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:25,719
to that but to have an AI system that
 

4937
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:29,470
to that but to have an AI system that
can legitimately be an assistant to ilas

4938
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:29,480
can legitimately be an assistant to ilas
 

4939
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:31,629
can legitimately be an assistant to ilas
or Andre Kathy when they're thinking

4940
01:39:31,629 --> 01:39:31,639
or Andre Kathy when they're thinking
 

4941
01:39:31,639 --> 01:39:34,669
or Andre Kathy when they're thinking
through an idea yeah yeah like if you

4942
01:39:34,669 --> 01:39:34,679
through an idea yeah yeah like if you
 

4943
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:38,790
through an idea yeah yeah like if you
had an AI Ilia or an AI Andre not

4944
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:38,800
had an AI Ilia or an AI Andre not
 

4945
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,709
had an AI Ilia or an AI Andre not
exactly like you know in the

4946
01:39:40,709 --> 01:39:40,719
exactly like you know in the
 

4947
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:45,390
exactly like you know in the
anthropomorphic way yes but uh a session

4948
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:45,400
anthropomorphic way yes but uh a session
 

4949
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:48,589
anthropomorphic way yes but uh a session
like even a half an hour chat with that

4950
01:39:48,589 --> 01:39:48,599
like even a half an hour chat with that
 

4951
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:52,149
like even a half an hour chat with that
AI for completely changed the way you

4952
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:52,159
AI for completely changed the way you
 

4953
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:55,109
AI for completely changed the way you
thought about your current problem

4954
01:39:55,109 --> 01:39:55,119
thought about your current problem
 

4955
01:39:55,119 --> 01:39:57,629
thought about your current problem
that is so valuable what do you think

4956
01:39:57,629 --> 01:39:57,639
that is so valuable what do you think
 

4957
01:39:57,639 --> 01:40:00,470
that is so valuable what do you think
happens if we have those two AIS and we

4958
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:00,480
happens if we have those two AIS and we
 

4959
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:02,589
happens if we have those two AIS and we
create a million copies of each we have

4960
01:40:02,589 --> 01:40:02,599
create a million copies of each we have
 

4961
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:06,189
create a million copies of each we have
a million ilas and a million Andre Kath

4962
01:40:06,189 --> 01:40:06,199
a million ilas and a million Andre Kath
 

4963
01:40:06,199 --> 01:40:07,149
a million ilas and a million Andre Kath
they're talking to each other they're

4964
01:40:07,149 --> 01:40:07,159
they're talking to each other they're
 

4965
01:40:07,159 --> 01:40:08,589
they're talking to each other they're
talking to each other that would be cool

4966
01:40:08,589 --> 01:40:08,599
talking to each other that would be cool
 

4967
01:40:08,599 --> 01:40:10,990
talking to each other that would be cool
I mean I yeah that's a selfplay idea

4968
01:40:10,990 --> 01:40:11,000
I mean I yeah that's a selfplay idea
 

4969
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,030
I mean I yeah that's a selfplay idea
right and uh I I I think I think that's

4970
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:15,040
right and uh I I I think I think that's
 

4971
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,589
right and uh I I I think I think that's
where where it gets interesting where

4972
01:40:16,589 --> 01:40:16,599
where where it gets interesting where
 

4973
01:40:16,599 --> 01:40:18,589
where where it gets interesting where
could end up being an echo chamber too

4974
01:40:18,589 --> 01:40:18,599
could end up being an echo chamber too
 

4975
01:40:18,599 --> 01:40:20,310
could end up being an echo chamber too
right they just saying the same things

4976
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:20,320
right they just saying the same things
 

4977
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:24,189
right they just saying the same things
and it's boring uh all it could be like

4978
01:40:24,189 --> 01:40:24,199
and it's boring uh all it could be like
 

4979
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:27,229
and it's boring uh all it could be like
you could uh like within the Andre AIS I

4980
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:27,239
you could uh like within the Andre AIS I
 

4981
01:40:27,239 --> 01:40:28,669
you could uh like within the Andre AIS I
mean I feel like there would be clusters

4982
01:40:28,669 --> 01:40:28,679
mean I feel like there would be clusters
 

4983
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:30,790
mean I feel like there would be clusters
right no you you need to insert some

4984
01:40:30,790 --> 01:40:30,800
right no you you need to insert some
 

4985
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,149
right no you you need to insert some
element of like like random seeds where

4986
01:40:34,149 --> 01:40:34,159
element of like like random seeds where
 

4987
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:36,510
element of like like random seeds where
uh even though the the core intelligence

4988
01:40:36,510 --> 01:40:36,520
uh even though the the core intelligence
 

4989
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:39,270
uh even though the the core intelligence
capabilities are the same level uh they

4990
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:39,280
capabilities are the same level uh they
 

4991
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,030
capabilities are the same level uh they
have like different

4992
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:41,040
have like different
 

4993
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,430
have like different
worldviews and and and and and because

4994
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
worldviews and and and and and because
 

4995
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,109
worldviews and and and and and because
of that it forces the some element of

4996
01:40:47,109 --> 01:40:47,119
of that it forces the some element of
 

4997
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,870
of that it forces the some element of
new signal to arrive at like both are

4998
01:40:49,870 --> 01:40:49,880
new signal to arrive at like both are
 

4999
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:51,070
new signal to arrive at like both are
truth seeking but they have different

5000
01:40:51,070 --> 01:40:51,080
truth seeking but they have different
 

5001
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:52,870
truth seeking but they have different
World Views or like you know different

5002
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:52,880
World Views or like you know different
 

5003
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,510
World Views or like you know different
perspective because they are there's

5004
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:54,520
perspective because they are there's
 

5005
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,149
perspective because they are there's
some ambiguity about the fundamental

5006
01:40:57,149 --> 01:40:57,159
some ambiguity about the fundamental
 

5007
01:40:57,159 --> 01:40:59,390
some ambiguity about the fundamental
things and that could ensure that like

5008
01:40:59,390 --> 01:40:59,400
things and that could ensure that like
 

5009
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:00,669
things and that could ensure that like
you know both of them arrive with new

5010
01:41:00,669 --> 01:41:00,679
you know both of them arrive with new
 

5011
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:02,430
you know both of them arrive with new
truth it's not clear how to do all this

5012
01:41:02,430 --> 01:41:02,440
truth it's not clear how to do all this
 

5013
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:04,750
truth it's not clear how to do all this
without hardcoding these things yourself

5014
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:04,760
without hardcoding these things yourself
 

5015
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:06,390
without hardcoding these things yourself
right so you have to somehow not

5016
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:06,400
right so you have to somehow not
 

5017
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:10,310
right so you have to somehow not
hardcode the Curiosity aspect EXA and

5018
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:10,320
hardcode the Curiosity aspect EXA and
 

5019
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:11,550
hardcode the Curiosity aspect EXA and
and that's why this whole selfplay

5020
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:11,560
and that's why this whole selfplay
 

5021
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:13,350
and that's why this whole selfplay
things doesn't seem very easy to scale

5022
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:13,360
things doesn't seem very easy to scale
 

5023
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:13,990
things doesn't seem very easy to scale
right

5024
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:14,000
right
 

5025
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,109
right
now I love all the tangents we took but

5026
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:17,119
now I love all the tangents we took but
 

5027
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:19,470
now I love all the tangents we took but
let's return to the beginning what's the

5028
01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:19,480
let's return to the beginning what's the
 

5029
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:21,149
let's return to the beginning what's the
uh origin story of

5030
01:41:21,149 --> 01:41:21,159
uh origin story of
 

5031
01:41:21,159 --> 01:41:23,629
uh origin story of
perplexity yeah so you know I got

5032
01:41:23,629 --> 01:41:23,639
perplexity yeah so you know I got
 

5033
01:41:23,639 --> 01:41:25,910
perplexity yeah so you know I got
together with my co-founders Dennis and

5034
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:25,920
together with my co-founders Dennis and
 

5035
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:28,149
together with my co-founders Dennis and
Johnny and all we wanted to do was build

5036
01:41:28,149 --> 01:41:28,159
Johnny and all we wanted to do was build
 

5037
01:41:28,159 --> 01:41:31,870
Johnny and all we wanted to do was build
cool products with llms um it was a time

5038
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:31,880
cool products with llms um it was a time
 

5039
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:34,470
cool products with llms um it was a time
when it wasn't clear where the value

5040
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:34,480
when it wasn't clear where the value
 

5041
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,229
when it wasn't clear where the value
would be created is it in the model or

5042
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:36,239
would be created is it in the model or
 

5043
01:41:36,239 --> 01:41:39,629
would be created is it in the model or
is it in the product but one thing was

5044
01:41:39,629 --> 01:41:39,639
is it in the product but one thing was
 

5045
01:41:39,639 --> 01:41:42,629
is it in the product but one thing was
clear these generative models are

5046
01:41:42,629 --> 01:41:42,639
clear these generative models are
 

5047
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:45,070
clear these generative models are
transcended from just being research

5048
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:45,080
transcended from just being research
 

5049
01:41:45,080 --> 01:41:48,109
transcended from just being research
projects to actual user-facing

5050
01:41:48,109 --> 01:41:48,119
projects to actual user-facing
 

5051
01:41:48,119 --> 01:41:51,310
projects to actual user-facing
applications uh GitHub co-pilot was

5052
01:41:51,310 --> 01:41:51,320
applications uh GitHub co-pilot was
 

5053
01:41:51,320 --> 01:41:53,510
applications uh GitHub co-pilot was
being used by a lot of people and and I

5054
01:41:53,510 --> 01:41:53,520
being used by a lot of people and and I
 

5055
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,550
being used by a lot of people and and I
was using it myself and I saw a lot of

5056
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:55,560
was using it myself and I saw a lot of
 

5057
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:57,790
was using it myself and I saw a lot of
people around me using it Andre karpati

5058
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:57,800
people around me using it Andre karpati
 

5059
01:41:57,800 --> 01:42:01,030
people around me using it Andre karpati
was using it people were paying for it

5060
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:01,040
was using it people were paying for it
 

5061
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,030
was using it people were paying for it
so this was a moment unlike any other

5062
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:04,040
so this was a moment unlike any other
 

5063
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,589
so this was a moment unlike any other
moment before where uh people were

5064
01:42:06,589 --> 01:42:06,599
moment before where uh people were
 

5065
01:42:06,599 --> 01:42:08,149
moment before where uh people were
having AI companies where they they

5066
01:42:08,149 --> 01:42:08,159
having AI companies where they they
 

5067
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:09,510
having AI companies where they they
would just keep collecting a lot of data

5068
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:09,520
would just keep collecting a lot of data
 

5069
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,270
would just keep collecting a lot of data
but then it would be a small part of

5070
01:42:12,270 --> 01:42:12,280
but then it would be a small part of
 

5071
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:15,430
but then it would be a small part of
something bigger but for the first time

5072
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:15,440
something bigger but for the first time
 

5073
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:17,629
something bigger but for the first time
AI itself was the thing so to you that

5074
01:42:17,629 --> 01:42:17,639
AI itself was the thing so to you that
 

5075
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:20,589
AI itself was the thing so to you that
was an inspiration copilot as a product

5076
01:42:20,589 --> 01:42:20,599
was an inspiration copilot as a product
 

5077
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:23,350
was an inspiration copilot as a product
yeah so GitHub copil Copilot people

5078
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:23,360
yeah so GitHub copil Copilot people
 

5079
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,750
yeah so GitHub copil Copilot people
don't know it's assist you in

5080
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:25,760
don't know it's assist you in
 

5081
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,390
don't know it's assist you in
programming it generates code for you

5082
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,400
programming it generates code for you
 

5083
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,669
programming it generates code for you
yeah and I mean you can just call it a

5084
01:42:30,669 --> 01:42:30,679
yeah and I mean you can just call it a
 

5085
01:42:30,679 --> 01:42:33,109
yeah and I mean you can just call it a
fancy auto complete it's fine except it

5086
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:33,119
fancy auto complete it's fine except it
 

5087
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:35,910
fancy auto complete it's fine except it
actually worked at a deeper level than

5088
01:42:35,910 --> 01:42:35,920
actually worked at a deeper level than
 

5089
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,470
actually worked at a deeper level than
before yeah

5090
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:38,480
before yeah
 

5091
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:42,870
before yeah
and one property I wanted for a company

5092
01:42:42,870 --> 01:42:42,880
and one property I wanted for a company
 

5093
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:47,310
and one property I wanted for a company
I started was it has to be AI

5094
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:47,320
I started was it has to be AI
 

5095
01:42:47,320 --> 01:42:49,430
I started was it has to be AI
complete this is something I took from

5096
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:49,440
complete this is something I took from
 

5097
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,790
complete this is something I took from
Larry Page which

5098
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:50,800
Larry Page which
 

5099
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,270
Larry Page which
is you want to identify a problem where

5100
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:54,280
is you want to identify a problem where
 

5101
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:57,350
is you want to identify a problem where
if you worked on it you would benefit

5102
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,360
if you worked on it you would benefit
 

5103
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:01,030
if you worked on it you would benefit
from the advances made in AI the product

5104
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:01,040
from the advances made in AI the product
 

5105
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:03,550
from the advances made in AI the product
would get better

5106
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:03,560
would get better
 

5107
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:06,310
would get better
and because the product gets better more

5108
01:43:06,310 --> 01:43:06,320
and because the product gets better more
 

5109
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:10,149
and because the product gets better more
people use it and therefore that helps

5110
01:43:10,149 --> 01:43:10,159
people use it and therefore that helps
 

5111
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:12,430
people use it and therefore that helps
you to create more data for the AI to

5112
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:12,440
you to create more data for the AI to
 

5113
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:14,790
you to create more data for the AI to
get better and that makes the product

5114
01:43:14,790 --> 01:43:14,800
get better and that makes the product
 

5115
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,149
get better and that makes the product
better that creates the flywheel it's

5116
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:17,159
better that creates the flywheel it's
 

5117
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:19,189
better that creates the flywheel it's
not easy

5118
01:43:19,189 --> 01:43:19,199
not easy
 

5119
01:43:19,199 --> 01:43:22,430
not easy
to uh have this property for most

5120
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:22,440
to uh have this property for most
 

5121
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,709
to uh have this property for most
companies don't have this property

5122
01:43:24,709 --> 01:43:24,719
companies don't have this property
 

5123
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:26,070
companies don't have this property
that's why they're all struggling to

5124
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:26,080
that's why they're all struggling to
 

5125
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,709
that's why they're all struggling to
identify where they can use AI it should

5126
01:43:28,709 --> 01:43:28,719
identify where they can use AI it should
 

5127
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,270
identify where they can use AI it should
be obvious where you should be able to

5128
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:30,280
be obvious where you should be able to
 

5129
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:32,910
be obvious where you should be able to
use Ai and there are two products that I

5130
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:32,920
use Ai and there are two products that I
 

5131
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:38,270
use Ai and there are two products that I
feel truly nail this one is Google

5132
01:43:38,270 --> 01:43:38,280
feel truly nail this one is Google

01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:40,830
feel truly nail this one is Google

not General on GitHub and some national

5308
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:20,000
not General on GitHub and some national
 

5309
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:23,310
not General on GitHub and some national
language so you it's it's like you

5310
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:23,320
language so you it's it's like you
 

5311
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,910
language so you it's it's like you
should consider it was like programming

5312
01:47:24,910 --> 01:47:24,920
should consider it was like programming
 

5313
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:26,709
should consider it was like programming
with computers that had like very little

5314
01:47:26,709 --> 01:47:26,719
with computers that had like very little
 

5315
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:29,430
with computers that had like very little
Ram it's a lot of hard coding like my

5316
01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:29,440
Ram it's a lot of hard coding like my
 

5317
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,390
Ram it's a lot of hard coding like my
co-founders and I would just write a lot

5318
01:47:31,390 --> 01:47:31,400
co-founders and I would just write a lot
 

5319
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:34,390
co-founders and I would just write a lot
of templates ourselves for like this

5320
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:34,400
of templates ourselves for like this
 

5321
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,030
of templates ourselves for like this
query this is a SQL this query this is a

5322
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:36,040
query this is a SQL this query this is a
 

5323
01:47:36,040 --> 01:47:39,109
query this is a SQL this query this is a
SQL we would learn SQL ourselves this

5324
01:47:39,109 --> 01:47:39,119
SQL we would learn SQL ourselves this
 

5325
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:40,750
SQL we would learn SQL ourselves this
also why we built this generic question

5326
01:47:40,750 --> 01:47:40,760
also why we built this generic question
 

5327
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:42,430
also why we built this generic question
answering bot because we didn't know SQL

5328
01:47:42,430 --> 01:47:42,440
answering bot because we didn't know SQL
 

5329
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:46,990
answering bot because we didn't know SQL
that well ourselves yeah so um and then

5330
01:47:46,990 --> 01:47:47,000
that well ourselves yeah so um and then
 

5331
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,550
that well ourselves yeah so um and then
we would do rag given the query we would

5332
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:49,560
we would do rag given the query we would
 

5333
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:51,750
we would do rag given the query we would
pull up templates that were you know

5334
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:51,760
pull up templates that were you know
 

5335
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:54,589
pull up templates that were you know
similar looking template queries mhm and

5336
01:47:54,589 --> 01:47:54,599
similar looking template queries mhm and
 

5337
01:47:54,599 --> 01:47:56,350
similar looking template queries mhm and
the system would see that build a

5338
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:56,360
the system would see that build a
 

5339
01:47:56,360 --> 01:47:58,589
the system would see that build a
dynamic fuse shot prompt and write a new

5340
01:47:58,589 --> 01:47:58,599
dynamic fuse shot prompt and write a new
 

5341
01:47:58,599 --> 01:48:01,709
dynamic fuse shot prompt and write a new
query for the query you asked and

5342
01:48:01,709 --> 01:48:01,719
query for the query you asked and
 

5343
01:48:01,719 --> 01:48:04,470
query for the query you asked and
executed against the database M and many

5344
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:04,480
executed against the database M and many
 

5345
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,109
executed against the database M and many
things would still go wrong like

5346
01:48:06,109 --> 01:48:06,119
things would still go wrong like
 

5347
01:48:06,119 --> 01:48:07,550
things would still go wrong like
sometimes the SQL would be erronous you

5348
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:07,560
sometimes the SQL would be erronous you
 

5349
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:11,109
sometimes the SQL would be erronous you
to catch errors it to do like retries so

5350
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:11,119
to catch errors it to do like retries so
 

5351
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:14,750
to catch errors it to do like retries so
we built all this into uh a good search

5352
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:14,760
we built all this into uh a good search
 

5353
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:17,030
we built all this into uh a good search
experience over Twitter which was create

5354
01:48:17,030 --> 01:48:17,040
experience over Twitter which was create
 

5355
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,390
experience over Twitter which was create
with academic accounts before Elon took

5356
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:19,400
with academic accounts before Elon took
 

5357
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:23,430
with academic accounts before Elon took
over Twitter so we you know then Twitter

5358
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:23,440
over Twitter so we you know then Twitter
 

5359
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:26,390
over Twitter so we you know then Twitter
would allow you to create academic API

5360
01:48:26,390 --> 01:48:26,400
would allow you to create academic API
 

5361
01:48:26,400 --> 01:48:28,669
would allow you to create academic API
accounts and we would create like lots

5362
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:28,679
accounts and we would create like lots
 

5363
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:30,470
accounts and we would create like lots
of them with like generating phone

5364
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:30,480
of them with like generating phone
 

5365
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:32,790
of them with like generating phone
numbers like writing research proposals

5366
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:32,800
numbers like writing research proposals
 

5367
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,470

with
 

5369
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:37,470
with
GPT and like I would call my projects as

5370
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:37,480
GPT and like I would call my projects as
 

5371
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:39,350
GPT and like I would call my projects as
like Brin Rank and all these kind of

5372
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:39,360
like Brin Rank and all these kind of
 

5373
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:42,510
like Brin Rank and all these kind of
things um and then like uh create all

5374
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:42,520
things um and then like uh create all
 

5375
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,070
things um and then like uh create all
these like fake academic accounts

5376

basically Twitter is a gigantic social
 

5381
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,189
basically Twitter is a gigantic social
graph but we decided to focus it on

01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
graph but we decided to focus it on
 

5383
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:53,470
graph but we decided to focus it on
interesting individuals because the

5384
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:53,480
interesting individuals because the
 

5385
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,229
interesting individuals because the
value of the graph is still like you

5386

curiosity right
and that ended up helping us to recruit

5416
01:49:31,629 --> 01:49:31,639
and that ended up helping us to recruit
 

5417
01:49:31,639 --> 01:49:34,629
and that ended up helping us to recruit
good people because nobody took me or my

good people because nobody took me or my
 

5419
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:36,750
good people because nobody took me or my
co-founders that seriously but because

5420
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:36,760
co-founders that seriously but because
 

5421
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:38,589
co-founders that seriously but because
we were backed by interesting

started sharing screenshots of that and
Discord forums and stuff and that's what

5544
01:52:06,709 --> 01:52:06,719
Discord forums and stuff and that's what
 

5545
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:08,830
Discord forums and stuff and that's what
led to like this initial growth when

5546
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:08,840
led to like this initial growth when
 

5547
01:52:08,840 --> 01:52:11,790
led to like this initial growth when
like you're completely irrelevant MH to

5548
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:11,800
like you're completely irrelevant MH to
 

5549
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,830
like you're completely irrelevant MH to
like at least some amount of relevance

5550
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:13,840
like at least some amount of relevance
 

5551
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:15,229
like at least some amount of relevance
but we knew that's not like that's like

5552
01:52:15,229 --> 01:52:15,239
but we knew that's not like that's like
 

5553
01:52:15,239 --> 01:52:17,270
but we knew that's not like that's like
a onetime thing it's not like every way

5554
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:17,280
a onetime thing it's not like every way
 

5555
01:52:17,280 --> 01:52:20,350
a onetime thing it's not like every way
is a repetitive query but at least uh

5556
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:20,360
is a repetitive query but at least uh
 

5557
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,990
is a repetitive query but at least uh
that gave us the confidence that there

5558
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:22,000
that gave us the confidence that there
 

5559
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,990
that gave us the confidence that there
is something to pulling up links and

5560
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:24,000
is something to pulling up links and
 

5561
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,510
is something to pulling up links and
summarizing it MH and we decided to

5562
01:52:26,510 --> 01:52:26,520
summarizing it MH and we decided to
 

5563
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,109
summarizing it MH and we decided to
focus on that and obviously we knew that

5564
01:52:28,109 --> 01:52:28,119
focus on that and obviously we knew that
 

5565
01:52:28,119 --> 01:52:30,510
focus on that and obviously we knew that
this Twitter search thing was not uh

5566
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:30,520
this Twitter search thing was not uh
 

5567
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:33,390
this Twitter search thing was not uh
scalable or doable for us because Elon

5568
01:52:33,390 --> 01:52:33,400
scalable or doable for us because Elon
 

5569
01:52:33,400 --> 01:52:35,470
scalable or doable for us because Elon
was taking over and the he was very

5570
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:35,480
was taking over and the he was very
 

5571
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:36,830
was taking over and the he was very
particular that like he's going to shut

5572
01:52:36,830 --> 01:52:36,840
particular that like he's going to shut
 

5573
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:40,350
particular that like he's going to shut
down API access a lot and so it made

5574
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:40,360
down API access a lot and so it made
 

5575
01:52:40,360 --> 01:52:41,830
down API access a lot and so it made
sense for us to focus more on regular

5576
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:41,840
sense for us to focus more on regular
 

5577
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:45,470
sense for us to focus more on regular
search that's a big thing to take on web

5578
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:45,480
search that's a big thing to take on web
 

5579

the early steps to do that like what's

5582
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:50,440
the early steps to do that like what's
 

5583
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:54,709
the early steps to do that like what's
required to take on web search

5584
01:52:54,709 --> 01:52:54,719

 

5585
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:57,229

honestly I the way we thought about it

5586
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:57,239
honestly I the way we thought about it
 

5587
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,910
honestly I the way we thought about it
was let's release this there's nothing

5588
01:52:59,910 --> 01:52:59,920
was let's release this there's nothing
 

5589
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:00,669
was let's release this there's nothing
to

5595
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:08,790
people are going to like it and maybe
some Enterprises will talk to us and ask

5596
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:08,800
some Enterprises will talk to us and ask
 

5597
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,390
some Enterprises will talk to us and ask
for something of this nature for their

5598
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:10,400
for something of this nature for their
 

5599
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,950
for something of this nature for their
internal data and maybe we could use

5600
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:12,960
internal data and maybe we could use
 

5601
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,990
internal data and maybe we could use
that to build a business that was the

5602
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:15,000
that to build a business that was the
 

5603
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,950
that to build a business that was the
extent of our ambition that's why like

doing
it's almost like

5612
01:53:24,709 --> 01:53:24,719
it's almost like
 

5613
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:27,109
it's almost like
accidental so for us the way it worked

5614
01:53:27,109 --> 01:53:27,119
accidental so for us the way it worked
 

5615
01:53:27,119 --> 01:53:31,270
accidental so for us the way it worked
was we put it put this out and a lot of

5619
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,189
people started using it I thought okay
it's just a fat and you know the usage

5620

the will so can you speak to the
technical details of how perplexity

5780
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:30,400
technical details of how perplexity
 

5781
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:32,430
technical details of how perplexity
Works you've mentioned already rag

5782
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:32,440
Works you've mentioned already rag
 

5783
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:35,069
Works you've mentioned already rag
retrieval augmented generation what are

5784
01:56:35,069 --> 01:56:35,079
retrieval augmented generation what are
 

5785
01:56:35,079 --> 01:56:36,830
retrieval augmented generation what are
the different components here how does

5786
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:36,840
the different components here how does
 

5787
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:39,390
the different components here how does
the search happen first of all what is

5788
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:39,400
the search happen first of all what is
 

5789
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:43,069
the search happen first of all what is
rag yeah what does the llm do at at at a

5790
01:56:43,069 --> 01:56:43,079
rag yeah what does the llm do at at at a
 

5791
01:56:43,079 --> 01:56:44,629
rag yeah what does the llm do at at at a
high level how does the thing work yeah

5792
01:56:44,629 --> 01:56:44,639
high level how does the thing work yeah
 

5793
01:56:44,639 --> 01:56:47,149
high level how does the thing work yeah
so rag is retrieval augmented generation

5794
01:56:47,149 --> 01:56:47,159
so rag is retrieval augmented generation
 

5795
01:56:47,159 --> 01:56:47,990
so rag is retrieval augmented generation
simple

5796
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:48,000
simple
 

5797
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,629
simple
framework given a query always retrieve

5798
01:56:50,629 --> 01:56:50,639
framework given a query always retrieve
 

5799
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:53,510
framework given a query always retrieve
relevant documents and pick relevant

5800
01:56:53,510 --> 01:56:53,520
relevant documents and pick relevant
 

5801
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:56,750
relevant documents and pick relevant
paragraphs from each document and use

5802
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:56,760
paragraphs from each document and use
 

5803
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:59,950
paragraphs from each document and use
those documents and paragraphs to write

5804
01:56:59,950 --> 01:56:59,960
those documents and paragraphs to write
 

5805
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:02,470
those documents and paragraphs to write
your answer for that query MH the

5806
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:02,480
your answer for that query MH the
 

5807
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,069
your answer for that query MH the
principle and perplexity is you're not

5808
01:57:04,069 --> 01:57:04,079
principle and perplexity is you're not
 

5809
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:05,790
principle and perplexity is you're not
supposed to say anything that you don't

5810
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:05,800
supposed to say anything that you don't
 

5811
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:08,430
supposed to say anything that you don't
retrieve MH which is even more powerful

5812
01:57:08,430 --> 01:57:08,440
retrieve MH which is even more powerful
 

5813
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:10,990
retrieve MH which is even more powerful
than rag because rag just says okay use

5814
01:57:10,990 --> 01:57:11,000
than rag because rag just says okay use
 

5815
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,430
than rag because rag just says okay use
this additional context and and and

5816
01:57:13,430 --> 01:57:13,440
this additional context and and and
 

5817
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:15,189
this additional context and and and
write an answer but we say don't use

5818
01:57:15,189 --> 01:57:15,199
write an answer but we say don't use
 

5819
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:17,510
write an answer but we say don't use
anything more than that too that way we

5820
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,520
anything more than that too that way we
 

5821
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,910
anything more than that too that way we
ensure factual grounding and if you

5822
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:19,920
ensure factual grounding and if you
 

5823
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,669
ensure factual grounding and if you
don't have enough information from

5824
01:57:22,669 --> 01:57:22,679
don't have enough information from
 

5825
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:25,030
don't have enough information from
documents you retrieve just say we don't

5826
01:57:25,030 --> 01:57:25,040
documents you retrieve just say we don't
 

5827
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,669
documents you retrieve just say we don't
have enough search results to give you a

5828
01:57:26,669 --> 01:57:26,679
have enough search results to give you a
 

5829
01:57:26,679 --> 01:57:28,830
have enough search results to give you a
good answer yeah let's just Ling on that

5830
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:28,840
good answer yeah let's just Ling on that
 

5831
01:57:28,840 --> 01:57:32,390
good answer yeah let's just Ling on that
so in general rag is doing the search

5832
01:57:32,390 --> 01:57:32,400
so in general rag is doing the search
 

5833
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:35,910
so in general rag is doing the search
part with the query to add extra context

5834
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:35,920
part with the query to add extra context
 

5835
01:57:35,920 --> 01:57:39,709
part with the query to add extra context
yeah to generate a uh a better answer I

5836
01:57:39,709 --> 01:57:39,719
yeah to generate a uh a better answer I
 

5837
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:41,790
yeah to generate a uh a better answer I
suppose you're saying like you want to

5838
01:57:41,790 --> 01:57:41,800
suppose you're saying like you want to
 

5839
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:45,270
suppose you're saying like you want to
really stick to the truth that is

5840
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:45,280
really stick to the truth that is
 

5841
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:47,149
really stick to the truth that is
represented by the human written text on

5842
01:57:47,149 --> 01:57:47,159
represented by the human written text on
 

5843
01:57:47,159 --> 01:57:49,830
represented by the human written text on
the internet and then cite it to that

5844
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:49,840
the internet and then cite it to that
 

5845
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:51,629
the internet and then cite it to that
text correct it's more controllable that

5846
01:57:51,629 --> 01:57:51,639
text correct it's more controllable that
 

5847
01:57:51,639 --> 01:57:53,870
text correct it's more controllable that
way yeah otherwise you can still end up

5848
01:57:53,870 --> 01:57:53,880
way yeah otherwise you can still end up
 

5849
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:56,629
way yeah otherwise you can still end up
saying nonsense or use the information

5850
01:57:56,629 --> 01:57:56,639
saying nonsense or use the information
 

5851
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:59,669
saying nonsense or use the information
in the documents and add some stuff of

5852
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
in the documents and add some stuff of
 

5853
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:03,310
in the documents and add some stuff of
your own right despite this these things

5854
01:58:03,310 --> 01:58:03,320
your own right despite this these things
 

5855
01:58:03,320 --> 01:58:04,589
your own right despite this these things
still happen I'm not saying it's

5856
01:58:04,589 --> 01:58:04,599
still happen I'm not saying it's
 

5857
01:58:04,599 --> 01:58:06,790
still happen I'm not saying it's
foolproof so where is there room for

5858
01:58:06,790 --> 01:58:06,800
foolproof so where is there room for
 

5859
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:09,310
foolproof so where is there room for
hallucination to seep in yeah there are

5860
01:58:09,310 --> 01:58:09,320
hallucination to seep in yeah there are
 

5861
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:12,149
hallucination to seep in yeah there are
multiple ways it can happen one is you

5862
01:58:12,149 --> 01:58:12,159
multiple ways it can happen one is you
 

5863
01:58:12,159 --> 01:58:13,950
multiple ways it can happen one is you
have all the information you need for

5864
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:13,960
have all the information you need for
 

5865
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:16,669
have all the information you need for
the query the model is just not smart

5866
01:58:16,669 --> 01:58:16,679
the query the model is just not smart
 

5867
01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:20,069
the query the model is just not smart
enough to understand the query at a

5868
01:58:20,069 --> 01:58:20,079
enough to understand the query at a
 

5869
01:58:20,079 --> 01:58:22,550
enough to understand the query at a
deeply semantic level and the paragraphs

5870
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:22,560
deeply semantic level and the paragraphs
 

5871
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,790
deeply semantic level and the paragraphs
at a deeply semantic level and only pick

5872
01:58:24,790 --> 01:58:24,800
at a deeply semantic level and only pick
 

5873
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:26,229
at a deeply semantic level and only pick
the relevant information and give you an

5874
01:58:26,229 --> 01:58:26,239
the relevant information and give you an
 

5875
01:58:26,239 --> 01:58:30,510
the relevant information and give you an
answer so that is a model skill issue

5876
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:30,520
answer so that is a model skill issue
 

5877
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,069
answer so that is a model skill issue
but that can be addressed as models get

5878
01:58:32,069 --> 01:58:32,079
but that can be addressed as models get
 

5879
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:34,589
but that can be addressed as models get
better and they have been getting better

5880
01:58:34,589 --> 01:58:34,599
better and they have been getting better
 

5881
01:58:34,599 --> 01:58:38,189
better and they have been getting better
now the other place where hallucinations

5882
01:58:38,189 --> 01:58:38,199
now the other place where hallucinations
 

5883
01:58:38,199 --> 01:58:43,790
now the other place where hallucinations
can happen is you have uh poor

5884
01:58:43,790 --> 01:58:43,800
can happen is you have uh poor
 

5885
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:46,069
can happen is you have uh poor
Snippets like your index is not good

5886
01:58:46,069 --> 01:58:46,079
Snippets like your index is not good
 

5887
01:58:46,079 --> 01:58:48,310
Snippets like your index is not good
enough oh yeah so you retrieve the right

5888
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:48,320
enough oh yeah so you retrieve the right
 

5889
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:51,109
enough oh yeah so you retrieve the right
documents or but but the information in

5890
01:58:51,109 --> 01:58:51,119
documents or but but the information in
 

5891
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:54,629
documents or but but the information in
them was not up to date M with stale or

5892
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:54,639
them was not up to date M with stale or
 

5893
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:56,950
them was not up to date M with stale or
or or not detailed enough and then the

5894
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:56,960
or or not detailed enough and then the
 

5895
01:58:56,960 --> 01:58:59,830
or or not detailed enough and then the
model had insufficient information or

5896
01:58:59,830 --> 01:58:59,840
model had insufficient information or
 

5897
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,510
model had insufficient information or
conflicting information from multiple

5898
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:01,520
conflicting information from multiple
 

5899
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,830
conflicting information from multiple
sources and ended up like getting

5900
01:59:03,830 --> 01:59:03,840
sources and ended up like getting
 

5901
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,270
sources and ended up like getting
confused and the third way it can happen

5902
01:59:06,270 --> 01:59:06,280
confused and the third way it can happen
 

5903
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:09,550
confused and the third way it can happen
is you added too much detail to the

5904
01:59:09,550 --> 01:59:09,560
is you added too much detail to the
 

5905
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:11,870
is you added too much detail to the
model like your index is so detailed

5906
01:59:11,870 --> 01:59:11,880
model like your index is so detailed
 

5907
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:14,510
model like your index is so detailed
your Snippets are so you use the full

5908
01:59:14,510 --> 01:59:14,520
your Snippets are so you use the full
 

5909
01:59:14,520 --> 01:59:15,550
your Snippets are so you use the full
version of the

5910
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:15,560
version of the
 

5911
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:18,189
version of the
page and you threw all of it at the

5912
01:59:18,189 --> 01:59:18,199
page and you threw all of it at the
 

5913
01:59:18,199 --> 01:59:19,990
page and you threw all of it at the
model and asked it to arrive at the

5914
01:59:19,990 --> 01:59:20,000
model and asked it to arrive at the
 

5915
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,069
model and asked it to arrive at the
answer and it's not able to discern

5916
01:59:22,069 --> 01:59:22,079
answer and it's not able to discern
 

5917
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:24,750
answer and it's not able to discern
learn clearly what is needed and throws

5918
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:24,760
learn clearly what is needed and throws
 

5919
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:26,229
learn clearly what is needed and throws
a lot of irrelevant stuff to it and that

5920
01:59:26,229 --> 01:59:26,239
a lot of irrelevant stuff to it and that
 

5921
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:28,390
a lot of irrelevant stuff to it and that
irrelevant stuff ended up confusing

5922
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:28,400
irrelevant stuff ended up confusing
 

5923
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:33,350
irrelevant stuff ended up confusing
it and made it like a bad answer so uh

5924
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:33,360
it and made it like a bad answer so uh
 

5925
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,189
it and made it like a bad answer so uh
all these three or the fourth way is

5926
01:59:35,189 --> 01:59:35,199
all these three or the fourth way is
 

5927
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:36,990
all these three or the fourth way is
like you uh end up retrieving completely

5928
01:59:36,990 --> 01:59:37,000
like you uh end up retrieving completely
 

5929
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,750
like you uh end up retrieving completely
irrelevant documents too but in such a

5930
01:59:39,750 --> 01:59:39,760
irrelevant documents too but in such a
 

5931
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:41,310
irrelevant documents too but in such a
case if a model is skillful enough it

5932
01:59:41,310 --> 01:59:41,320
case if a model is skillful enough it
 

5933
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:42,870
case if a model is skillful enough it
should just say I don't have enough

5934
01:59:42,870 --> 01:59:42,880
should just say I don't have enough
 

5935
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:45,550

5998
02:01:00,350 --> 02:01:00,360
enough you'll know that I specifically
 

5999
02:01:00,360 --> 02:01:02,350
enough you'll know that I specifically
said these are ways a model can go wrong

6000
02:01:02,350 --> 02:01:02,360
said these are ways a model can go wrong
 

6001
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:04,669
said these are ways a model can go wrong
and it'll use that and say well the

6002
02:01:04,669 --> 02:01:04,679
and it'll use that and say well the
 

6003
02:01:04,679 --> 02:01:07,069
and it'll use that and say well the
model doesn't know that there's video

6004
02:01:07,069 --> 02:01:07,079

editing so the indexing is fascinating

6006
02:01:09,709 --> 02:01:09,719
editing so the indexing is fascinating
 

6007
02:01:09,719 --> 02:01:11,310
editing so the indexing is fascinating
so is there something you could say

6008
02:01:11,310 --> 02:01:11,320
so is there something you could say
 

6009
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,030
so is there something you could say
about the some interesting aspects of

about the some interesting aspects of
 

6011
02:01:14,040 --> 02:01:16,350
about the some interesting aspects of
how the indexing is done yeah so

6012
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:16,360
how the indexing is done yeah so
 

6013
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:20,229
how the indexing is done yeah so
indexing is um you know multiple Parts

6014
02:01:20,229 --> 02:01:20,239
indexing is um you know multiple Parts
 

6015
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:22,790
indexing is um you know multiple Parts

the web Lots like even deciding like

6036
02:01:43,669 --> 02:01:43,679
the web Lots like even deciding like
 

6037
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:46,189
the web Lots like even deciding like
what to put in the queue Which Way Pages

6038
02:01:46,189 --> 02:01:46,199
what to put in the queue Which Way Pages
 

6039
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:49,350
what to put in the queue Which Way Pages
which domains and uh uh how frequently

6040
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:49,360
which domains and uh uh how frequently
 

6041
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:52,149
which domains and uh uh how frequently
all the domains need to get crawled and

6042
02:01:52,149 --> 02:01:52,159
all the domains need to get crawled and
 

6043
02:01:52,159 --> 02:01:54,069
all the domains need to get crawled and
um it's not just about like you know

6044
02:01:54,069 --> 02:01:54,079
um it's not just about like you know
 

6045
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:55,109
um it's not just about like you know
knowing which

6046
02:01:55,109 --> 02:01:55,119
knowing which
 

6047
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:57,270
knowing which
URLs it's just like you know deciding

6048
02:01:57,270 --> 02:01:57,280
URLs it's just like you know deciding
 

6049
02:01:57,280 --> 02:02:00,189
URLs it's just like you know deciding
what URLs to CW but um how you crawl

6050
02:02:00,189 --> 02:02:00,199
what URLs to CW but um how you crawl
 

6051
02:02:00,199 --> 02:02:02,390
what URLs to CW but um how you crawl
them you basically have to render

6052
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:02,400
them you basically have to render
 

6053
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:05,830
them you basically have to render
headless render and then websites are

6054
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:05,840
headless render and then websites are
 

6055
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,990
headless render and then websites are
more modern these days it's not just the

6056
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:08,000
more modern these days it's not just the
 

6057
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,430
more modern these days it's not just the
HTML um there's a lot of JavaScript

6058
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:10,440
HTML um there's a lot of JavaScript
 

6059
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:13,149
HTML um there's a lot of JavaScript
rendering uh you have to decide like

6060
02:02:13,149 --> 02:02:13,159
rendering uh you have to decide like
 

6061
02:02:13,159 --> 02:02:14,589
rendering uh you have to decide like
what's what's the real thing you want

6062
02:02:14,589 --> 02:02:14,599
what's what's the real thing you want
 

6063
02:02:14,599 --> 02:02:17,950
what's what's the real thing you want
from a page and obviously uh people have

6064
02:02:17,950 --> 02:02:17,960
from a page and obviously uh people have
 

6065
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:21,109
from a page and obviously uh people have
robots to text file uh and that's like a

6066
02:02:21,109 --> 02:02:21,119
robots to text file uh and that's like a
 

6067
02:02:21,119 --> 02:02:23,109
robots to text file uh and that's like a
politeness policy where you you should

6068
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:23,119
politeness policy where you you should
 

6069
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:25,709
politeness policy where you you should
respect the delay time so that you don't

6070
02:02:25,709 --> 02:02:25,719
respect the delay time so that you don't
 

6071
02:02:25,719 --> 02:02:27,229
respect the delay time so that you don't
like overload their servers by

6072
02:02:27,229 --> 02:02:27,239
like overload their servers by
 

6073
02:02:27,239 --> 02:02:29,069
like overload their servers by
continually crawling them and then

6074
02:02:29,069 --> 02:02:29,079
continually crawling them and then
 

6075
02:02:29,079 --> 02:02:31,069
continually crawling them and then
there's like stuff that they say is not

6076
02:02:31,069 --> 02:02:31,079
there's like stuff that they say is not
 

6077
02:02:31,079 --> 02:02:32,430
there's like stuff that they say is not
supposed to be crawled and stuff that

6078
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:32,440
supposed to be crawled and stuff that
 

6079
02:02:32,440 --> 02:02:34,669
supposed to be crawled and stuff that
they allowed to be craw and you have to

6080
02:02:34,669 --> 02:02:34,679
they allowed to be craw and you have to
 

6081
02:02:34,679 --> 02:02:37,950
they allowed to be craw and you have to
respect that and uh the bot needs to be

6082
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:37,960
respect that and uh the bot needs to be
 

6083
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:40,550
respect that and uh the bot needs to be
aware of all these things and

6084
02:02:40,550 --> 02:02:40,560
aware of all these things and
 

6085
02:02:40,560 --> 02:02:42,990
aware of all these things and
appropriately craw stuff but most most

6086
02:02:42,990 --> 02:02:43,000
appropriately craw stuff but most most
 

6087
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,550
appropriately craw stuff but most most

that and U um you need to

6102
02:03:00,229 --> 02:03:00,239
that and U um you need to
 

6103
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:02,790
that and U um you need to
like keep track of all these things per

6104
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:02,800
like keep track of all these things per
 

6105
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,990
like keep track of all these things per
domains and subdomains and it's crazy

6107
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,030

and then you also need to decide the
 

6109
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:09,310

6111
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:12,310

6205
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:02,149
part by the way there's a indexing part
assuming you have like a post-process

02:05:02,149 --> 02:05:02,159
assuming you have like a post-process
 

6207
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:04,709
assuming you have like a post-process
version per URL and then there's a

6208
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:04,719
version per URL and then there's a
 

6209
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:07,669
version per URL and then there's a
ranking part that uh depending on the

02:05:07,669 --> 02:05:07,679
ranking part that uh depending on the
 

6211
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:10,990
ranking part that uh depending on the
query you ask FES the relevant documents

6212
02:05:10,990 --> 02:05:11,000
query you ask FES the relevant documents
 

6213
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,030
query you ask FES the relevant documents
from the

02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:12,040
from the
 

6215
02:05:12,040 --> 02:05:15,470
from the
index and some kind of score and that's

6216
02:05:15,470 --> 02:05:15,480
index and some kind of score and that's
 

6217
02:05:15,480 --> 02:05:17,629
index and some kind of score and that's
where like when you have like billions

6218
02:05:17,629 --> 02:05:17,639
where like when you have like billions
 

6219
02:05:17,639 --> 02:05:19,510
where like when you have like billions
of pages in your index and you only want

6220
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:19,520
of pages in your index and you only want
 

6221
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:21,750
of pages in your index and you only want
the top K you have to rely on

6222
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:21,760
the top K you have to rely on
 

6223
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,669
the top K you have to rely on
approximate algorithms to get you the

6224
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:23,679
approximate algorithms to get you the
 

6225
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:26,310
approximate algorithms to get you the
top K so that's that's the ranking but

6226
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:26,320
top K so that's that's the ranking but
 

6227
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:29,790
top K so that's that's the ranking but
you also I mean that step of converting

6228
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:29,800
you also I mean that step of converting
 

6229
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:32,549
you also I mean that step of converting
a page into something that could be

02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:05,760
information retrieval system that just
 

6257
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,189
information retrieval system that just
works actually really well even today uh

6258
02:06:09,189 --> 02:06:09,199
works actually really well even today uh
 

6259
02:06:09,199 --> 02:06:13,030
works actually really well even today uh
and uh bm25 is a more uh sophisticated

6260
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:13,040
and uh bm25 is a more uh sophisticated
 

6261
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:15,310

beating most embeddings on ranking wow

6264
02:06:18,149 --> 02:06:18,159
beating most embeddings on ranking wow
 

6265
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:19,870
beating most embeddings on ranking wow
like when openi released their

6266
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:19,880
like when openi released their
 

6267
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:22,109
like when openi released their
embeddings there was some rovery around

6268
02:06:22,109 --> 02:06:22,119
embeddings there was some rovery around
 

6269
02:06:22,119 --> 02:06:24,030
embeddings there was some rovery around
it because it wasn't even beating bm25

6270
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:24,040
it because it wasn't even beating bm25
 

6271
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:27,030
it because it wasn't even beating bm25
on many many retrievable benchmarks not

6272
02:06:27,030 --> 02:06:27,040
on many many retrievable benchmarks not
 

6273
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:28,910
on many many retrievable benchmarks not
because they didn't do a good job bm25

6274
02:06:28,910 --> 02:06:28,920
because they didn't do a good job bm25
 

6275
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:32,549
because they didn't do a good job bm25
is so good so this is why like just pure

6276
02:06:32,549 --> 02:06:32,559
is so good so this is why like just pure
 

6277
02:06:32,559 --> 02:06:34,350
is so good so this is why like just pure
embeddings and Vector spaces are not

6278
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:34,360

going to solve the search problem you

6280
02:06:35,709 --> 02:06:35,719
going to solve the search problem you
 

6281
02:06:35,719 --> 02:06:36,709
going to solve the search problem you
need the

6282
02:06:36,709 --> 02:06:36,719
need the
 

6283
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:40,030
need the
traditional uh term based retrieval you

6284
02:06:40,030 --> 02:06:40,040
traditional uh term based retrieval you
 

6285
02:06:40,040 --> 02:06:42,270
traditional uh term based retrieval you
need some kind of engram based retrieval

6286
02:06:42,270 --> 02:06:42,280
need some kind of engram based retrieval
 

6287
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:44,189
need some kind of engram based retrieval
so for the for the

6288
02:06:44,189 --> 02:06:44,199
so for the for the
 

6289
02:06:44,199 --> 02:06:48,270
so for the for the
unrestricted web data you can't just uh

6290
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:48,280
unrestricted web data you can't just uh
 

6291
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:50,790
unrestricted web data you can't just uh
you need a combination of all a hybrid

6292
02:06:50,790 --> 02:06:50,800
you need a combination of all a hybrid
 

6293
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,910
you need a combination of all a hybrid
yeah and you also need other ranking

6294
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:52,920
yeah and you also need other ranking
 

6295
02:06:52,920 --> 02:06:55,669
yeah and you also need other ranking
signals outside of the semantic or

6296
02:06:55,669 --> 02:06:55,679
signals outside of the semantic or
 

6297
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:57,870
signals outside of the semantic or
word-based this is like page ranks like

6298
02:06:57,870 --> 02:06:57,880
word-based this is like page ranks like
 

6299
02:06:57,880 --> 02:07:01,830
word-based this is like page ranks like
signals that score domain Authority and

6300
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:01,840
signals that score domain Authority and
 

6301
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:02,950
signals that score domain Authority and
uh

6302
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:02,960
uh
 

6303
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,549
uh
recency right so you have to put some

6304
02:07:05,549 --> 02:07:05,559
recency right so you have to put some
 

6305
02:07:05,559 --> 02:07:08,750
recency right so you have to put some
extra positive weight on the res but not

6306
02:07:08,750 --> 02:07:08,760
extra positive weight on the res but not
 

6307
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:10,669
extra positive weight on the res but not
so it overwhelms and this really depends

6308
02:07:10,669 --> 02:07:10,679
so it overwhelms and this really depends
 

6309
02:07:10,679 --> 02:07:12,870
so it overwhelms and this really depends
on the query category and that's why

6310
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:12,880
on the query category and that's why
 

6311
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,069
on the query category and that's why
search is a hard lot of domain knowledge

6312
02:07:15,069 --> 02:07:15,079
search is a hard lot of domain knowledge
 

6313
02:07:15,079 --> 02:07:17,069
search is a hard lot of domain knowledge
invol problem yeah that's why we chose

6314
02:07:17,069 --> 02:07:17,079
invol problem yeah that's why we chose
 

6315
02:07:17,079 --> 02:07:18,589
invol problem yeah that's why we chose
to work on like everybody talks about

6316
02:07:18,589 --> 02:07:18,599
to work on like everybody talks about
 

6317
02:07:18,599 --> 02:07:22,709

amount of domain knowledge you need to

6320
02:07:24,990 --> 02:07:25,000
amount of domain knowledge you need to
 

6321
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,830
amount of domain knowledge you need to
work on this and it takes a lot of time

6322
02:07:27,830 --> 02:07:27,840
work on this and it takes a lot of time
 

6323
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,390
work on this and it takes a lot of time
to build up towards like uh

6324
02:07:31,390 --> 02:07:31,400
to build up towards like uh
 

6325
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:33,390
to build up towards like uh
highly really good

6326
02:07:33,390 --> 02:07:33,400
highly really good
 

6327
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:36,270
highly really good
index with like really good ranking and

6328
02:07:36,270 --> 02:07:36,280
index with like really good ranking and
 

6329
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:38,750
index with like really good ranking and
all these signals so how much of search

6330
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:38,760
all these signals so how much of search
 

6331
02:07:38,760 --> 02:07:42,149
all these signals so how much of search
is a science how much of it is an art I

6332
02:07:42,149 --> 02:07:42,159
is a science how much of it is an art I
 

6333
02:07:42,159 --> 02:07:45,430
is a science how much of it is an art I
would say it's a good amount of

would say it's a good amount of
 

6335
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:48,189
would say it's a good amount of
science but a lot of user Centric

6336
02:07:48,189 --> 02:07:48,199
science but a lot of user Centric

02:07:50,629 --> 02:07:50,639
thinking baked into it so constantly you
 

6339
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:51,990
thinking baked into it so constantly you
come up with an issue

6340
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,000
come up with an issue
 

6341
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,709

was a particular set of documents and a
 

6343
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:56,510
was a particular set of documents and a
particular kinds of questions that users

02:07:56,520 --> 02:07:59,189
particular kinds of questions that users
ask and the system perplexity doesn't

02:07:59,189 --> 02:07:59,199
ask and the system perplexity doesn't
 

6347
02:07:59,199 --> 02:08:01,629
ask and the system perplexity doesn't
work well for that and you're like okay

6348
02:08:01,629 --> 02:08:01,639
work well for that and you're like okay
 

6349
02:08:01,639 --> 02:08:04,510
work well for that and you're like okay
how can we make it work well for that we

6350
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:04,520
how can we make it work well for that we
 

6351
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:07,709
how can we make it work well for that we
but but not in a per query basis right

like you keep improving with every yeah
we not taking off the shelf models from

6556
02:12:33,830 --> 02:12:33,840
we not taking off the shelf models from
 

6557
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:36,990
we not taking off the shelf models from
anybody we have customized it for the

6558
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:37,000
anybody we have customized it for the
 

6559
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,390
anybody we have customized it for the
product uh whether like we own the

6560
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:39,400
product uh whether like we own the
 

6561
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:41,750
product uh whether like we own the
weights for it or not is something else

6562
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
weights for it or not is something else
 

6563
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:43,910
weights for it or not is something else
right so

6564
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:43,920
right so
 

6565
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:46,910
right so
the I think I think there's also power

6566
02:12:46,910 --> 02:12:46,920
the I think I think there's also power
 

6567
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:49,310
the I think I think there's also power
to design the product to work well with

6568
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:49,320
to design the product to work well with
 

6569
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,430
to design the product to work well with
any model if there are some

6570
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:51,440
any model if there are some
 

6571
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:53,350
any model if there are some
idiosyncrasies of any model shouldn't

6572
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:53,360
idiosyncrasies of any model shouldn't
 

6573
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:55,870
idiosyncrasies of any model shouldn't
affect the product so it's really

6574
02:12:55,870 --> 02:12:55,880
affect the product so it's really
 

6575
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:57,510
affect the product so it's really
responsive how do you get the latency to

6576
02:12:57,510 --> 02:12:57,520
responsive how do you get the latency to
 

6577
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:01,030
responsive how do you get the latency to
be so low and how do you make it even

6578
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:01,040
be so low and how do you make it even
 

6579
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:03,430
be so low and how do you make it even
lower we

6580
02:13:03,430 --> 02:13:03,440
lower we
 

6581
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:06,310
lower we
um took inspiration from Google there's

6582
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:06,320
um took inspiration from Google there's
 

6583
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:08,229
um took inspiration from Google there's
this whole concept called tail

6584
02:13:08,229 --> 02:13:08,239
this whole concept called tail
 

6585
02:13:08,239 --> 02:13:11,310
this whole concept called tail
latency uh it's a paper by Jeff Dean and

6586
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:11,320
latency uh it's a paper by Jeff Dean and
 

6587
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:15,350
latency uh it's a paper by Jeff Dean and
um another person where it's not enough

6588
02:13:15,350 --> 02:13:15,360
um another person where it's not enough
 

6589
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:17,750
um another person where it's not enough
for you to just test a few queries see

6590
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:17,760
for you to just test a few queries see
 

6591
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:19,549
for you to just test a few queries see
if there fast and conclude that your

6592
02:13:19,549 --> 02:13:19,559
if there fast and conclude that your
 

6593
02:13:19,559 --> 02:13:21,910
if there fast and conclude that your
prod product is fast

6594
02:13:21,910 --> 02:13:21,920
prod product is fast
 

6595
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:24,069
prod product is fast
it's very important for you to track the

6596
02:13:24,069 --> 02:13:24,079
it's very important for you to track the
 

6597
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:26,990
it's very important for you to track the
P90 and P99

6598
02:13:26,990 --> 02:13:27,000
P90 and P99
 

6599
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,430
P90 and P99
latencies uh which is like the 90th to

6600
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:29,440
latencies uh which is like the 90th to
 

6601
02:13:29,440 --> 02:13:30,510
latencies uh which is like the 90th to
99th

6602
02:13:30,510 --> 02:13:30,520
99th
 

6603
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:33,629
99th
percentile because if a system fails 10%

6604
02:13:33,629 --> 02:13:33,639
percentile because if a system fails 10%
 

6605
02:13:33,639 --> 02:13:35,750
percentile because if a system fails 10%
of the times and you have a lot of

6606
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:35,760
of the times and you have a lot of
 

6607
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:38,950
of the times and you have a lot of
servers uh you could have like certain

6608
02:13:38,950 --> 02:13:38,960
servers uh you could have like certain
 

6609
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:42,149
servers uh you could have like certain
queries that are at the tail failing

6610
02:13:42,149 --> 02:13:42,159
queries that are at the tail failing
 

6611
02:13:42,159 --> 02:13:45,549
queries that are at the tail failing
more often without you even realizing it

6612
02:13:45,549 --> 02:13:45,559
more often without you even realizing it
 

6613
02:13:45,559 --> 02:13:47,069
more often without you even realizing it
and that could frustrate some users

6614
02:13:47,069 --> 02:13:47,079
and that could frustrate some users
 

6615
02:13:47,079 --> 02:13:48,350
and that could frustrate some users
especially at a time when you have a lot

6616
02:13:48,350 --> 02:13:48,360
especially at a time when you have a lot
 

6617
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:51,910
especially at a time when you have a lot
of queries uh suddenly a spike

6618
02:13:51,910 --> 02:13:51,920
of queries uh suddenly a spike
 

6619
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:53,430
of queries uh suddenly a spike
right so it's very important for you to

6620
02:13:53,430 --> 02:13:53,440
right so it's very important for you to
 

6621
02:13:53,440 --> 02:13:56,149
right so it's very important for you to
track the tail latency and we track it

6622
02:13:56,149 --> 02:13:56,159
track the tail latency and we track it
 

6623
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:58,390
track the tail latency and we track it
at every single component of our system

6624
02:13:58,390 --> 02:13:58,400
at every single component of our system
 

6625
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:01,549
at every single component of our system
mhm be the search layer or the llm layer

6627
02:14:01,559 --> 02:14:03,430
mhm be the search layer or the llm layer
in the llm the most important thing is

6628
02:14:03,430 --> 02:14:03,440
in the llm the most important thing is
 

6629
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:05,270
in the llm the most important thing is
the throughput and the time to First

6630
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:05,280
the throughput and the time to First
 

6631
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:08,629
the throughput and the time to First
token we usually is refer to as ttft

6632
02:14:08,629 --> 02:14:08,639

time to First token and the throughput

6634
02:14:11,189 --> 02:14:11,199
time to First token and the throughput
 

6635
02:14:11,199 --> 02:14:13,069
time to First token and the throughput
which is decides how fast you can stream

6636
02:14:13,069 --> 02:14:13,079
which is decides how fast you can stream
 

6637
02:14:13,079 --> 02:14:15,910
which is decides how fast you can stream
things both are really important and of

02:14:15,910 --> 02:14:15,920
things both are really important and of
 

6639
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:17,589

in terms of serving like open anthropic

6642
02:14:20,750 --> 02:14:20,760
in terms of serving like open anthropic
 

6643
02:14:20,760 --> 02:14:22,790
in terms of serving like open anthropic
uh it's it's you know we are reliant on

6644
02:14:22,790 --> 02:14:22,800
uh it's it's you know we are reliant on
 

6645
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:25,069
uh it's it's you know we are reliant on
them to do to build a good

02:14:25,069 --> 02:14:25,079
them to do to build a good
 

6647
02:14:25,079 --> 02:14:28,069
them to do to build a good
infrastructure and they are incentivized

6648
02:14:28,069 --> 02:14:28,079
infrastructure and they are incentivized
 

6649
02:14:28,079 --> 02:14:29,709

CEO startup perspective yeah I mean you
 

6701
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,549
CEO startup perspective yeah I mean you
got to make decisions like should I go

6702
02:15:27,549 --> 02:15:27,559
got to make decisions like should I go
 

6703
02:15:27,559 --> 02:15:29,750
got to make decisions like should I go
spend like 10 million or 20 million more

6704
02:15:29,750 --> 02:15:29,760
spend like 10 million or 20 million more
 

6705
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:32,950
spend like 10 million or 20 million more
and buy more gpus or should I go and pay

6706
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:32,960
and buy more gpus or should I go and pay
 

6707

6820
02:17:47,750 --> 02:17:47,760
data centers now I think you know he he
 

6821
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:49,469
data centers now I think you know he he
has this mentality that it all has to be

6822
02:17:49,469 --> 02:17:49,479
has this mentality that it all has to be
 

6823
02:17:49,479 --> 02:17:52,270
has this mentality that it all has to be
in house yeah but it it it frees you

6824
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:52,280
in house yeah but it it it frees you
 

6825
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:53,709
in house yeah but it it it frees you
from working on problems that you don't

6826
02:17:53,709 --> 02:17:53,719
from working on problems that you don't
 

6827

from working on problems that you don't
need to be working on when you're like

scaling up your startup also AWS

6830
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:57,920
scaling up your startup also AWS
 

6831
02:17:57,920 --> 02:18:00,429
scaling up your startup also AWS
infrastructure is

6832
02:18:00,429 --> 02:18:00,439
infrastructure is
 

6833
02:18:00,439 --> 02:18:03,150
infrastructure is
amazing like it's not just amazing in

6834
02:18:03,150 --> 02:18:03,160
amazing like it's not just amazing in
 

6835
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:06,270
amazing like it's not just amazing in
terms of its quality uh it also helps

6836
02:18:06,270 --> 02:18:06,280
terms of its quality uh it also helps
 

6837
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:09,070
terms of its quality uh it also helps
you to recruit Engineers like easily

6838
02:18:09,070 --> 02:18:09,080
you to recruit Engineers like easily
 

6839
02:18:09,080 --> 02:18:11,230
you to recruit Engineers like easily
because if you're on AWS and all

6840
02:18:11,230 --> 02:18:11,240
because if you're on AWS and all
 

6841
02:18:11,240 --> 02:18:13,790
because if you're on AWS and all
Engineers are already trained using

6842
02:18:13,790 --> 02:18:13,800
Engineers are already trained using
 

6843
02:18:13,800 --> 02:18:16,589
Engineers are already trained using
AWS so the speed I which they can ramp

6844
02:18:16,589 --> 02:18:16,599
AWS so the speed I which they can ramp
 

6845
02:18:16,599 --> 02:18:19,389
AWS so the speed I which they can ramp
up is amazing so uh does perplexity use

6846
02:18:19,389 --> 02:18:19,399
up is amazing so uh does perplexity use
 

6847
02:18:19,399 --> 02:18:21,349
up is amazing so uh does perplexity use
AWS yeah

6848
02:18:21,349 --> 02:18:21,359
AWS yeah
 

6849
02:18:21,359 --> 02:18:24,230
AWS yeah
and so you have to figure out how much

6850
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:24,240
and so you have to figure out how much
 

6851
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:26,389
and so you have to figure out how much
how much more instances to buy those

6852
02:18:26,389 --> 02:18:26,399
how much more instances to buy those
 

6853
02:18:26,399 --> 02:18:27,830
how much more instances to buy those
kinds of things you have that's the kind

6854
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:27,840
kinds of things you have that's the kind
 

6855
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:29,870
kinds of things you have that's the kind
of problems you need to solve like more

6856
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:29,880
of problems you need to solve like more
 

6857
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:31,549
of problems you need to solve like more
in like whether whether you want to like

6858
02:18:31,549 --> 02:18:31,559
in like whether whether you want to like
 

6859
02:18:31,559 --> 02:18:34,270
in like whether whether you want to like
keep look look lot there's you know it's

6860
02:18:34,270 --> 02:18:34,280
keep look look lot there's you know it's
 

6861
02:18:34,280 --> 02:18:35,870
keep look look lot there's you know it's
a whole reason it's called elastic some

6862
02:18:35,870 --> 02:18:35,880
a whole reason it's called elastic some
 

6863
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:37,150
a whole reason it's called elastic some
of these things can be scale very

6864
02:18:37,150 --> 02:18:37,160
of these things can be scale very
 

6865
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:39,750
of these things can be scale very
gracefully but other things so much not

6866
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:39,760
gracefully but other things so much not
 

6867
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:42,230
gracefully but other things so much not
like gpus or models like you need to

6868
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:42,240
like gpus or models like you need to
 

6869
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:44,589
like gpus or models like you need to
still like make decisions on a discrete

6870
02:18:44,589 --> 02:18:44,599
still like make decisions on a discrete
 

6871
02:18:44,599 --> 02:18:47,469
still like make decisions on a discrete
basis you tweeted a poll asking who's

6872
02:18:47,469 --> 02:18:47,479
basis you tweeted a poll asking who's
 

6873
02:18:47,479 --> 02:18:50,270
basis you tweeted a poll asking who's
likely to build the first 1 million h100

6874
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:50,280
likely to build the first 1 million h100
 

6875
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,870
likely to build the first 1 million h100
GPU equivalent data center uh and

6876
02:18:52,870 --> 02:18:52,880
GPU equivalent data center uh and
 

6877
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:55,150
GPU equivalent data center uh and
there's a bunch of options there so uh

6878
02:18:55,150 --> 02:18:55,160
there's a bunch of options there so uh
 

6879
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:56,549
there's a bunch of options there so uh
what's your bet on who do you think will

6880
02:18:56,549 --> 02:18:56,559
what's your bet on who do you think will
 

6881
02:18:56,559 --> 02:19:00,309
what's your bet on who do you think will
do it like Google meta xai by the way I

6882
02:19:00,309 --> 02:19:00,319
do it like Google meta xai by the way I
 

6883
02:19:00,319 --> 02:19:01,669
do it like Google meta xai by the way I
want to point out like a lot of people

6884
02:19:01,669 --> 02:19:01,679
want to point out like a lot of people
 

6885
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:03,790
want to point out like a lot of people
said uh it's not just open aai it's

6886
02:19:03,790 --> 02:19:03,800
said uh it's not just open aai it's
 

6887
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:06,469
said uh it's not just open aai it's
Microsoft and that's a fair Counterpoint

6888
02:19:06,469 --> 02:19:06,479
Microsoft and that's a fair Counterpoint
 

6889
02:19:06,479 --> 02:19:07,830
Microsoft and that's a fair Counterpoint
to that like what was the option you

6890
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:07,840
to that like what was the option you
 

6891
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,509
to that like what was the option you
provide open a or I think it was like

6892
02:19:09,509 --> 02:19:09,519
provide open a or I think it was like
 

6893
02:19:09,519 --> 02:19:13,790
provide open a or I think it was like
Google open AI meta X obviously open a

6894
02:19:13,790 --> 02:19:13,800
Google open AI meta X obviously open a
 

6895
02:19:13,800 --> 02:19:16,469
Google open AI meta X obviously open a
is not just open AI it's Microsoft 2o

6896
02:19:16,469 --> 02:19:16,479
is not just open AI it's Microsoft 2o
 

6897
02:19:16,479 --> 02:19:19,389
is not just open AI it's Microsoft 2o
right and um Twitter doesn't let you do

6898
02:19:19,389 --> 02:19:19,399
right and um Twitter doesn't let you do
 

6899
02:19:19,399 --> 02:19:23,469
right and um Twitter doesn't let you do
polls with more than four options so

6900
02:19:23,469 --> 02:19:23,479
polls with more than four options so
 

6901
02:19:23,479 --> 02:19:25,030
polls with more than four options so
ideally you should have added anthropic

6902
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:25,040
ideally you should have added anthropic
 

6903
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,790
ideally you should have added anthropic
or Amazon to in the mix million is just

6904
02:19:27,790 --> 02:19:27,800
or Amazon to in the mix million is just
 

6905
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:30,110
or Amazon to in the mix million is just
a cool number like yeah and Elon

6906
02:19:30,110 --> 02:19:30,120
a cool number like yeah and Elon
 

6907
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:33,389
a cool number like yeah and Elon
announced some insane yeah Elon said

6908
02:19:33,389 --> 02:19:33,399
announced some insane yeah Elon said
 

6909
02:19:33,399 --> 02:19:35,549
announced some insane yeah Elon said
like it's not just about the core

6910
02:19:35,549 --> 02:19:35,559
like it's not just about the core
 

6911
02:19:35,559 --> 02:19:38,589
like it's not just about the core
gigawatt I mean he the point I clearly

6912
02:19:38,589 --> 02:19:38,599
gigawatt I mean he the point I clearly
 

6913
02:19:38,599 --> 02:19:40,870
gigawatt I mean he the point I clearly
made in the poll was equivalent so it

6914
02:19:40,870 --> 02:19:40,880
made in the poll was equivalent so it
 

6915
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:42,709
made in the poll was equivalent so it
doesn't have to be literally million H

6916
02:19:42,709 --> 02:19:42,719
doesn't have to be literally million H
 

6917
02:19:42,719 --> 02:19:45,750
doesn't have to be literally million H
wonders but it could be fewer gpus of

6918
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:45,760
wonders but it could be fewer gpus of
 

6919
02:19:45,760 --> 02:19:48,110
wonders but it could be fewer gpus of
the Next Generation that match the

6920
02:19:48,110 --> 02:19:48,120
the Next Generation that match the
 

6921
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:50,910
the Next Generation that match the
capabilities of the million H 100s at

6922
02:19:50,910 --> 02:19:50,920
capabilities of the million H 100s at
 

6923
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:54,469
capabilities of the million H 100s at
lower power consumption great um whether

6924
02:19:54,469 --> 02:19:54,479
lower power consumption great um whether
 

6925
02:19:54,479 --> 02:19:57,349
lower power consumption great um whether
it be one gwatt or 10 gwatt I don't know

6926
02:19:57,349 --> 02:19:57,359
it be one gwatt or 10 gwatt I don't know
 

6927
02:19:57,359 --> 02:20:03,030
it be one gwatt or 10 gwatt I don't know
right so it's a lot of power energy

6928
02:20:03,030 --> 02:20:03,040

 

6929
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:05,349

and I think like you know the kind of

6930
02:20:05,349 --> 02:20:05,359
and I think like you know the kind of
 

6931
02:20:05,359 --> 02:20:07,710
and I think like you know the kind of
things we talked about on the inference

6932
02:20:07,710 --> 02:20:07,720
things we talked about on the inference
 

6933
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:11,230
things we talked about on the inference
compute being very essential for future

6934
02:20:11,230 --> 02:20:11,240
compute being very essential for future
 

6935
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:13,190
compute being very essential for future
like highly capable AI systems or even

6936
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,200
like highly capable AI systems or even
 

6937
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:16,110
like highly capable AI systems or even
to explore all these research directions

6938
02:20:16,110 --> 02:20:16,120
to explore all these research directions
 

6939
02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:18,349
to explore all these research directions
like model bootstrapping of their own

6940
02:20:18,349 --> 02:20:18,359
like model bootstrapping of their own
 

6941
02:20:18,359 --> 02:20:20,910
like model bootstrapping of their own
reasoning doing their own inference you

6942
02:20:20,910 --> 02:20:20,920
reasoning doing their own inference you
 

6943
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:24,070
reasoning doing their own inference you
need a lot of gpus how much about

6944
02:20:24,070 --> 02:20:24,080
need a lot of gpus how much about
 

6945
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:27,230
need a lot of gpus how much about
winning in the George Hots way hashtag

6946
02:20:27,230 --> 02:20:27,240
winning in the George Hots way hashtag
 

6947
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:29,630
winning in the George Hots way hashtag
winning is about the compute who gets

6948
02:20:29,630 --> 02:20:29,640
winning is about the compute who gets
 

6949
02:20:29,640 --> 02:20:31,349
winning is about the compute who gets
the biggest

02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:33,710
the biggest
compute right now it seems like that's

6952
02:20:33,710 --> 02:20:33,720
compute right now it seems like that's
 

6953
02:20:33,720 --> 02:20:35,190

that uh if you can decouple reasoning

6962
02:20:48,830 --> 02:20:48,840
that uh if you can decouple reasoning
 

6963
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:51,670
that uh if you can decouple reasoning
and facts and end up up with much

6964
02:20:51,670 --> 02:20:51,680
and facts and end up up with much
 

6965
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,670
and facts and end up up with much
smaller models that can reason really

6966
02:20:53,670 --> 02:20:53,680
smaller models that can reason really
 

6967
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:56,670
smaller models that can reason really
well you don't need a

6968
02:20:56,670 --> 02:20:56,680
well you don't need a
 

6969
02:20:56,680 --> 02:20:59,910
well you don't need a
million um h100 equ and

6973
02:21:02,319 --> 02:21:04,830

decoupling reasoning and facts yeah how

6974
02:21:04,830 --> 02:21:04,840
decoupling reasoning and facts yeah how
 

6975
02:21:04,840 --> 02:21:06,270
decoupling reasoning and facts yeah how
do you represent knowledge in a much

6976
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:06,280
do you represent knowledge in a much
 

6977
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:09,870
do you represent knowledge in a much
more efficient abstract

6978
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:09,880
more efficient abstract
 

6979
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:13,870
more efficient abstract
way and make reasoning more a thing that

6980
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:13,880
way and make reasoning more a thing that
 

6981
02:21:13,880 --> 02:21:17,349
way and make reasoning more a thing that
is iterative and parameter decoupled so

6982
02:21:17,349 --> 02:21:17,359
is iterative and parameter decoupled so
 

6983
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:19,389
is iterative and parameter decoupled so
what from your whole experience what

6984
02:21:19,389 --> 02:21:19,399
what from your whole experience what
 

6985
02:21:19,399 --> 02:21:21,110
what from your whole experience what
advice would you give to people

6986
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:21,120
advice would you give to people
 

6987
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:23,950
advice would you give to people
looking to start a company about how to

6988
02:21:23,950 --> 02:21:23,960
looking to start a company about how to
 

6989
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:27,950
looking to start a company about how to
how to do so what startup advice do you

6990
02:21:27,950 --> 02:21:27,960
how to do so what startup advice do you
 

6991
02:21:27,960 --> 02:21:30,550
how to do so what startup advice do you
have I think like you know all the

6992
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:30,560
have I think like you know all the
 

6993
02:21:30,560 --> 02:21:33,950
have I think like you know all the
traditional wisdom applies like I'm not

6994
02:21:33,950 --> 02:21:33,960
traditional wisdom applies like I'm not
 

6995
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:37,550
traditional wisdom applies like I'm not
going to say none of that matters like

6996
02:21:37,550 --> 02:21:37,560
going to say none of that matters like
 

6997
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:41,870
going to say none of that matters like
Relentless determination

6998
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:41,880

 

6999
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:44,590

grit believing in yourself and others

7000
02:21:44,590 --> 02:21:44,600
grit believing in yourself and others
 

7001
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:46,469
grit believing in yourself and others
don't all these things matter so if you

7002
02:21:46,469 --> 02:21:46,479
don't all these things matter so if you
 

7003
02:21:46,479 --> 02:21:48,750
don't all these things matter so if you
don't have these traits I think it's

7004
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:48,760
don't have these traits I think it's
 

7005
02:21:48,760 --> 02:21:51,110
don't have these traits I think it's
definitely hard to do a company

7006
02:21:51,110 --> 02:21:51,120
definitely hard to do a company
 

7007
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,990
definitely hard to do a company
but you deciding to do a company despite

7008
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:54,000
but you deciding to do a company despite
 

7009
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,990
but you deciding to do a company despite
all this clearly means you have it or

7010
02:21:55,990 --> 02:21:56,000
all this clearly means you have it or
 

7011
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:57,710
all this clearly means you have it or
you think you have it either way you can

7012
02:21:57,710 --> 02:21:57,720
you think you have it either way you can
 

7013
02:21:57,720 --> 02:21:59,870
you think you have it either way you can
fake it till you have it I think the

7014
02:21:59,870 --> 02:21:59,880
fake it till you have it I think the
 

7015
02:21:59,880 --> 02:22:01,750
fake it till you have it I think the
thing that most people get wrong after

7016
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:01,760
thing that most people get wrong after
 

7017
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:05,670
thing that most people get wrong after
they've decided to start a company is um

7018
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:05,680
they've decided to start a company is um
 

7019
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:08,590
they've decided to start a company is um
work on things they think the market

7020
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:08,600
work on things they think the market

optimizing with a discount Factor that's

7468
02:31:30,510 --> 02:31:30,520
optimizing with a discount Factor that's
 

7469
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:33,950
optimizing with a discount Factor that's
like equal to one or not like discount

7470
02:31:33,950 --> 02:31:33,960
like equal to one or not like discount
 

7471
02:31:33,960 --> 02:31:36,309
like equal to one or not like discount
Factor that's close to zero yeah I think

7472
02:31:36,309 --> 02:31:36,319
Factor that's close to zero yeah I think
 

7473
02:31:36,319 --> 02:31:37,990
Factor that's close to zero yeah I think
you have to uh surround yourself by

which is basically from the free base
 

7643
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:10,269
which is basically from the free base
and Wiki data stuff so it was clear that

7644
02:35:10,269 --> 02:35:10,279
and Wiki data stuff so it was clear that
 

7645
02:35:10,279 --> 02:35:12,150
and Wiki data stuff so it was clear that
like at least 30 to 40% of search

7646
02:35:12,150 --> 02:35:12,160
like at least 30 to 40% of search
 

7647
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:14,429
like at least 30 to 40% of search
traffic is just answers right and even

the rest you can say deeper answers like
 

7651
02:35:16,760 --> 02:35:19,389
the rest you can say deeper answers like
what we're serving right now but what is

02:35:39,110 --> 02:35:39,120
like clearly explain him the difference
 

7669
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:42,110
like clearly explain him the difference
between uh search and answer engines MH

7670
02:35:42,110 --> 02:35:42,120
between uh search and answer engines MH
 

7671
02:35:42,120 --> 02:35:43,870
between uh search and answer engines MH
uh and and so that's going to let you

7672
02:35:43,870 --> 02:35:43,880
uh and and so that's going to let you
 

7673
02:35:43,880 --> 02:35:46,630
uh and and so that's going to let you
ask a new kind of question new kind of

be rapidly increasing over time I hope
 

7719
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:44,590
be rapidly increasing over time I hope
so and even more than that if we

7720

this thing right that I do my one is to
ends and I give feedback to one person

7770
02:37:43,830 --> 02:37:43,840
ends and I give feedback to one person
 

7771
02:37:43,840 --> 02:37:46,469
ends and I give feedback to one person
in front of other people not because I

that
 

7777
02:37:50,560 --> 02:37:51,990
that
we can all learn from each other's

7778
02:37:51,990 --> 02:37:52,000
we can all learn from each other's
 

7779
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,269
we can all learn from each other's
experiences like why should it be that

7780
02:37:54,269 --> 02:37:54,279
experiences like why should it be that
 

7781
02:37:54,279 --> 02:37:56,750
experiences like why should it be that
only you get to learn from your mistakes

7782
02:37:56,750 --> 02:37:56,760
only you get to learn from your mistakes
 

7783
02:37:56,760 --> 02:37:59,150
only you get to learn from your mistakes
other people can also learn or you

7784
02:37:59,150 --> 02:37:59,160
other people can also learn or you
 

7785
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:00,269
other people can also learn or you
another person can also learn from

7786
02:38:00,269 --> 02:38:00,279
another person can also learn from
 

7787
02:38:00,279 --> 02:38:02,790
another person can also learn from
another person's success so that was

7788
02:38:02,790 --> 02:38:02,800
another person's success so that was
 

7789
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:06,110
another person's success so that was
inside that okay like why couldn't you

7790
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:06,120
inside that okay like why couldn't you
 

7791
02:38:06,120 --> 02:38:09,870
inside that okay like why couldn't you
broadcast what you learned from one Q&A

7792
02:38:09,870 --> 02:38:09,880
broadcast what you learned from one Q&A
 

7793
02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:11,630
broadcast what you learned from one Q&A
session on perplexity to the rest of the

7794
02:38:11,630 --> 02:38:11,640
session on perplexity to the rest of the
 

7795
02:38:11,640 --> 02:38:14,230
session on perplexity to the rest of the
world and so I want more such things

7796
02:38:14,230 --> 02:38:14,240
world and so I want more such things
 

7797
02:38:14,240 --> 02:38:16,550
world and so I want more such things
this is just a start of something more

7798
02:38:16,550 --> 02:38:16,560

really interesting so there's the uh the
 

7831
02:38:49,720 --> 02:38:51,349
really interesting so there's the uh the
natural perplexity interface where you

7832
02:38:51,349 --> 02:38:51,359
natural perplexity interface where you
 

7833
02:38:51,359 --> 02:38:53,349
natural perplexity interface where you
just ask questions Q&A and you have this

7834
02:38:53,349 --> 02:38:53,359
just ask questions Q&A and you have this
 

7835
02:38:53,359 --> 02:38:56,070
just ask questions Q&A and you have this
chain you say that that's a kind of

7836
02:38:56,070 --> 02:38:56,080
chain you say that that's a kind of
 

7837
02:38:56,080 --> 02:38:58,110
chain you say that that's a kind of
playground that's a little bit more

private now if you want to take that and
 

7841
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:01,510
private now if you want to take that and
present that to the world in a little

7842
02:39:01,510 --> 02:39:01,520
present that to the world in a little
 

7843
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:03,389
present that to the world in a little
bit more organized way first of all you

7844
02:39:03,389 --> 02:39:03,399
bit more organized way first of all you
 

7845
02:39:03,399 --> 02:39:05,750
bit more organized way first of all you
can share that and I have shared that as

7846
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:05,760
can share that and I have shared that as
 

7847
02:39:05,760 --> 02:39:07,750
can share that and I have shared that as
it by itself yeah but if you want to

7848
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:07,760
it by itself yeah but if you want to
 

7849
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:10,230
it by itself yeah but if you want to
organize that in a nice way to create a

7850
02:39:10,230 --> 02:39:10,240
organize that in a nice way to create a
 

7851

organize that in a nice way to create a
Wikipedia style page yeah you can do

7852
02:39:12,750 --> 02:39:12,760
Wikipedia style page yeah you can do
 

7853
02:39:12,760 --> 02:39:14,349
Wikipedia style page yeah you can do
that with perplexity Pages the

7854
02:39:14,349 --> 02:39:14,359
that with perplexity Pages the
 

7855
02:39:14,359 --> 02:39:16,030
that with perplexity Pages the
difference there subtle but I think it's

7856
02:39:16,030 --> 02:39:16,040
difference there subtle but I think it's
 

7857
02:39:16,040 --> 02:39:18,389
difference there subtle but I think it's
a big difference in the actual what it

7858
02:39:18,389 --> 02:39:18,399
a big difference in the actual what it
 

7859
02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:20,510
a big difference in the actual what it
looks like so

7860
02:39:20,510 --> 02:39:20,520
looks like so
 

7861
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:23,030
looks like so
it is true that there is certain

7862
02:39:23,030 --> 02:39:23,040
it is true that there is certain
 

7863
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:26,110
it is true that there is certain
perplexity sessions where I ask really

7864
02:39:26,110 --> 02:39:26,120
perplexity sessions where I ask really
 

7865
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:28,630
perplexity sessions where I ask really
good questions and I discover really

7866
02:39:28,630 --> 02:39:28,640
good questions and I discover really
 

7867
02:39:28,640 --> 02:39:31,950
good questions and I discover really
cool things and that is by itself could

7868
02:39:31,950 --> 02:39:31,960
cool things and that is by itself could
 

7869
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:35,030
cool things and that is by itself could
be a canonical experience that if shared

7870
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:35,040
be a canonical experience that if shared
 

7871
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:36,630
be a canonical experience that if shared
with others they could also see the

lot of thinking going on it's cool thank
 

7955
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:11,790
lot of thinking going on it's cool thank
you uh oh you as a kid I loveed

7956
02:41:11,790 --> 02:41:11,800
you uh oh you as a kid I loveed
 

7957
02:41:11,800 --> 02:41:15,070
you uh oh you as a kid I loveed
Wikipedia rabbit holes a lot yeah oh

7958
02:41:15,070 --> 02:41:15,080
Wikipedia rabbit holes a lot yeah oh
 

7959
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:16,469
Wikipedia rabbit holes a lot yeah oh
yeah going to the draic equation based

7960
02:41:16,469 --> 02:41:16,479
yeah going to the draic equation based
 

7961
02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:17,830
yeah going to the draic equation based
on the search results there is no

7962
02:41:17,830 --> 02:41:17,840
on the search results there is no
 

7963
02:41:17,840 --> 02:41:19,349
on the search results there is no
definitive answer on the exact number of

7964
02:41:19,349 --> 02:41:19,359
definitive answer on the exact number of
 

7965
02:41:19,359 --> 02:41:21,590
definitive answer on the exact number of
alien civilizations in the universe and

7966
02:41:21,590 --> 02:41:21,600
alien civilizations in the universe and
 

7967
02:41:21,600 --> 02:41:23,990
alien civilizations in the universe and
then it goes to the Drake equation uh

7968
02:41:23,990 --> 02:41:24,000
then it goes to the Drake equation uh
 

7969
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,990
then it goes to the Drake equation uh
recent estimates and 20 wow well done

7970
02:41:26,990 --> 02:41:27,000
recent estimates and 20 wow well done
 

7971
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:28,790
recent estimates and 20 wow well done
based on the size of the universe and

7972
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:28,800
based on the size of the universe and
 

7973
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:31,389
based on the size of the universe and
the number of habitable planets

7974
02:41:31,389 --> 02:41:31,399
the number of habitable planets
 

7975
02:41:31,399 --> 02:41:33,590
the number of habitable planets
SEI what are the main factors in the

7976
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:33,600
SEI what are the main factors in the
 

7977
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:34,950
SEI what are the main factors in the
Drake equation how do scientist

7978
02:41:34,950 --> 02:41:34,960
Drake equation how do scientist
 

7979
02:41:34,960 --> 02:41:36,750
Drake equation how do scientist
determine if a planet is habitable yeah

7980
02:41:36,750 --> 02:41:36,760
determine if a planet is habitable yeah
 

7981
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:38,790
determine if a planet is habitable yeah
this is really really really

7982
02:41:38,790 --> 02:41:38,800
this is really really really
 

7983
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:40,710
this is really really really
interesting one of the heartbreaking

7984
02:41:40,710 --> 02:41:40,720
interesting one of the heartbreaking
 

7985
02:41:40,720 --> 02:41:42,830
interesting one of the heartbreaking
things for me recently learning more and

7986
02:41:42,830 --> 02:41:42,840
things for me recently learning more and
 

7987
02:41:42,840 --> 02:41:45,710
things for me recently learning more and
more is how much bias human bias can

7988
02:41:45,710 --> 02:41:45,720
more is how much bias human bias can
 

7989
02:41:45,720 --> 02:41:49,269
more is how much bias human bias can
seep into Wikipedia mhm that yeah so so

7990
02:41:49,269 --> 02:41:49,279
seep into Wikipedia mhm that yeah so so
 

7991
02:41:49,279 --> 02:41:50,870
seep into Wikipedia mhm that yeah so so
Wikipedia is not the only source we use

7992
02:41:50,870 --> 02:41:50,880
Wikipedia is not the only source we use
 

7993
02:41:50,880 --> 02:41:52,910
Wikipedia is not the only source we use
that's why cuz Wikipedia is one of the

02:41:52,910 --> 02:41:52,920
that's why cuz Wikipedia is one of the
 

7995
02:41:52,920 --> 02:41:54,950
that's why cuz Wikipedia is one of the
greatest websites ever created to me

7996
02:41:54,950 --> 02:41:54,960
greatest websites ever created to me
 

7997
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:56,750
greatest websites ever created to me
right it's just so incredible that crowd

7998
02:41:56,750 --> 02:41:56,760
right it's just so incredible that crowd
 

7999
02:41:56,760 --> 02:41:59,990
right it's just so incredible that crowd
Source you can get yeah take such a big

8000
02:41:59,990 --> 02:42:00,000
Source you can get yeah take such a big
 

8001
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,670
Source you can get yeah take such a big
step towards but it's too human control

8002
02:42:02,670 --> 02:42:02,680
step towards but it's too human control
 

8003
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:04,469
step towards but it's too human control
and you need to scale it up yeah which

8004
02:42:04,469 --> 02:42:04,479
and you need to scale it up yeah which
 

8005
02:42:04,479 --> 02:42:06,269
and you need to scale it up yeah which
is why perplexity is the

8006
02:42:06,269 --> 02:42:06,279
is why perplexity is the
 

8007
02:42:06,279 --> 02:42:09,429
is why perplexity is the
right way to go the AI Wikipedia as you

8008
02:42:09,429 --> 02:42:09,439
right way to go the AI Wikipedia as you
 

8009
02:42:09,439 --> 02:42:11,349
right way to go the AI Wikipedia as you
say in the good sense of and discover is

8010
02:42:11,349 --> 02:42:11,359
say in the good sense of and discover is
 

8011
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:14,030
say in the good sense of and discover is
like AI

the solution may not even be starting
another social app like threads tried to

8036
02:42:43,389 --> 02:42:43,399
another social app like threads tried to
 

8037
02:42:43,399 --> 02:42:44,750
another social app like threads tried to
say oh yeah I want to start Twitter

8038
02:42:44,750 --> 02:42:44,760
say oh yeah I want to start Twitter
 

8039
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:47,349
say oh yeah I want to start Twitter
without all the drama but that's not the

8040
02:42:47,349 --> 02:42:47,359
without all the drama but that's not the
 

8041
02:42:47,359 --> 02:42:50,830
without all the drama but that's not the
answer the answer is like like as much

8042
02:42:50,830 --> 02:42:50,840
answer the answer is like like as much
 

8043
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:53,830
answer the answer is like like as much
as possible try to cater the human

8044
02:42:53,830 --> 02:42:53,840
as possible try to cater the human
 

8045
02:42:53,840 --> 02:42:55,710
as possible try to cater the human
curiosity but not the human

8046
02:42:55,710 --> 02:42:55,720
curiosity but not the human
 

8047
02:42:55,720 --> 02:42:57,710
curiosity but not the human
drama yeah but some of that is the

8048
02:42:57,710 --> 02:42:57,720
drama yeah but some of that is the
 

8049
02:42:57,720 --> 02:42:59,910
drama yeah but some of that is the
business model so that if it's an ads

8050
02:42:59,910 --> 02:42:59,920
business model so that if it's an ads
 

8051
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:02,510
business model so that if it's an ads
model then it's easier as a startup to

8052
02:43:02,510 --> 02:43:02,520
model then it's easier as a startup to
 

8053
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:04,349
model then it's easier as a startup to
work on all these things without having

8054
02:43:04,349 --> 02:43:04,359
work on all these things without having
 

8055
02:43:04,359 --> 02:43:06,150
work on all these things without having
all these existing like the drama is

8056
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:06,160
all these existing like the drama is
 

8057
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:07,750
all these existing like the drama is
important for social apps because that's

8058
02:43:07,750 --> 02:43:07,760
important for social apps because that's
 

8059
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:09,950
important for social apps because that's
what drives engagement and advertisers

8060
02:43:09,950 --> 02:43:09,960
what drives engagement and advertisers
 

8061
02:43:09,960 --> 02:43:12,630
what drives engagement and advertisers
need you to show the engagement time

8062
02:43:12,630 --> 02:43:12,640
need you to show the engagement time
 

8063
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:15,269
need you to show the engagement time
yeah and so you know that's a challenge

8064
02:43:15,269 --> 02:43:15,279
yeah and so you know that's a challenge
 

8065
02:43:15,279 --> 02:43:16,710
yeah and so you know that's a challenge
you'll come more and more as perplexity

8066
02:43:16,710 --> 02:43:16,720
you'll come more and more as perplexity
 

8067
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:20,870
you'll come more and more as perplexity
scales up correct as uh figuring out how

8068
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:20,880
scales up correct as uh figuring out how
 

8069
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:25,870
scales up correct as uh figuring out how
to yeah how to avoid the the the

8070
02:43:25,870 --> 02:43:25,880
to yeah how to avoid the the the
 

8071
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:29,790
to yeah how to avoid the the the
delicious temptation of drama maximizing

8072
02:43:29,790 --> 02:43:29,800
delicious temptation of drama maximizing
 

8073
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:32,950
delicious temptation of drama maximizing
engagement ad driven and all that kind

8074

engagement ad driven and all that kind
 

8075
02:43:32,960 --> 02:43:35,309
engagement ad driven and all that kind
of stuff that you know for me personally

8076
02:43:35,309 --> 02:43:35,319
of stuff that you know for me personally
 

8077
02:43:35,319 --> 02:43:37,790
of stuff that you know for me personally
just even just hosting this little

8078
02:43:37,790 --> 02:43:37,800
just even just hosting this little
 

8079
02:43:37,800 --> 02:43:41,389
just even just hosting this little
podcast uh I'm very careful to avoid

8080
02:43:41,389 --> 02:43:41,399
podcast uh I'm very careful to avoid
 

8081
02:43:41,399 --> 02:43:42,910
podcast uh I'm very careful to avoid
caring about views and clicks and all

8082
02:43:42,910 --> 02:43:42,920
caring about views and clicks and all
 

8083
02:43:42,920 --> 02:43:45,349
caring about views and clicks and all
that kind of stuff so that you maximiz

8084
02:43:45,349 --> 02:43:45,359
that kind of stuff so that you maximiz
 

8085
02:43:45,359 --> 02:43:47,990
that kind of stuff so that you maximiz
you don't maximize the wrong thing yeah

02:43:47,990 --> 02:43:48,000
you don't maximize the wrong thing yeah
 

8087
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,190
you don't maximize the wrong thing yeah
you maximize the well actually the thing

8088
02:43:50,190 --> 02:43:50,200
you maximize the well actually the thing
 

8089
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:53,190
you maximize the well actually the thing
I actually mostly try to maximize and

8090

8110
02:44:12,110 --> 02:44:12,120
in terms of guest for podcast and all
 

8111
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:14,150
in terms of guest for podcast and all
that kind of stuff I do also look for

8112
02:44:14,150 --> 02:44:14,160
that kind of stuff I do also look for
 

8113
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:17,349
that kind of stuff I do also look for
crazy wild card type of thing so this it

8114
02:44:17,349 --> 02:44:17,359
crazy wild card type of thing so this it
 

8115
02:44:17,359 --> 02:44:21,150
crazy wild card type of thing so this it
might be nice to have in related even

8116
02:44:21,150 --> 02:44:21,160
might be nice to have in related even
 

8117
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:23,870
might be nice to have in related even
Wilder sort of directions right you know

8118

Wilder sort of directions right you know
 

8119
02:44:23,880 --> 02:44:26,030
Wilder sort of directions right you know
cuz right now it's kind of on topic yeah

8121
02:44:26,040 --> 02:44:29,429
cuz right now it's kind of on topic yeah
that's a good idea that's sort of the RL

8122
02:44:29,429 --> 02:44:29,439
that's a good idea that's sort of the RL
 

8123
02:44:29,439 --> 02:44:32,830
that's a good idea that's sort of the RL
equivalent of the Epsilon greedy yeah

8124
02:44:32,830 --> 02:44:32,840
equivalent of the Epsilon greedy yeah
 

8125
02:44:32,840 --> 02:44:34,750
equivalent of the Epsilon greedy yeah
exactly where you want to increase it oh

8126
02:44:34,750 --> 02:44:34,760
exactly where you want to increase it oh

that'd be cool if you could actually
control that parameter literally I mean

8130
02:44:38,429 --> 02:44:38,439
control that parameter literally I mean
 

8131
02:44:38,439 --> 02:44:41,870
control that parameter literally I mean
yeah just kind of like uh how Wild I

8263
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:20,830
only I don't even know if it's his code
again uh but uh it's a good code uh you

8264
02:47:20,830 --> 02:47:20,840
again uh but uh it's a good code uh you
 

8265
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:22,710
again uh but uh it's a good code uh you
only truly understand something if you

8266
02:47:22,710 --> 02:47:22,720
only truly understand something if you
 

8267
02:47:22,720 --> 02:47:25,190
only truly understand something if you
can explain it to your grandmom or yeah

8268
02:47:25,190 --> 02:47:25,200
can explain it to your grandmom or yeah
 

8269
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:27,830
can explain it to your grandmom or yeah
yeah and also about make it simple but

8270
02:47:27,830 --> 02:47:27,840
yeah and also about make it simple but
 

8271
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:30,030
yeah and also about make it simple but
not too simple yeah that kind of idea

8272
02:47:30,030 --> 02:47:30,040
not too simple yeah that kind of idea
 

8273
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:31,590
not too simple yeah that kind of idea
yeah if if sometimes it just goes too

8274
02:47:31,590 --> 02:47:31,600
yeah if if sometimes it just goes too
 

8275
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,429
yeah if if sometimes it just goes too

but note that there's a trade-off

8312
02:48:17,190 --> 02:48:17,200
but note that there's a trade-off
 

8313
02:48:17,200 --> 02:48:19,510
but note that there's a trade-off

8319
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:27,429

they uh advertise new context window

8320
02:48:27,429 --> 02:48:27,439
they uh advertise new context window
 

8321
02:48:27,439 --> 02:48:30,429
they uh advertise new context window
increase they talk a lot about uh

8322
02:48:30,429 --> 02:48:30,439
increase they talk a lot about uh
 

8323
02:48:30,439 --> 02:48:31,910
increase they talk a lot about uh
finding the needle in the Hast stack

8324

mhm so I think I think that's where uh

02:48:44,630 --> 02:48:44,640
mhm so I think I think that's where uh
 

8333
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:46,830

you need to make sure that throwing more

8334
02:48:46,830 --> 02:48:46,840
you need to make sure that throwing more
 

8335
02:48:46,840 --> 02:48:49,710
you need to make sure that throwing more
information at a model doesn't actually

02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:51,070

make it more

8338
02:48:51,070 --> 02:48:51,080
make it more
 

8339
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:53,349
make it more
confused like like it's just having more

8340
02:48:53,349 --> 02:48:53,359
confused like like it's just having more
 

8341
02:48:53,359 --> 02:48:56,030
confused like like it's just having more
entropy to deal with now and might might

8342
02:48:56,030 --> 02:48:56,040
entropy to deal with now and might might
 

8343
02:48:56,040 --> 02:48:58,070
entropy to deal with now and might might
might even be worse so I think that's

8344
02:48:58,070 --> 02:48:58,080
might even be worse so I think that's
 

8345
02:48:58,080 --> 02:49:01,230
might even be worse so I think that's
important and in terms of what new

8346
02:49:01,230 --> 02:49:01,240
important and in terms of what new
 

8347
02:49:01,240 --> 02:49:04,070
important and in terms of what new
things it can do um I feel like it can

8348
02:49:04,070 --> 02:49:04,080
things it can do um I feel like it can
 

8349
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:07,070
things it can do um I feel like it can
do um internal search a lot better I

8350
02:49:07,070 --> 02:49:07,080
do um internal search a lot better I
 

8351
02:49:07,080 --> 02:49:08,710
do um internal search a lot better I
think that's an area that nobody's

8352
02:49:08,710 --> 02:49:08,720
think that's an area that nobody's

think that's an area that nobody's
really cracked like searching over your

8354
02:49:10,990 --> 02:49:11,000
really cracked like searching over your
 

8355
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,950
really cracked like searching over your
own files like searching over your like

8356
02:49:12,950 --> 02:49:12,960
own files like searching over your like
 

8357
02:49:12,960 --> 02:49:18,750
own files like searching over your like
like like uh Google drive or Dropbox and

8358
02:49:18,750 --> 02:49:18,760
like like uh Google drive or Dropbox and
 

8359
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:20,150
like like uh Google drive or Dropbox and
the reason nobody cracked that is

8360
02:49:20,150 --> 02:49:20,160
the reason nobody cracked that is
 

8361
02:49:20,160 --> 02:49:22,990
the reason nobody cracked that is
because um the indexing that you need to

8362
02:49:22,990 --> 02:49:23,000
because um the indexing that you need to
 

8363
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:24,590
because um the indexing that you need to
build for that is very different nature

8364
02:49:24,590 --> 02:49:24,600
build for that is very different nature
 

8365
02:49:24,600 --> 02:49:27,150
build for that is very different nature
than web indexing

8366
02:49:27,150 --> 02:49:27,160
than web indexing
 

8367
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:30,590
than web indexing
um and uh instead if you can just have

8368
02:49:30,590 --> 02:49:30,600
um and uh instead if you can just have
 

8369
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:32,670
um and uh instead if you can just have
the entire thing dumped into your

8370
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:32,680
the entire thing dumped into your
 

8371
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:36,349
the entire thing dumped into your
prompt and ask it to find something it's

8373
02:49:36,359 --> 02:49:38,870

probably going to be a lot uh more

8374
02:49:38,870 --> 02:49:38,880
probably going to be a lot uh more
 

8375
02:49:38,880 --> 02:49:42,150
probably going to be a lot uh more

02:49:42,150 --> 02:49:42,160
capable and and you know given that the
 

8377
02:49:42,160 --> 02:49:44,190

think this will feel much better even

02:49:45,870 --> 02:49:45,880
think this will feel much better even

02:49:45,880 --> 02:49:48,229
think this will feel much better even

02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:28,750
or data structure it knows when to keep
it in the prompt and I like more

8418
02:50:28,750 --> 02:50:28,760
it in the prompt and I like more
 

8419
02:50:28,760 --> 02:50:31,349
it in the prompt and I like more
efficient things systems that know when

needed I think that feels much more an
 

8427
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:38,870
needed I think that feels much more an
efficient architecture than just

8428
02:50:38,870 --> 02:50:38,880
efficient architecture than just
 

8429
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:40,550

where we spend more time talking to AI

8530
02:52:42,750 --> 02:52:42,760
where we spend more time talking to AI
 

8531
02:52:42,760 --> 02:52:45,070
where we spend more time talking to AI
than other humans uh at least for at

8532
02:52:45,070 --> 02:52:45,080
than other humans uh at least for at
 

8533
02:52:45,080 --> 02:52:47,590
than other humans uh at least for at
work time like it's easier not to bother

8534
02:52:47,590 --> 02:52:47,600
work time like it's easier not to bother

02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:52,200
instead you just ask a tool but I hope
 

8539
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:54,950
instead you just ask a tool but I hope
that gives us more time to like build

8540
02:52:54,950 --> 02:52:54,960
that gives us more time to like build
 

8541
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:56,349
that gives us more time to like build
more relationships and connections with

harder
path yeah it is a hard path although I

8682
02:55:37,830 --> 02:55:37,840
path yeah it is a hard path although I
 

8683
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:40,389
path yeah it is a hard path although I
would say that human AI connection is

8684
02:55:40,389 --> 02:55:40,399
would say that human AI connection is
 

8685
02:55:40,399 --> 02:55:43,150
would say that human AI connection is
also a hard path to do it well in a way

8686
02:55:43,150 --> 02:55:43,160
also a hard path to do it well in a way
 

8687
02:55:43,160 --> 02:55:44,630
also a hard path to do it well in a way
that humans flourish but it's a

8688
02:55:44,630 --> 02:55:44,640
that humans flourish but it's a
 

8689
02:55:44,640 --> 02:55:46,349
that humans flourish but it's a
fundamentally different problem it feels

8690
02:55:46,349 --> 02:55:46,359
fundamentally different problem it feels
 

8691
02:55:46,359 --> 02:55:49,150
fundamentally different problem it feels
dangerous to me what the reason is that

8692
02:55:49,150 --> 02:55:49,160
dangerous to me what the reason is that
 

8693
02:55:49,160 --> 02:55:50,950
dangerous to me what the reason is that
you can get short-term dopamine hits

8694
02:55:50,950 --> 02:55:50,960
you can get short-term dopamine hits
 

8695
02:55:50,960 --> 02:55:52,750
you can get short-term dopamine hits
from someone seemingly appearing to care

8696
02:55:52,750 --> 02:55:52,760
from someone seemingly appearing to care
 

8697
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:54,830
from someone seemingly appearing to care
for you absolutely I should say the same

8698
02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:54,840
for you absolutely I should say the same
 

8699
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:56,790
for you absolutely I should say the same
thing perplexity is trying to solve is

8700
02:55:56,790 --> 02:55:56,800
thing perplexity is trying to solve is
 

8701
02:55:56,800 --> 02:55:58,950
thing perplexity is trying to solve is
also feels dangerous because you're

8702
02:55:58,950 --> 02:55:58,960
also feels dangerous because you're
 

8703
02:55:58,960 --> 02:56:02,309
also feels dangerous because you're
trying to present truth and that can be

8704
02:56:02,309 --> 02:56:02,319
trying to present truth and that can be
 

8705
02:56:02,319 --> 02:56:04,429
trying to present truth and that can be
manipulated with more and more power

8706
02:56:04,429 --> 02:56:04,439
manipulated with more and more power
 

8707
02:56:04,439 --> 02:56:06,910
manipulated with more and more power
that's gained right so to do it right

8708
02:56:06,910 --> 02:56:06,920
that's gained right so to do it right
 

8709
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:09,070
that's gained right so to do it right
yeah to do knowledge Discovery and Truth

8710
02:56:09,070 --> 02:56:09,080
yeah to do knowledge Discovery and Truth
 

8711
02:56:09,080 --> 02:56:11,510
yeah to do knowledge Discovery and Truth
Discovery in the right way in an

8712
02:56:11,510 --> 02:56:11,520
Discovery in the right way in an
 

8713
02:56:11,520 --> 02:56:13,950
Discovery in the right way in an
unbiased way in a way that we're

8714
02:56:13,950 --> 02:56:13,960
unbiased way in a way that we're
 

8715
02:56:13,960 --> 02:56:16,150
unbiased way in a way that we're
constantly expanding our understanding

8716
02:56:16,150 --> 02:56:16,160
constantly expanding our understanding
 

8717
02:56:16,160 --> 02:56:19,469
constantly expanding our understanding
of others and wisd about the world

that's really hard but at least there is

8720
02:56:21,309 --> 02:56:21,319
that's really hard but at least there is
 

8721
02:56:21,319 --> 02:56:23,389
that's really hard but at least there is
a science to it that we understand like

8722
02:56:23,389 --> 02:56:23,399
a science to it that we understand like
 

8723
02:56:23,399 --> 02:56:25,469
a science to it that we understand like
what is truth like at least to a certain

what is truth like at least to a certain
 

8725
02:56:25,479 --> 02:56:28,469
what is truth like at least to a certain
extent we know that through our academic

8726
02:56:28,469 --> 02:56:28,479
extent we know that through our academic
 

8727
02:56:28,479 --> 02:56:29,870
extent we know that through our academic
backgrounds like truth needs to be

8728
02:56:29,870 --> 02:56:29,880
backgrounds like truth needs to be
 

8729
02:56:29,880 --> 02:56:31,870
backgrounds like truth needs to be
scientifically backed and like like peer

8730
02:56:31,870 --> 02:56:31,880
scientifically backed and like like peer
 

8731
02:56:31,880 --> 02:56:33,349
scientifically backed and like like peer
reviewed and like bunch of people have

8732
02:56:33,349 --> 02:56:33,359
reviewed and like bunch of people have
 

8733
02:56:33,359 --> 02:56:37,309
reviewed and like bunch of people have
to agree on it uh sure I'm not saying it

8734
02:56:37,309 --> 02:56:37,319
to agree on it uh sure I'm not saying it
 

8735
02:56:37,319 --> 02:56:38,710
to agree on it uh sure I'm not saying it
doesn't have its flaws and there are

8736
02:56:38,710 --> 02:56:38,720
doesn't have its flaws and there are
 

8737
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:41,510
doesn't have its flaws and there are
things that are widely debated but here

8738
02:56:41,510 --> 02:56:41,520
things that are widely debated but here
 

8739
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:43,750
things that are widely debated but here
I think like you can just

8740
02:56:43,750 --> 02:56:43,760
I think like you can just
 

8741
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:46,550
I think like you can just
appear not to have any true emotional

8742
02:56:46,550 --> 02:56:46,560
appear not to have any true emotional
 

8743
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:48,750
appear not to have any true emotional
connection so so you can appear to have

8744
02:56:48,750 --> 02:56:48,760
connection so so you can appear to have
 

8745
02:56:48,760 --> 02:56:51,150
connection so so you can appear to have
a true emotional connection but not have

8746
02:56:51,150 --> 02:56:51,160
a true emotional connection but not have
 

8747
02:56:51,160 --> 02:56:54,110

anything sure like like do we have
 

8749
02:56:54,120 --> 02:56:56,110
anything sure like like do we have
personal AIS that are truly representing

our interest today no right but that's

8752
02:56:59,590 --> 02:56:59,600
our interest today no right but that's
 

8753
02:56:59,600 --> 02:57:01,110

02:59:05,429 --> 02:59:05,439
a dystopia what uh what gives you hope
 

8863
02:59:05,439 --> 02:59:06,590
a dystopia what uh what gives you hope
about the

8864
02:59:06,590 --> 02:59:06,600
about the
 

8865
02:59:06,600 --> 02:59:09,349
about the
future again I'm I'm I'm kind of beating

8866
02:59:09,349 --> 02:59:09,359
future again I'm I'm I'm kind of beating
 

8867
02:59:09,359 --> 02:59:10,710
future again I'm I'm I'm kind of beating
the drum here

8868
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:10,720
the drum here
 

8869
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:14,389
the drum here
but uh for me it's all about like

8870
02:59:14,389 --> 02:59:14,399
but uh for me it's all about like
 

8871
02:59:14,399 --> 02:59:18,710
but uh for me it's all about like
curiosity and knowledge and like I think

8872
02:59:18,710 --> 02:59:18,720
curiosity and knowledge and like I think
 

8873
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:20,550
curiosity and knowledge and like I think
there are different ways to keep the

8874
02:59:20,550 --> 02:59:20,560
there are different ways to keep the
 

8875
02:59:20,560 --> 02:59:21,990
there are different ways to keep the
light of

8876
02:59:21,990 --> 02:59:22,000
light of

Consciousness preserving

8878
02:59:24,190 --> 02:59:24,200
Consciousness preserving
 

8879
02:59:24,200 --> 02:59:27,429
Consciousness preserving
it and we all can go about in different

8880
02:59:27,429 --> 02:59:27,439
it and we all can go about in different
 

8881
02:59:27,439 --> 02:59:30,269
it and we all can go about in different
paths for us it's about making sure

8882
02:59:30,269 --> 02:59:30,279
paths for us it's about making sure
 

8883
02:59:30,279 --> 02:59:32,830
paths for us it's about making sure

very narrow and shallow conceptions of

03:00:35,990 --> 03:00:36,000
very narrow and shallow conceptions of

03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:39,830
very narrow and shallow conceptions of
the world different truths on each side

the world different truths on each side
 

8937
03:00:39,840 --> 03:00:43,469
the world different truths on each side
and uh so bridging that that's what real

and uh so bridging that that's what real

and uh so bridging that that's what real
uh understanding looks like real truth

8940
03:00:45,710 --> 03:00:45,720
uh understanding looks like real truth
 

8941
03:00:45,720 --> 03:00:47,790
uh understanding looks like real truth
looks like and it feels like AI can do

8942
03:00:47,790 --> 03:00:47,800
looks like and it feels like AI can do
 

8943
03:00:47,800 --> 03:00:51,309
looks like and it feels like AI can do
that better than uh than humans do

8944
03:00:51,309 --> 03:00:51,319
that better than uh than humans do
 

8945
03:00:51,319 --> 03:00:52,990
that better than uh than humans do
because humans really inject their

8946
03:00:52,990 --> 03:00:53,000
because humans really inject their
 

8947
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,590
because humans really inject their
biases into stuff and I hope that

8948
03:00:55,590 --> 03:00:55,600
biases into stuff and I hope that
 

8949
03:00:55,600 --> 03:00:57,269
biases into stuff and I hope that
through AI

8950
03:00:57,269 --> 03:00:57,279
through AI
 

8951
03:00:57,279 --> 03:01:00,830
through AI
humans reduce their biases to me that

8952
03:01:00,830 --> 03:01:00,840
humans reduce their biases to me that
 

8953
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:03,790
humans reduce their biases to me that
that represents a positive outlook

8954

that represents a positive outlook
 

8955
03:01:03,800 --> 03:01:06,349
that represents a positive outlook
towards the future where AI can all help
