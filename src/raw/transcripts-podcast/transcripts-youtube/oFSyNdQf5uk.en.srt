problem with how that gets brought
up you're talking about the future of

1226
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,600
up you're talking about the future of
 

1227
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,510
up you're talking about the future of
the security of Israel even some people

1228
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
the security of Israel even some people
 

1229
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,350
the security of Israel even some people
that speak about it uh seemingly from a

1230
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:34,360
that speak about it uh seemingly from a
 

1231
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,789
that speak about it uh seemingly from a
place of being well-meaning that say the

1232
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:35,799
place of being well-meaning that say the
 

1233
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,190
place of being well-meaning that say the
only way that Israel can have its

1234
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:37,200
only way that Israel can have its
 

1235
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,269
only way that Israel can have its
Security is to stop killing Palestinians

1236
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:40,279
Security is to stop killing Palestinians
 

1237
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:43,310
Security is to stop killing Palestinians
and so the future of Israel depends upon

and so the future of Israel depends upon
 

1239
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,230
and so the future of Israel depends upon
Palestinians not hating Israel so much

1240
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:45,240
Palestinians not hating Israel so much
 

1241
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,990
Palestinians not hating Israel so much
and so we've got to stop tormenting

and so we've got to stop tormenting
 

1243
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,909
and so we've got to stop tormenting
these people so that they don't grow up

1244
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:48,919
these people so that they don't grow up
 

1245
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:51,510
these people so that they don't grow up
to want to torment us you've already

to want to torment us you've already
decided then whose life is worth more

1248
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:53,440
decided then whose life is worth more
 

1249
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,430
decided then whose life is worth more
than the other and so instead of talking

1250
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:56,440
than the other and so instead of talking
 

1251
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,269
than the other and so instead of talking
about the future

1252
00:26:58,269 --> 00:26:58,279

about the present of Palestinian lives
 

1257
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,710
about the present of Palestinian lives
instead of talking about whether or not

1258
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:04,720
instead of talking about whether or not
 

1259
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,669
instead of talking about whether or not
your state will be secure in the

1260
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:06,679
your state will be secure in the
 

1261
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:09,230

killing children now 2third of the
 

1265
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,549
killing children now 2third of the
30,000 civilians are women and children

30,000 civilians are women and children
 

1267
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,310
30,000 civilians are women and children
and so uh we can't talk about what these

children are going to grow up in the
first place and that should be what

first place and that should be what
 

1277
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,389
first place and that should be what
dominates our conscience right now and

secondary to ending a genocide that is
ongoing in the course of this

01:15:05,229 --> 01:15:05,239
ongoing in the course of this
 

3565
01:15:05,239 --> 01:15:07,510
ongoing in the course of this
discussion it's not an exaggeration to

01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:07,520
discussion it's not an exaggeration to
 

3567
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,470
discussion it's not an exaggeration to
say that at least 30 40 people would

3568
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:09,480
say that at least 30 40 people would
 

3569
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,229
say that at least 30 40 people would
have been killed just over the last few

3570
01:15:11,229 --> 01:15:11,239
have been killed just over the last few
 

3571
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:14,430
have been killed just over the last few
hours because we're averaging 135 to 150

3572
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:14,440
hours because we're averaging 135 to 150
 

3573
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,709
hours because we're averaging 135 to 150
a day

a day
 

3575
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,070
a day
so everything else is secondary to that

3576
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:20,080
so everything else is secondary to that
 

3577
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,310
so everything else is secondary to that
this is where we all need to be right

3578
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:21,320
this is where we all need to be right
 

3579
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,950
this is where we all need to be right

3581
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,470
now as people of conscience how do we
stop this because every single day is

3582
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:25,480
stop this because every single day is
 

3583
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,229
stop this because every single day is
deeply costly do you think there has

3584
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:28,239
deeply costly do you think there has
 

3585
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:30,750
deeply costly do you think there has
been a rise of anti-Semitism and

01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:43,679
refugee two or three times
 

4753
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:47,030
refugee two or three times
already you have no future in

4754
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:47,040
already you have no future in
 

4755
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,189
already you have no future in
sight and then someone comes to you and

4756
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:49,199
sight and then someone comes to you and
 

4757
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:51,390
sight and then someone comes to you and
says I'm going to help you and I'm gonna

4758
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:51,400
says I'm going to help you and I'm gonna
 

4759
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:54,109
says I'm going to help you and I'm gonna
fight back on your behalf of course it's

4760
01:40:54,109 --> 01:40:54,119
fight back on your behalf of course it's
 

4761
01:40:54,119 --> 01:40:56,709
fight back on your behalf of course it's
going to resonate it's human right and

4762
01:40:56,709 --> 01:40:56,719
going to resonate it's human right and
 

4763
01:40:56,719 --> 01:40:58,950
going to resonate it's human right and
so I think that it's important for us to

4764
01:40:58,950 --> 01:40:58,960
so I think that it's important for us to
 

4765
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,629
so I think that it's important for us to
see the world through their eyes rather

4766
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:00,639
see the world through their eyes rather
 

4767
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,950
see the world through their eyes rather
than try to see the world through our

4768
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:02,960
than try to see the world through our
 

4769
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:07,830
than try to see the world through our
eyes so as Malcolm X did you're calling

4770
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:07,840
eyes so as Malcolm X did you're calling
 

4771
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,510
eyes so as Malcolm X did you're calling
for highlighting the asymmetry in

4772
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:10,520
for highlighting the asymmetry in
 

4773
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:13,189
for highlighting the asymmetry in
violence and asymmetry in moral

4774
01:41:13,189 --> 01:41:13,199
violence and asymmetry in moral
 

4775
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:14,629
violence and asymmetry in moral
reasoning

4776
01:41:14,629 --> 01:41:14,639
reasoning
 

4777
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:17,350
reasoning
absolutely it's important you're not

4778
01:41:17,350 --> 01:41:17,360
absolutely it's important you're not
 

4779
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,950
absolutely it's important you're not
going to be able to solve this problem

4780
01:41:18,950 --> 01:41:18,960
going to be able to solve this problem
 

4781
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,629
going to be able to solve this problem
unless you're able to do that and so

4782
01:41:21,629 --> 01:41:21,639
unless you're able to do that and so
 

4783
01:41:21,639 --> 01:41:24,070
unless you're able to do that and so
when when Malcolm said uh that if you

4784
01:41:24,070 --> 01:41:24,080
when when Malcolm said uh that if you
 

4785
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:27,510
when when Malcolm said uh that if you
stick a knife 9 in into my back and pull

4786
01:41:27,510 --> 01:41:27,520
stick a knife 9 in into my back and pull
 

4787
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,669
stick a knife 9 in into my back and pull
it out 6

4788
01:41:28,669 --> 01:41:28,679
it out 6
 

4789
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:31,510
it out 6
in that's not progress progress is

4790
01:41:31,510 --> 01:41:31,520
in that's not progress progress is
 

4791
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:33,589
in that's not progress progress is
healing the wound and you're not even

4792
01:41:33,589 --> 01:41:33,599

4793
01:41:33,599 --> 01:41:35,070

willing to acknowledge that the knife is
 

4795
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:38,310
willing to acknowledge that the knife is
there yet those that don't acknowledge

01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:38,320
there yet those that don't acknowledge

to still laugh and find Joy despite
 

4901

right now just has to be towards

right now just has to be towards
 

4907

right now just has to be towards

place you mentioned that Palestinians
 

5239
01:51:45,119 --> 01:51:47,390

invoke the plight of indigenous people

5240
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:47,400
invoke the plight of indigenous people
 

5241
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,669
invoke the plight of indigenous people
like Native

Americans what works and doesn't work

5244
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:51,119
Americans what works and doesn't work
 

5245
01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:53,270
Americans what works and doesn't work
about this analogy so I think that

5246
01:51:53,270 --> 01:51:53,280
about this analogy so I think that
 

5247
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:55,470
about this analogy so I think that
there's a powerful connection between

5248
01:51:55,470 --> 01:51:55,480
there's a powerful connection between
 

5249
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:57,189
there's a powerful connection between
the Palestinian people and the

5250
01:51:57,189 --> 01:51:57,199
the Palestinian people and the
 

5251
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:58,830
the Palestinian people and the
indigenous and this land and in other

5252
01:51:58,830 --> 01:51:58,840
indigenous and this land and in other
 

5253
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:01,510
indigenous and this land and in other
places um that have been

5254
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:01,520
places um that have been
 

5255
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:04,390
places um that have been
wronged uh we are living here in the

5256
01:52:04,390 --> 01:52:04,400
wronged uh we are living here in the
 

5257
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:06,830
wronged uh we are living here in the
United States on Stolen lands that is

5258
01:52:06,830 --> 01:52:06,840
United States on Stolen lands that is
 

5259
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,470
United States on Stolen lands that is
drenched in the blood of the

5260
01:52:09,470 --> 01:52:09,480
drenched in the blood of the
 

5261
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:12,589
drenched in the blood of the
natives and that was built upon uh with

5262
01:52:12,589 --> 01:52:12,599
natives and that was built upon uh with
 

5263
01:52:12,599 --> 01:52:16,910
natives and that was built upon uh with
the Blood Sweat and labor of enslaved

5264
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:16,920
the Blood Sweat and labor of enslaved
 

5265
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,629
the Blood Sweat and labor of enslaved
Africans that were brought from

5266
01:52:18,629 --> 01:52:18,639
Africans that were brought from
 

5267
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:21,109
Africans that were brought from
overseas so

5268
01:52:21,109 --> 01:52:21,119
overseas so
 

5269
01:52:21,119 --> 01:52:24,189
overseas so
great evil that we have to reckon with

5270
01:52:24,189 --> 01:52:24,199
great evil that we have to reckon with
 

5271
01:52:24,199 --> 01:52:26,229
great evil that we have to reckon with
constantly and so I think that's the

5272
01:52:26,229 --> 01:52:26,239
constantly and so I think that's the
 

5273
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:27,910
constantly and so I think that's the
power of solidarity and you know if you

5274
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:27,920
power of solidarity and you know if you
 

5275
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:30,189
power of solidarity and you know if you
look in Canada and you look in places

5276
01:52:30,189 --> 01:52:30,199
look in Canada and you look in places
 

5277
01:52:30,199 --> 01:52:30,950
look in Canada and you look in places
like

5278
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:30,960
like
 

5279
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,310
like
Australia uh there has been a refocus on

5280
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:34,320
Australia uh there has been a refocus on
 

5281
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,229
Australia uh there has been a refocus on
the crimes against the indigenous of

5282
01:52:36,229 --> 01:52:36,239
the crimes against the indigenous of
 

5283
01:52:36,239 --> 01:52:39,270
the crimes against the indigenous of
those places I think that what

5284
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:39,280
those places I think that what
 

5285
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:43,589
those places I think that what
makes the Palestinian plight

5286
01:52:43,589 --> 01:52:43,599
makes the Palestinian plight
 

5287
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:46,470
makes the Palestinian plight
um deeply painful and maybe where the

5288
01:52:46,470 --> 01:52:46,480
um deeply painful and maybe where the
 

5289
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:50,589
um deeply painful and maybe where the
analogy uh even doesn't do J

5290
01:52:50,589 --> 01:52:50,599
analogy uh even doesn't do J
 

5291
01:52:50,599 --> 01:52:53,109
analogy uh even doesn't do J
Justice is that from the river to the

5292
01:52:53,109 --> 01:52:53,119
Justice is that from the river to the
 

5293
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:56,589
Justice is that from the river to the
sea is less than 500 times what the

5294
01:52:56,589 --> 01:52:56,599
sea is less than 500 times what the
 

5295
01:52:56,599 --> 01:52:58,790
sea is less than 500 times what the
United States is in terms of land it's

5296
01:52:58,790 --> 01:52:58,800
United States is in terms of land it's
 

5297
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,870
United States is in terms of land it's
not that big of a piece of land and so

5298
01:53:01,870 --> 01:53:01,880
not that big of a piece of land and so
 

5299
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,910
not that big of a piece of land and so
the original lie

5300
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:03,920
the original lie
 

5301
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,109
the original lie
was a land without a people for a people

5302
01:53:07,109 --> 01:53:07,119
was a land without a people for a people
 

5303
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:10,589
was a land without a people for a people
without a land and the problem was that

5304
01:53:10,589 --> 01:53:10,599
without a land and the problem was that
 

5305
01:53:10,599 --> 01:53:13,229
without a land and the problem was that
there were people on that land that were

5306
01:53:13,229 --> 01:53:13,239
there were people on that land that were
 

5307
01:53:13,239 --> 01:53:15,430
there were people on that land that were
forcibly removed so I think that the

5308
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:15,440
forcibly removed so I think that the
 

5309
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,229
forcibly removed so I think that the
sheer size right we're talking about a

5310
01:53:18,229 --> 01:53:18,239
sheer size right we're talking about a
 

5311
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:21,910
sheer size right we're talking about a
tiny piece of land and a lot of people

5312
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:21,920
tiny piece of land and a lot of people
 

5313
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:25,310
tiny piece of land and a lot of people
that were uh removed uh forcefully from

5314
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:25,320
that were uh removed uh forcefully from
 

5315
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:28,189
that were uh removed uh forcefully from
their land and uh that continue to be

5316
01:53:28,189 --> 01:53:28,199
their land and uh that continue to be
 

5317
01:53:28,199 --> 01:53:31,830
their land and uh that continue to be
brutalized under those miserable

5318
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:31,840

the legislation that was necessary for
 

5435
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:09,990
the legislation that was necessary for
the time but with the same

5436
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:10,000
the time but with the same
 

5437
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,430
the time but with the same
message so the messages fundamentally

5438
01:56:12,430 --> 01:56:12,440
message so the messages fundamentally
 

5439
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:14,669
message so the messages fundamentally
the same is there a difference in

5440
01:56:14,669 --> 01:56:14,679
the same is there a difference in
 

5441
01:56:14,679 --> 01:56:17,470
the same is there a difference in
emphasis for example the emphasis on

5442
01:56:17,470 --> 01:56:17,480

5445
01:56:20,079 --> 01:56:21,950
Love With Jesus yeah yeah you know this
is it's like when you talk about MLK and

5446
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:21,960
is it's like when you talk about MLK and
 

5447
01:56:21,960 --> 01:56:24,950
is it's like when you talk about MLK and
Malcolm to an extent ex except there was

5448
01:56:24,950 --> 01:56:24,960
Malcolm to an extent ex except there was
 

5449
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,310
Malcolm to an extent ex except there was
actually some difference right between

5450
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:26,320
actually some difference right between
 

5451
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,950
actually some difference right between
MLK and Malcolm yes uh you know I just

5452
01:56:28,950 --> 01:56:28,960
MLK and Malcolm yes uh you know I just
 

5453
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:30,470
MLK and Malcolm yes uh you know I just
think that the difference is exaggerated

5454
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:30,480
think that the difference is exaggerated
 

5455
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:34,109
think that the difference is exaggerated
between them but um I I don't think that

5456
01:56:34,109 --> 01:56:34,119
between them but um I I don't think that
 

5457
01:56:34,119 --> 01:56:36,470
between them but um I I don't think that
Moses didn't emphasize love but Jesus

5458
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:36,480
Moses didn't emphasize love but Jesus
 

5459
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,189
Moses didn't emphasize love but Jesus
emphasized love and then Muhammad didn't

5460
01:56:38,189 --> 01:56:38,199
emphasized love and then Muhammad didn't
 

5461
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:39,990
emphasized love and then Muhammad didn't
emphasize love peace be upon them all I

5462
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:40,000
emphasize love peace be upon them all I
 

5463
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:41,310
emphasize love peace be upon them all I
think that they each

5464
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:41,320
think that they each
 

5465
01:56:41,320 --> 01:56:46,069
think that they each
emphasized um the the same attributes

5466
01:56:46,069 --> 01:56:46,079
emphasized um the the same attributes
 

5467
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:48,510
emphasized um the the same attributes
and and names of God and and ways of

5468
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:48,520
and and names of God and and ways of
 

5469
01:56:48,520 --> 01:56:50,030
and and names of God and and ways of
knowing god

5470
01:56:50,030 --> 01:56:50,040
knowing god
 

5471
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:51,510
knowing god
uh but there were of course changes

5472
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:51,520
uh but there were of course changes
 

5473
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:55,109
uh but there were of course changes
within legislation changes within uh the

5474
01:56:55,109 --> 01:56:55,119
within legislation changes within uh the
 

5475
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:58,149
within legislation changes within uh the
Divine Law but the Divine Spirit uh

5476
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:58,159
Divine Law but the Divine Spirit uh
 

5477
01:56:58,159 --> 01:56:59,870
Divine Law but the Divine Spirit uh
remain the same and so I don't I don't

5478
01:56:59,870 --> 01:56:59,880
remain the same and so I don't I don't
 

5479
01:56:59,880 --> 01:57:02,750
remain the same and so I don't I don't
see them as being counter uh to each

5480
01:57:02,750 --> 01:57:02,760
see them as being counter uh to each
 

5481
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:06,310
see them as being counter uh to each
other uh nor do I see that any Prophet

5482
01:57:06,310 --> 01:57:06,320
other uh nor do I see that any Prophet
 

5483
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:09,270
other uh nor do I see that any Prophet
um betrayed the message that came before

5484
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:09,280
um betrayed the message that came before
 

5485
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:10,629
um betrayed the message that came before
them I think they're all part of the

5486
01:57:10,629 --> 01:57:10,639
them I think they're all part of the
 

5487
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,149
them I think they're all part of the
same beautiful

5488
01:57:12,149 --> 01:57:12,159
same beautiful
 

5489
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:14,950
same beautiful
message that we have to be at Harmony

5490
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:14,960
message that we have to be at Harmony
 

5491
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:17,510
message that we have to be at Harmony
with our creator and that we turn

5492
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,520
with our creator and that we turn
 

5493
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,069
with our creator and that we turn
towards him for our guidance

5494
01:57:20,069 --> 01:57:20,079
towards him for our guidance
 

5495
01:57:20,079 --> 01:57:23,229
towards him for our guidance
and that when we do so uh we establish

5496
01:57:23,229 --> 01:57:23,239
and that when we do so uh we establish
 

5497
01:57:23,239 --> 01:57:26,189
and that when we do so uh we establish
uh a greater uh a greater existence here

5498
01:57:26,189 --> 01:57:26,199
uh a greater uh a greater existence here
 

5499
01:57:26,199 --> 01:57:27,790
uh a greater uh a greater existence here
on Earth and so I think that that's

5500
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:27,800
on Earth and so I think that that's
 

5501
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,390
on Earth and so I think that that's
something that's consistent throughout

something that's consistent throughout
 

5503

01:58:54,079 --> 01:58:56,870
so it's complic at um look I I I expect
more from people in the face of a

01:58:56,870 --> 01:58:56,880
more from people in the face of a
 

5569
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:59,030
more from people in the face of a
genocide we don't have to agree on all

5570
01:58:59,030 --> 01:58:59,040
genocide we don't have to agree on all
 

5571
01:58:59,040 --> 01:58:59,790
genocide we don't have to agree on all
the

5572
01:58:59,790 --> 01:58:59,800
the
 

5573
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,790
the
particulars but we can agree that what

5574
01:59:01,790 --> 01:59:01,800
particulars but we can agree that what
 

5575
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:05,709
particulars but we can agree that what
is happening is morally outrageous and

5576
01:59:05,709 --> 01:59:05,719
is happening is morally outrageous and
 

5577
01:59:05,719 --> 01:59:08,189
is happening is morally outrageous and
so I think that

5578
01:59:08,189 --> 01:59:08,199
so I think that
 

5579
01:59:08,199 --> 01:59:10,270
so I think that
um I've had a few people that have

5580
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:10,280
um I've had a few people that have
 

5581
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:12,470
um I've had a few people that have
reached out and said I want to say

5582
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:12,480
reached out and said I want to say
 

5583
01:59:12,480 --> 01:59:14,310
reached out and said I want to say
something but I

5584
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:14,320
something but I

01:59:14,320 --> 01:59:16,510
something but I
can't and I've had to respond with

5586
01:59:16,510 --> 01:59:16,520
can't and I've had to respond with
 

5587
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:19,310
can't and I've had to respond with
that's not good enough so I think that

5588
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:19,320
that's not good enough so I think that
 

5589
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:22,750
that's not good enough so I think that
we have a we have a problem and instead

5590
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:22,760
we have a we have a problem and instead
 

5591
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:24,430
we have a we have a problem and instead
of focusing on that problem I'd like to

5592
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:24,440
of focusing on that problem I'd like to
 

5593
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:26,149
of focusing on that problem I'd like to
focus on the more morally consistent

5594
01:59:26,149 --> 01:59:26,159
focus on the more morally consistent
 

5595
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:28,950
focus on the more morally consistent

5597
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:31,189
voices across Fates that have risen to
the moment rather than those that have

how to not see everyone outside of our

6504
02:19:27,349 --> 02:19:27,359
how to not see everyone outside of our
 

6505
02:19:27,359 --> 02:19:29,070
how to not see everyone outside of our
borders as

6506
02:19:29,070 --> 02:19:29,080
borders as
 

6507
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:32,870
borders as
threats and people that are different

6509
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:35,910
threats and people that are different
from us within our borders as threats

6510
02:19:35,910 --> 02:19:35,920
from us within our borders as threats
 

6511
02:19:35,920 --> 02:19:37,150
from us within our borders as threats
we're going to have to start seeing

6513
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:40,549
we're going to have to start seeing
people as people and so my hope would be

02:19:40,549 --> 02:19:40,559
people as people and so my hope would be
 

6515
02:19:40,559 --> 02:19:44,030
people as people and so my hope would be
that we would have made people

6516
02:19:44,030 --> 02:19:44,040
that we would have made people
 

6517
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:45,549
that we would have made people
uncomfortable enough to

6518
02:19:45,549 --> 02:19:45,559
uncomfortable enough to
 

6519
02:19:45,559 --> 02:19:48,150
uncomfortable enough to
transcend some of the barriers in their

hearts and some of the barriers that we
have in the world that don't allow us to

have in the world that don't allow us to
 

6525
02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:56,190
