basically yeah I don't so what does
 

51
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,390
basically yeah I don't so what does
Nitro it's just got a lot of caffeine or

something don't ask questions it's
 

55
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,550
something don't ask questions it's
called Nitro do you need to know

56
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
called Nitro do you need to know

59
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,270
anything else it's got It's got nitrogen
in it that's ridiculous I mean what we

60
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
in it that's ridiculous I mean what we
 

61
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,190
in it that's ridiculous I mean what we
breathe is 78% nitrogen anyway what he

62
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:24,200
breathe is 78% nitrogen anyway what he
 

63
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,069
breathe is 78% nitrogen anyway what he
needs to add more

64
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:27,079

 

65
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,310

for you're going toat it most most

66
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:29,320
for you're going toat it most most
 

67
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,429
for you're going toat it most most
people think that they're breathing

68
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:30,439
people think that they're breathing
 

69
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,950
people think that they're breathing
oxygen and they're actually breathing

70
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:31,960
oxygen and they're actually breathing
 

71
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,510

78% nitrogen you need like a Milk Bar

72
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
78% nitrogen you need like a Milk Bar
 

73
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,789
78% nitrogen you need like a Milk Bar
like

74
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
like
 

75
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,310

yeah yeah is that top three kubri film

78
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:43,880
yeah yeah is that top three kubri film
 

79
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,910
yeah yeah is that top three kubri film
for you cluck Orange it's pretty good I

87
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,550

okay uh okay so first let's step back

88
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:57,560
okay uh okay so first let's step back
 

89
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,230
okay uh okay so first let's step back
and uh big congrats on getting your link

90
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
and uh big congrats on getting your link
 

91
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,590
and uh big congrats on getting your link
implanted into a human that's a historic

92
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
implanted into a human that's a historic
 

93
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,149
implanted into a human that's a historic
step for neur link and yeah there's many

94
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
step for neur link and yeah there's many
 

95
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,029
step for neur link and yeah there's many
more to come yeah we're just um

96
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
more to come yeah we're just um
 

97
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,350
more to come yeah we're just um
obviously have a second implant as well

98
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
obviously have a second implant as well
 

99
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,710
obviously have a second implant as well
how did that go uh so far so good there

100
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
how did that go uh so far so good there
 

101
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,550
how did that go uh so far so good there
looks like we've got um I think 400

102
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
looks like we've got um I think 400
 

103
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,070
looks like we've got um I think 400
electrodes that are are providing

104
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,080
electrodes that are are providing
 

105
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,390
electrodes that are are providing
signals so nice yeah how how quickly do

106
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,400
signals so nice yeah how how quickly do
 

107
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,630
signals so nice yeah how how quickly do
you think the number of human

108
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
you think the number of human
 

109
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,670
you think the number of human
participants will scale uh it depends

110
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:28,680
participants will scale uh it depends
 

111
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,750
participants will scale uh it depends
somewh on the regulatory approval the

112
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
somewh on the regulatory approval the
 

113
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,309
somewh on the regulatory approval the
rate which we get regulatory approvals

114
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
rate which we get regulatory approvals
 

115
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,229
rate which we get regulatory approvals
uh

116
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:35,239
uh
 

117
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,869
uh
so we're hoping to do 10 by the end of

118
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:37,879
so we're hoping to do 10 by the end of
 

119
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,470
so we're hoping to do 10 by the end of
this year total of 10 so eight

120
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:41,480
this year total of 10 so eight
 

121
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,949
this year total of 10 so eight
more and with each one you're going to

122
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:43,959
more and with each one you're going to
 

123
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,070
more and with each one you're going to
be learning a lot of lessons about the

124
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
be learning a lot of lessons about the
 

125
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,149
be learning a lot of lessons about the
neurobiology the brain the everything

126
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:49,159
neurobiology the brain the everything
 

127
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,630
neurobiology the brain the everything
the the whole chain of the neuralink the

128
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
the the whole chain of the neuralink the
 

129
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,390
the the whole chain of the neuralink the
decoding this the signal processing all

130
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
decoding this the signal processing all
 

131
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,589
decoding this the signal processing all
that kind of stuff yeah yeah I think

132
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:54,599
that kind of stuff yeah yeah I think
 

133
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,750
that kind of stuff yeah yeah I think
it's obviously going to get better with

134
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
it's obviously going to get better with
 

135
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,630
it's obviously going to get better with
with each one um I mean I don't want to

136
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:58,640
with each one um I mean I don't want to
 

137
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,550
with each one um I mean I don't want to
jinx it but it it seems to have gone

138
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:01,560
jinx it but it it seems to have gone
 

139
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,830
jinx it but it it seems to have gone
extremely well with the second uh

140
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
extremely well with the second uh
 

141
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,430
extremely well with the second uh
implant so there's a a lot of signal a

142
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
implant so there's a a lot of signal a
 

143
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,830
implant so there's a a lot of signal a
lot of elrods it's working very well

144
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
lot of elrods it's working very well
 

145
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,589
lot of elrods it's working very well
what improvements do you think we'll see

146
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
what improvements do you think we'll see
 

147
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,710
what improvements do you think we'll see
in neur Link in the

148
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:13,720
in neur Link in the
 

149
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,470
in neur Link in the
coming let's say let's get crazy coming

150
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
coming let's say let's get crazy coming
 

151
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,990
coming let's say let's get crazy coming
years I mean in years it's going to be

152
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
years I mean in years it's going to be
 

153
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,030
years I mean in years it's going to be
gigantic um because we'll increase the

154
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
gigantic um because we'll increase the
 

155
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,789
gigantic um because we'll increase the
number of electrodes

156
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
number of electrodes
 

157
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,229
number of electrodes
dramatically um will improve the signal

158
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
dramatically um will improve the signal
 

159
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,229
dramatically um will improve the signal
processing so you know we with with uh

160
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
processing so you know we with with uh
 

161
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,149
processing so you know we with with uh
even with only roughly I don't know 10

162
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
even with only roughly I don't know 10
 

163
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,429
even with only roughly I don't know 10
15% of the electrodes working with uh

164
00:03:36,429 --> 00:03:36,439
15% of the electrodes working with uh
 

165
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,030
15% of the electrodes working with uh
with Noland with our first patient we

166
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
with Noland with our first patient we
 

167
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,429
with Noland with our first patient we
were able to get to achieve a bits per

168
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:42,439
were able to get to achieve a bits per
 

169
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,949
were able to get to achieve a bits per
second that's twice the world record so

170
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:45,959
second that's twice the world record so
 

171
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,750
second that's twice the world record so
I think we'll we'll we'll start like

172
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
I think we'll we'll we'll start like
 

173
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,710
I think we'll we'll we'll start like
vastly exceeding world record by orders

174
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:49,720
vastly exceeding world record by orders
 

175
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,750
vastly exceeding world record by orders
of magnitude in the years to come so

176
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
of magnitude in the years to come so
 

177
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,110
of magnitude in the years to come so
it's like getting to I don't know 100

178
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
it's like getting to I don't know 100
 

179
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,390
it's like getting to I don't know 100
bits per second, you know

180
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
bits per second, you know
 

181
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,789
bits per second, you know
maybe maybe if like five years from now

182
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
maybe maybe if like five years from now
 

183
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,990
maybe maybe if like five years from now
we might be at a megabit

184
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,000
we might be at a megabit
 

185
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,270
we might be at a megabit
like faster than any human could

186
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,280
like faster than any human could
 

187
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,350
like faster than any human could

00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:07,959
speaking Yeah that BPS is an interesting
 

191
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,990

metric to measure there might be a big

192
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
metric to measure there might be a big
 

193
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,550

195
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,270

the quality of intellectual discourse
 

211
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,029
the quality of intellectual discourse
well I think you can you could think of

212
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:36,039
well I think you can you could think of
 

213
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,710
well I think you can you could think of
it you know if you were to slow it down

214
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
it you know if you were to slow it down
 

215
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,469
it you know if you were to slow it down
communication How would how you feel

216
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:42,479
communication How would how you feel
 

217
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,830
communication How would how you feel
about that you know if you'd only talk

218
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:44,840
about that you know if you'd only talk
 

219
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,749
about that you know if you'd only talk
at let's say 1110th of normal speed you

220
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
at let's say 1110th of normal speed you
 

221
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,230
at let's say 1110th of normal speed you
would be like wow that's agonizingly

222
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,240
would be like wow that's agonizingly
 

223
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,070
would be like wow that's agonizingly
slow yeah uh so now imagine you could

224
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080
slow yeah uh so now imagine you could
 

225
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,990
slow yeah uh so now imagine you could
speak at communicate clearly um at 10 or

226
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
speak at communicate clearly um at 10 or
 

227
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,870
speak at communicate clearly um at 10 or
100 or a thousand times faster the

228
00:04:59,870 --> 00:04:59,880
100 or a thousand times faster the
 

229
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,310
100 or a thousand times faster the
normal listen uh I'm pretty sure nobody

230
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
normal listen uh I'm pretty sure nobody
 

231
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,749
normal listen uh I'm pretty sure nobody
in their right mind listens to me at 1X

232
00:05:06,749 --> 00:05:06,759
in their right mind listens to me at 1X
 

233
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,990
in their right mind listens to me at 1X
they listen at 2x so I I can only

234
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
they listen at 2x so I I can only
 

235
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,790
they listen at 2x so I I can only
imagine what 10x would feel like or I

236
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
imagine what 10x would feel like or I
 

237
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,230
imagine what 10x would feel like or I
could actually understand it I usually

238
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
could actually understand it I usually
 

239
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,670
could actually understand it I usually
default to 1.5x um you can do 2x but

240
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
default to 1.5x um you can do 2x but
 

241
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,150
default to 1.5x um you can do 2x but
well actually if I'm trying to go if I'm

242
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,160
well actually if I'm trying to go if I'm
 

243
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,390
well actually if I'm trying to go if I'm
listening somebody to go to in like sort

244
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:21,400
listening somebody to go to in like sort
 

245
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,309
listening somebody to go to in like sort
of 15 20 minute segments to go to sleep

246
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:23,319
of 15 20 minute segments to go to sleep
 

247
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,510
of 15 20 minute segments to go to sleep
then I'll do it 1.5x um if I'm paying

248
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:26,520
then I'll do it 1.5x um if I'm paying
 

249
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,469
then I'll do it 1.5x um if I'm paying
attention I'll do 2X

250
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479

 

251
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,350

right um but actually if you start

252
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
right um but actually if you start
 

253
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,350
right um but actually if you start
actually listen to podcasts or or sort

254
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:36,360
actually listen to podcasts or or sort
 

255
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,950
actually listen to podcasts or or sort
of audiobooks or anything at if you get

256
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
of audiobooks or anything at if you get
 

257
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,510
of audiobooks or anything at if you get
used to doing it at 1.5 then then one

258
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
used to doing it at 1.5 then then one
 

259
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,150
used to doing it at 1.5 then then one
sounds painfully slow I'm still holding

260
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
sounds painfully slow I'm still holding
 

261
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,749
sounds painfully slow I'm still holding
on to one because I'm afraid I'm afraid

262
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:46,759
on to one because I'm afraid I'm afraid
 

263
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,909
on to one because I'm afraid I'm afraid
of myself becoming bored with the

264
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:48,919
of myself becoming bored with the
 

265
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,350
of myself becoming bored with the
reality with the real world where

266
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,360
reality with the real world where
 

267
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,749
reality with the real world where
everyone's speaking in One

268
00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:52,759
everyone's speaking in One
 

269
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,749
everyone's speaking in One
X well it depends on the person you can

270
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:54,759
X well it depends on the person you can
 

271
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,029
X well it depends on the person you can
speak very fast like we we can

272
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:56,039
speak very fast like we we can
 

273
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,909
speak very fast like we we can
communicate very quickly and also if you

274
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
communicate very quickly and also if you
 

275
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,909
communicate very quickly and also if you
use a wide range of if you if your

276
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
use a wide range of if you if your
 

277
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,870
use a wide range of if you if your
vocabulary is larger your uh bit rate

278
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
vocabulary is larger your uh bit rate
 

279
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,070
vocabulary is larger your uh bit rate
effective bit rate is

280
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,080
effective bit rate is
 

281
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,749
effective bit rate is
higher that's a good way to put it yeah

282
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
higher that's a good way to put it yeah
 

283
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,589
higher that's a good way to put it yeah
the effective bit rate I mean that is

284
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:09,599
the effective bit rate I mean that is
 

285
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:11,350
the effective bit rate I mean that is
the question is how much information is

286
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
the question is how much information is
 

287
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,670
the question is how much information is
actually compressed in the low bit

288
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
actually compressed in the low bit
 

289
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,550
actually compressed in the low bit
transfer of language yeah if you if

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
transfer of language yeah if you if
 

291
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,629
transfer of language yeah if you if
there's if if there's a single word that

292
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
there's if if there's a single word that
 

293
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,629
there's if if there's a single word that
is able to convey something that would

or or a simple picture and of course

316
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:49,639
or or a simple picture and of course
 

317
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,990
or or a simple picture and of course
you're referring to memes broadly like

318
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
you're referring to memes broadly like
 

319
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,270
you're referring to memes broadly like
ideas yeah that's there's a an entire

320
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
ideas yeah that's there's a an entire
 

321
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,150
ideas yeah that's there's a an entire
idea structure that is like a an idea

322
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
idea structure that is like a an idea
 

323
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,710
idea structure that is like a an idea
template

324
00:06:59,710 --> 00:06:59,720
template
 

325
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,550
template
and then you can add something to that

326
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
and then you can add something to that
 

327
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,710
and then you can add something to that
idea template uh but somebody has that

328
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
idea template uh but somebody has that
 

329
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,990
idea template uh but somebody has that
pre-existing idea template in their head

330
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,000
pre-existing idea template in their head
 

331
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,510
pre-existing idea template in their head
um so when you add that incremental bit

332
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:08,520
um so when you add that incremental bit
 

333
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,550
um so when you add that incremental bit
of information you're conveying uh much

334
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
of information you're conveying uh much
 

335
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,430
of information you're conveying uh much
more than if you just you know said a

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,830
few words you it's everything associated
with that Meme you think there'll be

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
with that Meme you think there'll be
 

341
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,510
with that Meme you think there'll be
emergent leaps of capability as you

342
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
emergent leaps of capability as you
 

343
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,150
emergent leaps of capability as you
scale the number of electrodes like

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:19,160
scale the number of electrodes like
 

345
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,230
scale the number of electrodes like
there'll be a certain you think there'll

The Human Experience will be altered yes

350
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:27,720
The Human Experience will be altered yes
 

351
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,749
The Human Experience will be altered yes
what do you think that number might be

352
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:29,759
what do you think that number might be
 

353
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,790
what do you think that number might be
whether electrodes or BPS we of course

354
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
whether electrodes or BPS we of course
 

355
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,029
whether electrodes or BPS we of course
don't know for sure but is this 10,000

356
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:36,039
don't know for sure but is this 10,000
 

357
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,990
don't know for sure but is this 10,000
100,000 yeah I mean certainly if you're

358
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
100,000 yeah I mean certainly if you're
 

359
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,469
100,000 yeah I mean certainly if you're
anywhere at 10,000 PS per second I mean

360
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
anywhere at 10,000 PS per second I mean
 

361
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,070
anywhere at 10,000 PS per second I mean
that's vastly faster than any human

362
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
that's vastly faster than any human
 

363
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,350
that's vastly faster than any human
communicate right now if if you think of

364
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:44,360
communicate right now if if you think of
 

365
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,469
communicate right now if if you think of
the what is the average bits per second

366
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
the what is the average bits per second
 

367
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,070
the what is the average bits per second
of a human it is less than one bit per

368
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
of a human it is less than one bit per
 

369
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,029
of a human it is less than one bit per
second over the course of a day because

370
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:50,039
second over the course of a day because
 

371
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,830
second over the course of a day because
there are 86,400 seconds in a day and

372
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:52,840
there are 86,400 seconds in a day and
 

373
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,550
there are 86,400 seconds in a day and
you don't communicate

374
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
you don't communicate
 

375
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,550
you don't communicate
86,400 um tokens in a

376
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:57,560
86,400 um tokens in a
 

377
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,950
86,400 um tokens in a
day Therefore your best second is less

378
00:07:59,950 --> 00:07:59,960
day Therefore your best second is less
 

379
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,790
day Therefore your best second is less
than one average over 24 hours it's

380
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
than one average over 24 hours it's
 

381
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,309
than one average over 24 hours it's
quite slow um and now even if you're

382
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:05,319
quite slow um and now even if you're
 

383
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,390
quite slow um and now even if you're
communicating very quickly and and you

384
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400
communicating very quickly and and you
 

385
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,149
communicating very quickly and and you
you know you're uh talking to somebody

386
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:11,159
you know you're uh talking to somebody
 

387
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,990
you know you're uh talking to somebody
who understands what you're saying

388
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,000
who understands what you're saying
 

389
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,710
who understands what you're saying
because in order to communicate you have

390
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:15,720
because in order to communicate you have
 

391
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,790
because in order to communicate you have
to at least to some degree model the

392
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:17,800
to at least to some degree model the
 

393
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,309
to at least to some degree model the
Mind state of the person to whom you're

394
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:19,319
Mind state of the person to whom you're
 

395
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,029
Mind state of the person to whom you're
speaking U then take the concept you're

396
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:22,039
speaking U then take the concept you're
 

397
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,510
speaking U then take the concept you're
trying to convey compress that into a

398
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
trying to convey compress that into a
 

399
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,790
trying to convey compress that into a
small number of syllables speak them and

400
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:25,800
small number of syllables speak them and
 

401
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,830
small number of syllables speak them and
hope that the other person decompresses

402
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
hope that the other person decompresses
 

403
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,390
hope that the other person decompresses
them into uh a conceptual structure that

404
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:31,400
them into uh a conceptual structure that
 

405
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,670
them into uh a conceptual structure that
is as close to what you have in your

406
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:32,680
is as close to what you have in your
 

407
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,190
is as close to what you have in your
mind as possible yeah I mean there's a

408
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
mind as possible yeah I mean there's a
 

409
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,230
mind as possible yeah I mean there's a
lot of signal loss there in that process

410
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:37,240
lot of signal loss there in that process
 

411
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,310
lot of signal loss there in that process
yeah very lossy compression and

412
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,320
yeah very lossy compression and
 

413
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,750
yeah very lossy compression and
decompression and a lot of the um a lot

414
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:42,760
decompression and a lot of the um a lot
 

415
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,670
decompression and a lot of the um a lot
of what your neurons are doing is

416
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:44,680
of what your neurons are doing is
 

417
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,430
of what your neurons are doing is
distilling the concepts down to a small

418
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
distilling the concepts down to a small
 

419
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,829
distilling the concepts down to a small
number of symbols of say syllables that

420
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:50,839
number of symbols of say syllables that
 

421
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,190
number of symbols of say syllables that
I'm speaking or or key strokes whatever

422
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm speaking or or key strokes whatever
 

423
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,829
I'm speaking or or key strokes whatever
the case may be

424
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:54,839
the case may be
 

425
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,550
the case may be
so uh that that's a lot of what your

426
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
so uh that that's a lot of what your
 

427
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,509
so uh that that's a lot of what your
brain computation is doing now there is

428
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
brain computation is doing now there is
 

429
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,389
brain computation is doing now there is
an argument that that's

430
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:05,399

 

431
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,470

actually a healthy thing to do or

432
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:07,480
actually a healthy thing to do or
 

433
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,870
actually a healthy thing to do or
helpful thing to do

434
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:09,880
helpful thing to do
 

435
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,670
helpful thing to do
because as you try to compress complex

436
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:12,680
because as you try to compress complex
 

437
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,630
because as you try to compress complex
con Concepts you're perhaps forced to

438
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:14,640
con Concepts you're perhaps forced to
 

439
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,829
con Concepts you're perhaps forced to
distill the you know what is what is

440
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:16,839
distill the you know what is what is
 

441
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,350
distill the you know what is what is
most essential in those Concepts as

442
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,360
most essential in those Concepts as
 

443
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,670
most essential in those Concepts as
opposed to just all the fluff so in the

444
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
opposed to just all the fluff so in the
 

445
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,430
opposed to just all the fluff so in the
process of compression you just still

446
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
process of compression you just still
 

447
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,230
process of compression you just still
things down to what matters the most

448
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,240
things down to what matters the most
 

449
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,870
things down to what matters the most
because you can only say a few things so

450
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:27,880
because you can only say a few things so
 

451
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,190
because you can only say a few things so
that is perhaps helpful I think we might

452
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:30,200
that is perhaps helpful I think we might
 

453
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,630
that is perhaps helpful I think we might
we'll probably get if our data rate

454
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
we'll probably get if our data rate
 

455
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,710
we'll probably get if our data rate
increases the it's highly probable that

456
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
increases the it's highly probable that
 

457
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,750
increases the it's highly probable that
we'll become far more

458
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:36,760
we'll become far more
 

459
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,509
we'll become far more
verbose um just like your computer you

460
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
verbose um just like your computer you
 

461
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,790
verbose um just like your computer you
know when computers had like my my first

462
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
know when computers had like my my first
 

463
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,750
know when computers had like my my first
computer had 8K of ram you know so um

464
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
computer had 8K of ram you know so um
 

465
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,509
computer had 8K of ram you know so um
you really thought about every bite and

466
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:48,519
you really thought about every bite and
 

467
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,550
you really thought about every bite and
um you know now you got computers with

468
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:51,560
um you know now you got computers with
 

469
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,870
um you know now you got computers with
many gigabytes of RAM so you know if you

470
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
many gigabytes of RAM so you know if you
 

471
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,389
many gigabytes of RAM so you know if you

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,440
consider
 

497
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,710
consider
that the AI is simply going to get bored

Woods I mean if the AI can communicate

502
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:37,720
Woods I mean if the AI can communicate
 

503
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,629
Woods I mean if the AI can communicate
at terabits per second and you're

504
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:39,639
at terabits per second and you're
 

505
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,350
at terabits per second and you're
communicating at you know bits per

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:42,360
communicating at you know bits per
 

507
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,110
communicating at you know bits per
second it's like talk to a tree well it

508
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,120
second it's like talk to a tree well it
 

509
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,990
second it's like talk to a tree well it
is a very interesting question for a

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,030
is a very interesting question for a
super intelligent species what use are

00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
super intelligent species what use are
 

513
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,190
super intelligent species what use are
humans um I think there is some argument

514
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,200
humans um I think there is some argument
 

515
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,870
humans um I think there is some argument
for humans as a source of will

516
00:10:59,870 --> 00:10:59,880
for humans as a source of will
 

517
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,710
for humans as a source of will
will will yeah source of will or

518
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
will will yeah source of will or
 

519
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,550
will will yeah source of will or
purpose so if if you consider

520
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:05,560
purpose so if if you consider
 

521
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,470
purpose so if if you consider
the the human mind as being essentially

522
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,480
the the human mind as being essentially
 

523
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,949
the the human mind as being essentially
the there the Primitive lmic Elements

00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
the there the Primitive lmic Elements
 

525
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,910
the there the Primitive lmic Elements
which basically even like reptiles have

526
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
which basically even like reptiles have
 

527
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,870
which basically even like reptiles have
and there's the cortex the thinking and

528
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:17,880
and there's the cortex the thinking and
 

529
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,150
and there's the cortex the thinking and
planning part of the brain now the

530
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
planning part of the brain now the
 

531
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,590
planning part of the brain now the

00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,240
system happy I mean the sheer amount of
 

539
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,509
system happy I mean the sheer amount of

compute that's gone into people trying
 

541
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,670
compute that's gone into people trying
to get laid is insane um without the

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
to get laid is insane um without the
 

543
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,910

actually seeking procreation they're

546
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
actually seeking procreation they're
 

547
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,829
actually seeking procreation they're
just literally trying to do this sort of

548
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:38,839
just literally trying to do this sort of
 

549
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:41,230
just literally trying to do this sort of
simple motion

550
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,240
simple motion
 

551
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,990
simple motion
um and they get a kick out of it yeah so

552
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,000
um and they get a kick out of it yeah so
 

553
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,310
um and they get a kick out of it yeah so
this uh Syle which in the abstract

554
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:47,320
this uh Syle which in the abstract
 

555
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,710
this uh Syle which in the abstract
rather absurd motion which is sex uh the

556
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
rather absurd motion which is sex uh the
 

557
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,509
rather absurd motion which is sex uh the

compute into trying to figure out how to
 

561
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,069
compute into trying to figure out how to
do that so like 90% of distributed

562
00:11:57,069 --> 00:11:57,079
do that so like 90% of distributed
 

563
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:58,629
do that so like 90% of distributed
computer of the human species is spent

on trying to get late probably like

566
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:00,519
on trying to get late probably like
 

567
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,069
on trying to get late probably like
large yeah yeah there's no purpose to

568
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:03,079
large yeah yeah there's no purpose to
 

569
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,829
large yeah yeah there's no purpose to
most sex except uh hedonistic you know

570
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:06,839
most sex except uh hedonistic you know
 

571
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,110
most sex except uh hedonistic you know
it's just sort of Joy or whatever DOP

572
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
it's just sort of Joy or whatever DOP
 

573
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,509
it's just sort of Joy or whatever DOP
mean release um now what once in a while

574
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
mean release um now what once in a while
 

575
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,069
mean release um now what once in a while
it's procreation but for humans it's

576
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:15,079
it's procreation but for humans it's
 

577
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,069
it's procreation but for humans it's
mostly modern humans is mostly uh

578
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
mostly modern humans is mostly uh
 

579
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,189
mostly modern humans is mostly uh
recreational um and uh and so so so your

580
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:23,199
recreational um and uh and so so so your
 

581
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:24,389
recreational um and uh and so so so your
cortex much smarter than your lmic

582
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:24,399
cortex much smarter than your lmic
 

583
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,629
cortex much smarter than your lmic
system is trying to make a lmic system

584
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:25,639
system is trying to make a lmic system
 

585
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,910
system is trying to make a lmic system
happy because LMP system wants to have

586
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:26,920
happy because LMP system wants to have
 

587
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,069
happy because LMP system wants to have
sex so um or want some tasty food or

588
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
sex so um or want some tasty food or
 

589
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,509
sex so um or want some tasty food or
whatever the case may be and then that

590
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:32,519
whatever the case may be and then that
 

591
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,790
whatever the case may be and then that
that is then further augmented by the

592
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:33,800
that is then further augmented by the
 

593
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,230
that is then further augmented by the
tertiary system which is your phone your

Computing stuff that's your tertiary
 

599
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,470
Computing stuff that's your tertiary
layer so you're actually already a

600
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
layer so you're actually already a
 

601
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,710
layer so you're actually already a
cyborg uh you have this tertiary compute

602
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
cyborg uh you have this tertiary compute
 

603
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,870
cyborg uh you have this tertiary compute
layer which is in the form of your your

604
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
layer which is in the form of your your
 

605
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,870

606
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
computer with all the applications all
 

607
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,389
computer with all the applications all
your computer devices um and uh and so

608
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
your computer devices um and uh and so
 

609
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,509
your computer devices um and uh and so
in the getting laad front there's

610
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
in the getting laad front there's
 

611
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,150
in the getting laad front there's
actually a massive amount of comp of

612
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
actually a massive amount of comp of
 

613
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,990
actually a massive amount of comp of
digital compute also trying to get

614
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:01,000
digital compute also trying to get
 

615
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,150
digital compute also trying to get
late you know with like Tinder and

616
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,160
late you know with like Tinder and
 

617
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,670
late you know with like Tinder and
whatever you know yeah so the compute

618
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:05,680
whatever you know yeah so the compute
 

619
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,389
whatever you know yeah so the compute
that we humans have built is also

620
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
that we humans have built is also
 

621
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,949
that we humans have built is also
participating yeah I mean there's like

622
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
participating yeah I mean there's like
 

623
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,310
participating yeah I mean there's like
gws of compute going into getting late

624
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:13,320
gws of compute going into getting late
 

625
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,750
gws of compute going into getting late
of digital compute

626
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
of digital compute
 

627
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,230
of digital compute
yeah what if AGI was this is happening

628
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
yeah what if AGI was this is happening
 

629
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,990
yeah what if AGI was this is happening
as we speak if we merge with AI is just

630
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,000
as we speak if we merge with AI is just
 

631
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,230
as we speak if we merge with AI is just
going to expand the compute that we

632
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,240
going to expand the compute that we
 

633
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,670
going to expand the compute that we
humans use pretty much to try just one

634
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
humans use pretty much to try just one
 

635
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,350
humans use pretty much to try just one
of the things certainly yeah yeah um but

636
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
of the things certainly yeah yeah um but
 

637
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,870
of the things certainly yeah yeah um but
what I'm saying is that that yes like

638
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
what I'm saying is that that yes like
 

639
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,550
what I'm saying is that that yes like
what's is there a use for humans

640
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
what's is there a use for humans
 

641
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,470
what's is there a use for humans
um well there's this fundamental

642
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
um well there's this fundamental
 

643
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,629
um well there's this fundamental
question of what's meaning of life why

644
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:37,639
question of what's meaning of life why
 

645
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:42,030
question of what's meaning of life why
do anything at all um and so if if if

646
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,040
do anything at all um and so if if if
 

647
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,230
do anything at all um and so if if if
our simple Olympic system provides a

648
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
our simple Olympic system provides a
 

649
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,590
our simple Olympic system provides a
source of will to do something um that

650
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,600
source of will to do something um that
 

651
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,470
source of will to do something um that
then goes to our cortex that then goes

652
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:49,480
then goes to our cortex that then goes
 

653
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,629
then goes to our cortex that then goes
to our you know tertiary compute layer

654
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:53,639
to our you know tertiary compute layer
 

655
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,189
to our you know tertiary compute layer
then you know I don't know it might

656
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:56,199
then you know I don't know it might
 

657
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,550
then you know I don't know it might
actually be that the AI in a b simply

658
00:13:59,550 --> 00:13:59,560
actually be that the AI in a b simply
 

659
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,790
actually be that the AI in a b simply
trying to make the human lmic system

660
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
trying to make the human lmic system
 

661
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,870
trying to make the human lmic system
happy yeah it seems like it's the will

662
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:05,880
happy yeah it seems like it's the will
 

663
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,470
happy yeah it seems like it's the will
is not just about the limic system

664
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:07,480
is not just about the limic system
 

665
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,910
is not just about the limic system
there's a lot of interesting complicated

666
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:08,920
there's a lot of interesting complicated
 

667
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,509
there's a lot of interesting complicated
things in there we we also want Power

668
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
things in there we we also want Power
 

669
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,550
things in there we we also want Power
that's limic too I think but then we

670
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:13,560
that's limic too I think but then we
 

671
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,670
that's limic too I think but then we
also want to in a kind of Cooperative

672
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
also want to in a kind of Cooperative
 

673
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,790
also want to in a kind of Cooperative
way alleviate the suffering in the world

674
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
way alleviate the suffering in the world
 

675
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,310
way alleviate the suffering in the world
uh not everybody does but yeah sure some

676
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:21,320
uh not everybody does but yeah sure some
 

677
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,949
uh not everybody does but yeah sure some
people do as a group of humans when we

678
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:23,959
people do as a group of humans when we
 

679
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:26,749
people do as a group of humans when we
get together we start to have this kind

680
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:26,759
get together we start to have this kind
 

681
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:29,990
get together we start to have this kind
of collective intelligence that is

682
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
of collective intelligence that is
 

683
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,910
of collective intelligence that is
uh is more complex in its will than the

684
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:33,920
uh is more complex in its will than the
 

685
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,389
uh is more complex in its will than the
underlying individual descendants of

686
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
underlying individual descendants of
 

687
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,790
underlying individual descendants of
Apes right so there's like other

688
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
Apes right so there's like other
 

689
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,870
Apes right so there's like other
motivations and that could be a really

690
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:40,880
motivations and that could be a really
 

691
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,030
motivations and that could be a really
interesting source of uh an objective

692
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,040
interesting source of uh an objective
 

693
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,829
interesting source of uh an objective
function for AGI yeah um I mean there's

694
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
function for AGI yeah um I mean there's
 

695
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,829
function for AGI yeah um I mean there's
there are these uh sort fairly

696
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:51,839
there are these uh sort fairly
 

697
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,949
there are these uh sort fairly
cerebral or kind of higher level goals I

698
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
cerebral or kind of higher level goals I
 

699
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,310
cerebral or kind of higher level goals I
mean for me it's like what's the meaning

700
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
mean for me it's like what's the meaning
 

701
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,189
mean for me it's like what's the meaning
of life or understanding understanding

702
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:58,199
of life or understanding understanding
 

703
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,910
of life or understanding understanding
the nature of the universe

704
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
the nature of the universe
 

705
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,509
the nature of the universe
is a of great interest to me um and uh

706
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
is a of great interest to me um and uh
 

707
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,470
is a of great interest to me um and uh
hopefully to the AI and that's the

708
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:09,480
hopefully to the AI and that's the
 

709
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,949
hopefully to the AI and that's the
that's the mission of xai and Gro is

710
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:11,959
that's the mission of xai and Gro is
 

711
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:14,389
that's the mission of xai and Gro is
understand the universe so do you think

712
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
understand the universe so do you think
 

713
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,030
understand the universe so do you think
people when you have a neural link with

channels most of the use cases will be
 

719
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,550
channels most of the use cases will be
communication with AI

720
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560

 

721
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,949

systems well if assuming that the

722
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
systems well if assuming that the
 

723
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,030
systems well if assuming that the
they're not um I mean there this solving

724
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,040
they're not um I mean there this solving
 

725
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,550
they're not um I mean there this solving
basic

726
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:35,560
basic
 

727
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,069
basic
uh neurological issues that people have

728
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:39,079
uh neurological issues that people have
 

729
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,189
uh neurological issues that people have
you know if they've got um damaged

730
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:42,199
you know if they've got um damaged
 

731
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:44,230
you know if they've got um damaged
neurons in their spinal cord or neck or

732
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,240
neurons in their spinal cord or neck or
 

733
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,350
neurons in their spinal cord or neck or
you know um as as is the case with our

734
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
you know um as as is the case with our
 

735
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,710
you know um as as is the case with our
first two patients then you know this

736
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:49,720
first two patients then you know this
 

737
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,949
first two patients then you know this
obviously the first order business is

738
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:51,959
obviously the first order business is
 

739
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,470
obviously the first order business is
solving fundamental neuron damage in the

740
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:55,480
solving fundamental neuron damage in the
 

741
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,189
solving fundamental neuron damage in the
spinal cord neck or in the brain itself

742
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
spinal cord neck or in the brain itself
 

743
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,389
spinal cord neck or in the brain itself
um

744
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
um
 

745
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,470
um
so you know our second um product is

746
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:05,480
so you know our second um product is
 

747
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,350
so you know our second um product is
called Blindside which is to enable

748
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
called Blindside which is to enable
 

749
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,470
called Blindside which is to enable
people who are completely blind less

750
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:09,480
people who are completely blind less
 

751
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,670
people who are completely blind less
both eyes or Optic nove or just can't

752
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
both eyes or Optic nove or just can't
 

753
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,790
both eyes or Optic nove or just can't
see at all uh to be able to see um by

754
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:14,800
see at all uh to be able to see um by
 

755
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,629
see at all uh to be able to see um by
directly triggering the neurons in the

756
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
directly triggering the neurons in the
 

757
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,150
directly triggering the neurons in the
visual cortex so we're just starting at

758
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,160
visual cortex so we're just starting at
 

759
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,189
visual cortex so we're just starting at
the basics here you know this is like um

760
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:22,199
the basics here you know this is like um
 

761
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,389
the basics here you know this is like um
very the the simple stuff uh relatively

762
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:25,399
very the the simple stuff uh relatively
 

763
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,230
very the the simple stuff uh relatively
speaking is solving

764
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:29,240
speaking is solving
 

765
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,790
speaking is solving
um neuron damage um you it can also

766
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
um neuron damage um you it can also
 

767
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,949
um neuron damage um you it can also
solve uh I think probably schizophrenia

768
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:35,959
solve uh I think probably schizophrenia
 

769
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,590
solve uh I think probably schizophrenia
you know uh if people have seizures of

770
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
you know uh if people have seizures of
 

771
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,350
you know uh if people have seizures of
some kind probably solve that um it

772
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:42,360
some kind probably solve that um it
 

773
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,030
some kind probably solve that um it
could help with

774
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,040
could help with
 

775
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,629
could help with
memory there there so there's like a

776
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
memory there there so there's like a
 

777
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,030
memory there there so there's like a
kind of a a tech tree if you will of

778
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,040
kind of a a tech tree if you will of
 

779
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,350
kind of a a tech tree if you will of
like you got the

780
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
like you got the
 

781
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,590
like you got the
basics um like like you need you need

782
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:54,600
basics um like like you need you need
 

783
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,949
basics um like like you need you need
literacy before you can have you know

784
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959

790
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:04,039
know got it do you have letters an
 

791
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:07,029
know got it do you have letters an
alphabet okay great uh words you know

792
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
alphabet okay great uh words you know
 

793
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,789
alphabet okay great uh words you know
then eventually get sagas

794
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
then eventually get sagas
 

795
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,909
then eventually get sagas
so you know I think there's there may be

796
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
so you know I think there's there may be
 

797
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,429
so you know I think there's there may be
some you know things to worry about in

798
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:16,439
some you know things to worry about in
 

799
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:18,990
some you know things to worry about in
in the future but the first several

800
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,000
in the future but the first several
 

801
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,829
in the future but the first several
years are really just solving basic

802
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:20,839
years are really just solving basic
 

803
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,270
years are really just solving basic
neurological damage like for people who

804
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
neurological damage like for people who
 

805
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,990
neurological damage like for people who
have essentially complete or near

806
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:25,000
have essentially complete or near
 

807
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,949
have essentially complete or near
complete loss of from the brain to the

808
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:27,959
complete loss of from the brain to the
 

809
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,990
complete loss of from the brain to the
body um like Stephen hauling would be an

810
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,000
body um like Stephen hauling would be an
 

811
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,669
body um like Stephen hauling would be an
example uh the neuralink would be

812
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
example uh the neuralink would be
 

813
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,750
example uh the neuralink would be
incredibly profound because I mean you

814
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
incredibly profound because I mean you
 

815
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,390
incredibly profound because I mean you
can imagine if Stephen Hawking could

816
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:37,400
can imagine if Stephen Hawking could
 

817
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,590
can imagine if Stephen Hawking could
communicate as fast as we're

818
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:38,600
communicate as fast as we're
 

819
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,390
communicate as fast as we're
communicating perhaps faster um and

820
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:41,400
communicating perhaps faster um and
 

821
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,549
communicating perhaps faster um and
that's certainly uh possible probable in

822
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
that's certainly uh possible probable in
 

823
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,310
that's certainly uh possible probable in
fact likely I'd say so there's uh a kind

824
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
fact likely I'd say so there's uh a kind
 

825
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,270
fact likely I'd say so there's uh a kind
of dual track of medical and non-medical

826
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
of dual track of medical and non-medical
 

827
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,390
of dual track of medical and non-medical
meaning so everything you've talked

828
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:53,400
meaning so everything you've talked
 

829
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,230
meaning so everything you've talked
about could be applied to people who are

830
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:56,240
about could be applied to people who are
 

831
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,549
about could be applied to people who are
non-disabled in the future the logical

832
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
non-disabled in the future the logical
 

833
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,430
non-disabled in the future the logical
thing to to do is sensible things to do

834
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:00,440
thing to to do is sensible things to do
 

835
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,510
thing to to do is sensible things to do
is to start off

836
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:02,520
is to start off
 

837
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,110
is to start off
solving

838
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,120
solving
 

839
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:11,070
solving
um basic uh neuron damage issues yes um

840
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,080
um basic uh neuron damage issues yes um
 

841
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,510
um basic uh neuron damage issues yes um
because the there's obviously some risk

842
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
because the there's obviously some risk
 

843
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,549
because the there's obviously some risk
with with the new device is you can't

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:15,559
with with the new device is you can't
 

845
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,470
with with the new device is you can't
get the risk down at zero um it's not

846
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:17,480
get the risk down at zero um it's not
 

847
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,110
get the risk down at zero um it's not
possible so you want to have um the

848
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,120
possible so you want to have um the
 

849
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,909
possible so you want to have um the
highest possible reward given that given

850
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:22,919
highest possible reward given that given
 

851
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,350
highest possible reward given that given
there's a certain irreducible risk and

852
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
there's a certain irreducible risk and
 

853
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,950
there's a certain irreducible risk and
if um if somebody's able to have a Prof

854
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:28,960
if um if somebody's able to have a Prof
 

855
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,470
if um if somebody's able to have a Prof
Improvement in their

856
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
Improvement in their
 

857
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,270
Improvement in their
communication

858
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:32,280
communication
 

859
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,510
communication
um that's worth the risk as you get the

860
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
um that's worth the risk as you get the
 

861
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,149
um that's worth the risk as you get the
the risk down yeah as you get the risk

862
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:37,159
the risk down yeah as you get the risk
 

863
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,750
the risk down yeah as you get the risk
down once the risk is is down to to you

864
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
down once the risk is is down to to you
 

865
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,830
down once the risk is is down to to you
know if you have like thousands of of

866
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:42,840
know if you have like thousands of of
 

867
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,909
know if you have like thousands of of
people that have been using it for for

868
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:44,919
people that have been using it for for
 

869
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:48,070
people that have been using it for for
years and the risk is minimal then um

870
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
years and the risk is minimal then um
 

871
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,430
years and the risk is minimal then um
perhaps at that point you could consider

872
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:49,440
perhaps at that point you could consider
 

873
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,029
perhaps at that point you could consider
saying okay let's let's aim for

874
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:52,039
saying okay let's let's aim for
 

875
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:55,270
saying okay let's let's aim for
augmentation now now I think we we we're

876
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
augmentation now now I think we we we're
 

877
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,029
augmentation now now I think we we we're
actually going to aim for augmentation

878
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
actually going to aim for augmentation
 

879
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,029
actually going to aim for augmentation
with people who have neur neuron damage

880
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
with people who have neur neuron damage
 

881
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,590
with people who have neur neuron damage
so we're not just aiming to give people

882
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:01,600
so we're not just aiming to give people
 

883
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,350
so we're not just aiming to give people
a communication data rate equivalent to

884
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:04,360
a communication data rate equivalent to
 

885
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,070
a communication data rate equivalent to
normal humans we're aiming to give

886
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
normal humans we're aiming to give
 

887
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,390
normal humans we're aiming to give
people who have you know quadriplegic or

888
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:09,400
people who have you know quadriplegic or
 

889
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,669
people who have you know quadriplegic or
maybe have complete loss um of the

890
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
maybe have complete loss um of the
 

891
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,110
maybe have complete loss um of the
connection to the brain and body a

892
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:14,120
connection to the brain and body a
 

893
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,070
connection to the brain and body a
communication data rate that exceeds

894
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
communication data rate that exceeds
 

895
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,950
communication data rate that exceeds
normal humans I mean well we're in there

896
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:17,960
normal humans I mean well we're in there
 

897
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,830
normal humans I mean well we're in there
why not let's give people

898
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
why not let's give people
 

899
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,110
why not let's give people
superpowers and the same for vision as

900
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,120
superpowers and the same for vision as
 

901
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,510
superpowers and the same for vision as
you restore Vision that could be aspects

902
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:24,520
you restore Vision that could be aspects
 

903
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,310
you restore Vision that could be aspects
of that restoration that are superum

904
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:27,320
of that restoration that are superum
 

905
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,149
of that restoration that are superum
yeah at at first the vision restoration

906
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:29,159
yeah at at first the vision restoration
 

907
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,630
yeah at at first the vision restoration
will be uh low res um because you have

908
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:32,640
will be uh low res um because you have
 

909
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,830
will be uh low res um because you have
to say like how many neurons can you put

910
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:34,840
to say like how many neurons can you put
 

911
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,549
to say like how many neurons can you put
in there and and Trigger and and you can

912
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:37,559
in there and and Trigger and and you can
 

913
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,590
in there and and Trigger and and you can
do things where you you um adjust the

914
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
do things where you you um adjust the
 

915
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,310
do things where you you um adjust the
electric field so like even if you've

916
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,320
electric field so like even if you've
 

917
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,470
electric field so like even if you've
got say 10,000 neurons it's not just

918
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
got say 10,000 neurons it's not just
 

919
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,830
got say 10,000 neurons it's not just
10,000 pixels because you can adjust the

920
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
10,000 pixels because you can adjust the
 

921
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,270
10,000 pixels because you can adjust the
the field between the the neurons and do

922
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,280
the field between the the neurons and do
 

923
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,590
the field between the the neurons and do
them in patterns in order to get say I

924
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
them in patterns in order to get say I
 

925
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,549
them in patterns in order to get say I
have say 10,000 electrodes effectively

926
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:55,559
have say 10,000 electrodes effectively
 

927
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,110
have say 10,000 electrodes effectively
give you uh I don't know maybe

928
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:00,120
give you uh I don't know maybe
 

929
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,470
give you uh I don't know maybe
like having a a megapixel or a 10

930
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
like having a a megapixel or a 10
 

931
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,669
like having a a megapixel or a 10
megapixel

932
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
megapixel
 

933
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,149
megapixel
situation um so and then o over time I

934
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
situation um so and then o over time I
 

935
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,830
situation um so and then o over time I
think you get to higher resolution than

936
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:10,840
think you get to higher resolution than
 

937
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,310
think you get to higher resolution than
human eyes and you could also see in

938
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:12,320
human eyes and you could also see in
 

939
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,830
human eyes and you could also see in
different wavelengths so like Jord Le

940
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:14,840
different wavelengths so like Jord Le
 

941
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,830
different wavelengths so like Jord Le
flge from Star Trek you know like the

942
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
flge from Star Trek you know like the
 

943
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,110
flge from Star Trek you know like the
thing you can just if you want to see in

944
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,120
thing you can just if you want to see in
 

945
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,390
thing you can just if you want to see in
radar no problem you can see ultraviolet

946
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
radar no problem you can see ultraviolet
 

947
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,630
radar no problem you can see ultraviolet

1103
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,430
solar system to see our galaxy and I saw
th that light that glow all across the

Intergalactic yeah but always pointing

1114
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:57,720
Intergalactic yeah but always pointing
 

1115

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:05,480
galaxies Intergalactic and all of it was
 

1121
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,750
galaxies Intergalactic and all of it was
glowing so but I couldn't control that

1122
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
glowing so but I couldn't control that
 

1123
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,310
glowing so but I couldn't control that
travel cuz I would actually explore near

1124
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
travel cuz I would actually explore near
 

1125
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,230
travel cuz I would actually explore near
distances to the solar system see if

1126
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:12,240
distances to the solar system see if
 

1127
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,669
distances to the solar system see if
there's aliens or any of that kind of

1128
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
there's aliens or any of that kind of
 

1129
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,310
there's aliens or any of that kind of
stuff no I didn't I didn't know Z aliens

1130
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
stuff no I didn't I didn't know Z aliens
 

1131
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,950
stuff no I didn't I didn't know Z aliens
implication of aliens because they were

1132
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:17,960
implication of aliens because they were
 

1133
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,510
implication of aliens because they were
glowing they were glowing in the same

1134
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
glowing they were glowing in the same
 

1135
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,950
glowing they were glowing in the same
way that humans were glowing that uh

1136
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:21,960
way that humans were glowing that uh
 

1137
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,430
way that humans were glowing that uh
that like life force that I was seeing

1138
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:24,440
that like life force that I was seeing
 

1139
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,710
that like life force that I was seeing
the the thing that made humans amazing

1140
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:27,720
the the thing that made humans amazing
 

1141

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:28,720
was there through throughout the
 

1143
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,950
was there through throughout the
Universe like there was these glowing

Universe like there was these glowing
 

1145
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,190
Universe like there was these glowing
dots so I don't know it made me feel

1146
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
dots so I don't know it made me feel
 

1147
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,269
dots so I don't know it made me feel
like there's life no not life but

1148
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:38,279
like there's life no not life but
 

1149
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:40,190
like there's life no not life but
something whatever makes humans amazing

1150
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:40,200
something whatever makes humans amazing
 

1151
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,510
something whatever makes humans amazing
all throughout the Universe sounds good

1152
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:42,520
all throughout the Universe sounds good
 

1153
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,590
all throughout the Universe sounds good
yeah it was amazing no demons no demons

1173
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,310
weren't very friendly they were very big
so the thing is about giant trees at

1174
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:07,320
so the thing is about giant trees at
 

1175
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,470
so the thing is about giant trees at
night which is where where I was I mean

1176

night which is where where I was I mean
 

1177
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,430
night which is where where I was I mean

1178
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
the jungle's kind of scary yeah the
 

1179
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,549
the jungle's kind of scary yeah the
trees started to look like dragons and

1180
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:13,559
trees started to look like dragons and
 

1181
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,750
trees started to look like dragons and
they were all like looking at me sure

1191
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,269
didn't speak in English by the way which
made it even scarier because we're not

1192
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:26,279
made it even scarier because we're not
 

1193
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,029
made it even scarier because we're not
even like you know where world's apart

1194
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:29,039
even like you know where world's apart
 

1195
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,310
even like you know where world's apart
in many ways it just

1196
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:31,320
in many ways it just
 

1197
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,230
in many ways it just
uh uh but yeah there was not they they

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
uh uh but yeah there was not they they
 

1199
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,909
uh uh but yeah there was not they they
talk about the mother of the forest

1200
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:36,919
talk about the mother of the forest
 

1201
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:38,830
talk about the mother of the forest
protecting you and that's what I felt

1202
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:38,840
protecting you and that's what I felt
 

1203
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,389
protecting you and that's what I felt
like and you're way out in the jungle

1204
00:25:40,389 --> 00:25:40,399
like and you're way out in the jungle
 

1205
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:43,310
like and you're way out in the jungle
way out there this is not like uh a

1206
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,320
way out there this is not like uh a
 

1207
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,470
way out there this is not like uh a
tourist Retreat you know like like like

1208
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:45,480
tourist Retreat you know like like like
 

1209
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,310
tourist Retreat you know like like like
10 miles outside of a foo or something

1210
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:47,320
10 miles outside of a foo or something
 

1211
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,710
10 miles outside of a foo or something
no we

1212
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
no we
 

1213
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,909
no we
went no this is not AEP Amazon so me and

1214
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:52,919
went no this is not AEP Amazon so me and
 

1215
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,909
went no this is not AEP Amazon so me and
this guy named Paul rosley who basically

1216
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:54,919
this guy named Paul rosley who basically
 

1217
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,870
this guy named Paul rosley who basically
is uh Tarzan he lives in the jungle we

1218
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:57,880
is uh Tarzan he lives in the jungle we
 

1219
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,350
is uh Tarzan he lives in the jungle we
went on deep and we just went crazy wow

1220
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,360
went on deep and we just went crazy wow
 

1221
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,110
went on deep and we just went crazy wow
cool yeah so anyway can I can I get that

1222
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
cool yeah so anyway can I can I get that
 

1223
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,190
cool yeah so anyway can I can I get that
same experience in a neur link probably

1224
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
same experience in a neur link probably
 

1225
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,870
same experience in a neur link probably
yeah I guess that is the question for uh

1226
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:07,880
yeah I guess that is the question for uh
 

1227
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,549
yeah I guess that is the question for uh
non-disabled people do you think that

1228
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:09,559
non-disabled people do you think that
 

1229
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,710
non-disabled people do you think that
there's a

1230
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:10,720
there's a
 

1231
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,710
there's a
lot in our perception in our experience

1232
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:13,720
lot in our perception in our experience
 

1233
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,430
lot in our perception in our experience
of the world that could be uh explored

1234
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:16,440
of the world that could be uh explored
 

1235
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,549
of the world that could be uh explored
that could be played with using New Link

1236
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559
that could be played with using New Link
 

1237
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,789
that could be played with using New Link
yeah I mean new link is it's really a

1238
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
yeah I mean new link is it's really a
 

1239
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,350
yeah I mean new link is it's really a
generalized um input output device you

1240
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,360
generalized um input output device you
 

1241
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,909
generalized um input output device you
know it's just it's a reading electrical

1242
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:28,919
know it's just it's a reading electrical
 

1243
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,870
know it's just it's a reading electrical
signals and generating electrical

1244
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
signals and generating electrical
 

1245
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,110
signals and generating electrical
signals and um I mean everything that

1246
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,120
signals and um I mean everything that
 

1247
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,029
signals and um I mean everything that
you've ever experienced in your whole

1248
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:36,039
you've ever experienced in your whole
 

1249
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:39,310
you've ever experienced in your whole
life smell you know emotions all of

1250
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,320
life smell you know emotions all of
 

1251
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,350
life smell you know emotions all of
those are electrical signals

1252
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,360
those are electrical signals
 

1253
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,029
those are electrical signals
so it's kind of weird to think that this

1254
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
so it's kind of weird to think that this
 

1255
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,470
so it's kind of weird to think that this
that your entire life experience is

1256
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
that your entire life experience is
 

1257
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,990
that your entire life experience is
distilled down to electrical signals

1258
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
distilled down to electrical signals
 

1259
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,710
distilled down to electrical signals
from neurons but that is in fact the

1260
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:49,720
from neurons but that is in fact the
 

1261
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,669
from neurons but that is in fact the
case um or I mean if that's at least

1262
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:52,679
case um or I mean if that's at least
 

1263
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,190
case um or I mean if that's at least
what all the evidence points to so I

1264
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,200
what all the evidence points to so I
 

1265
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,549
what all the evidence points to so I
mean

1266
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
mean
 

1267
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,389
mean
you you could you you trigger the right

1268
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:00,399
you you could you you trigger the right
 

1269
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:01,909
you you could you you trigger the right
neuron you could trigger a particular

1270
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
neuron you could trigger a particular
 

1271
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,990
neuron you could trigger a particular
scent you could um you could certainly

1272
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,000
scent you could um you could certainly
 

1273
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,789
scent you could um you could certainly
make things glow I mean do pretty much

1274
00:27:07,789 --> 00:27:07,799
make things glow I mean do pretty much
 

1275
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,830
make things glow I mean do pretty much
anything I mean really you could you can

1276
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
anything I mean really you could you can
 

1277
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,269
anything I mean really you could you can
think of the brain as a biological

1278
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:11,279
think of the brain as a biological
 

1279
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,950
think of the brain as a biological
computer so if there are certain say

1280
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:13,960
computer so if there are certain say
 

1281
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,870
computer so if there are certain say
chips or elements of that biological

1282
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:15,880
chips or elements of that biological
 

1283
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,430
chips or elements of that biological
computer that are that are broken let's

1284
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
computer that are that are broken let's
 

1285
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,950
computer that are that are broken let's
say your ability

1286
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:18,960
say your ability
 

1287
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,310
say your ability
to if you've got a stroke that if you've

1288
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,320
to if you've got a stroke that if you've
 

1289
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,789
to if you've got a stroke that if you've
had a stroke that means you got some

1290
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
had a stroke that means you got some
 

1291
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,710
had a stroke that means you got some
part of your brain is damaged um if that

1292
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:25,720
part of your brain is damaged um if that
 

1293
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,630
part of your brain is damaged um if that
let's say it's a speech generation or

1294
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:27,640
let's say it's a speech generation or
 

1295
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,590
let's say it's a speech generation or
the ability to move your left hand um

1296
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
the ability to move your left hand um
 

1297
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,269
the ability to move your left hand um
that's the kind of thing that neuralink

1298
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:31,279
that's the kind of thing that neuralink
 

1299
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,830
that's the kind of thing that neuralink
could solve um if it's uh if if you've

1300
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:35,840
could solve um if it's uh if if you've
 

1301
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,830
could solve um if it's uh if if you've
got like a massive amount of memory loss

1302
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:37,840
got like a massive amount of memory loss
 

1303
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,549
got like a massive amount of memory loss
that's just gone um well we can't go we

1304
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
that's just gone um well we can't go we
 

1305
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,750
that's just gone um well we can't go we
can't get the Memories Back uh we could

1306
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:42,760
can't get the Memories Back uh we could
 

1307
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,750
can't get the Memories Back uh we could
restore your ability to make memories

1308
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:44,760
restore your ability to make memories
 

1309
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,310
restore your ability to make memories
but we can't you know uh restore

1310
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
but we can't you know uh restore
 

1311
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,750
but we can't you know uh restore
memories that are that are fully gone um

1312
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:50,760
memories that are that are fully gone um
 

1313
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,350
memories that are that are fully gone um
now now I should say if if if you maybe

1314
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:54,360
now now I should say if if if you maybe
 

1315
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,789
now now I should say if if if you maybe
if part of the me memory is there um and

1316
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:57,799
if part of the me memory is there um and
 

1317
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:00,590
if part of the me memory is there um and
the means of accessing the memory is the

1318
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:00,600
the means of accessing the memory is the
 

1319
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,350
the means of accessing the memory is the
pot that's broken then we could reenable

1320
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:02,360
pot that's broken then we could reenable
 

1321
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,590
pot that's broken then we could reenable
the pot the ability to access the

1322
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:04,600
the pot the ability to access the
 

1323
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,990
the pot the ability to access the
memory so but you can think of like Ram

1324
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,000
memory so but you can think of like Ram
 

1325
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,750
memory so but you can think of like Ram
in your you know in a computer If U you

1326
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:09,760
in your you know in a computer If U you
 

1327
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,310
in your you know in a computer If U you
know if the ram is destroyed or your SD

1328
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,320
know if the ram is destroyed or your SD
 

1329
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,950
know if the ram is destroyed or your SD
card is destroyed you can't get that

1330
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:13,960
card is destroyed you can't get that
 

1331
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,830
card is destroyed you can't get that
back but if the connection to the SD

1332
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
back but if the connection to the SD
 

1333
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,590
back but if the connection to the SD
card is destroyed we can fix that if if

1334
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:19,600
card is destroyed we can fix that if if
 

1335
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,750
card is destroyed we can fix that if if
it is fixable physically then yeah then

1336
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:21,760
it is fixable physically then yeah then
 

1337
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,590
it is fixable physically then yeah then
it can be fixed of course with AI you

1338
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
it can be fixed of course with AI you
 

1339
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,830
it can be fixed of course with AI you
can just like you can repair photographs

1340
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:26,840
can just like you can repair photographs
 

1341
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,350
can just like you can repair photographs
and fill in missing parts parts of

1342
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,360
and fill in missing parts parts of
 

1343
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,269
and fill in missing parts parts of
photographs maybe you can do the same

1344
00:28:30,269 --> 00:28:30,279
photographs maybe you can do the same
 

1345
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,830
photographs maybe you can do the same
just yeah you could say like uh create

1346
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:32,840
just yeah you could say like uh create
 

1347
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,909
just yeah you could say like uh create
the most probable set of memories based

1348
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:34,919
the most probable set of memories based
 

1349
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,630
the most probable set of memories based
on the all information you have about

1350
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:38,640
on the all information you have about
 

1351
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,549
on the all information you have about
that person you could then Pro it would

1352
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
that person you could then Pro it would
 

1353
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,789
that person you could then Pro it would
be prob probabilistic restoration of

1354
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
be prob probabilistic restoration of
 

1355
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,269
be prob probabilistic restoration of
memory now we're getting pretty esoteric

1356
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:46,279
memory now we're getting pretty esoteric
 

1357
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:48,509
memory now we're getting pretty esoteric
here but that is one of the most

1358
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:48,519
here but that is one of the most
 

1359
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:49,909
here but that is one of the most
beautiful aspects of The Human

1360
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919
beautiful aspects of The Human
 

1361
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,590
beautiful aspects of The Human
Experience is remembering the good

1362
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
Experience is remembering the good
 

1363
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,470
Experience is remembering the good
memories like we sure we live most of

1364
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,480
memories like we sure we live most of
 

1365
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,669
memories like we sure we live most of
our life as Danny Conan just talked

1366
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:56,679
our life as Danny Conan just talked
 

1367
00:28:56,679 --> 00:28:59,070
our life as Danny Conan just talked
about in our memories not in the moment

1368
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,080
about in our memories not in the moment
 

1369
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,669
about in our memories not in the moment
we just we're collecting memories and we

1370
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:00,679
we just we're collecting memories and we
 

1371
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:02,909
we just we're collecting memories and we
kind of relive them in our head and

1372
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:02,919
kind of relive them in our head and
 

1373
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:05,430
kind of relive them in our head and
there that's the good times if you just

1374
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
there that's the good times if you just
 

1375
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,029
there that's the good times if you just
integrate over our entire life it's

1376
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
integrate over our entire life it's
 

1377
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,070
integrate over our entire life it's
remembering the good times sure that

1378
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,080
remembering the good times sure that
 

1379
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,190
remembering the good times sure that
produces the largest amount of happiness

1380
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
produces the largest amount of happiness
 

1381
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,990
produces the largest amount of happiness
and so yeah I mean what are we but our

1382
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,000
and so yeah I mean what are we but our
 

1383
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,230
and so yeah I mean what are we but our
memories and and what is death but the

1384
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,240
memories and and what is death but the
 

1385
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,630
memories and and what is death but the
loss of

1386
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:17,640
loss of
 

1387
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,590
loss of
memory loss of

1388
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
memory loss of
 

1389
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,509
memory loss of
information um you know if you if you

1390
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:21,519
information um you know if you if you
 

1391
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,549
information um you know if you if you
could say like

1392
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559
could say like
 

1393
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,070
could say like
well if if if you could be you run a

1394
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,080
well if if if you could be you run a
 

1395
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,110
well if if if you could be you run a
thought experiment well if if you were

1396
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:28,120
thought experiment well if if you were
 

1397
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,630
thought experiment well if if you were
disintegrated painlessly uh and then

1398
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:30,640
disintegrated painlessly uh and then
 

1399
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,590
disintegrated painlessly uh and then
rein reintegrated a moment later like

1400
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:32,600
rein reintegrated a moment later like
 

1401
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,470
rein reintegrated a moment later like
teleportation I guess uh provided

1402
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
teleportation I guess uh provided
 

1403
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,269
teleportation I guess uh provided
there's no information loss that the the

1404
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:37,279
there's no information loss that the the
 

1405
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,389
there's no information loss that the the
fact that your one body was

1406
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:38,399
fact that your one body was
 

1407
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,509
fact that your one body was
disintegrated is irrelevant and memories

1408
00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:40,519
disintegrated is irrelevant and memories
 

1409
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:43,350
disintegrated is irrelevant and memories
is just such a huge part of that death

1410
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:43,360
is just such a huge part of that death
 

1411
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,669
is just such a huge part of that death
is fundamentally the loss of

1412
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
is fundamentally the loss of
 

1413
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,029
is fundamentally the loss of
information the loss of

1414
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:48,039
information the loss of
 

1415
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,549
information the loss of
memory so if we can store them as

1416
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:50,559
memory so if we can store them as
 

1417
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,190
memory so if we can store them as
accurately as possible we basically

1418
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
accurately as possible we basically
 

1419
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,669
accurately as possible we basically
achieve a kind of immortality

1420
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:56,679
achieve a kind of immortality
 

1421
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,549
achieve a kind of immortality
yeah you've talked

1422
00:29:59,549 --> 00:29:59,559
yeah you've talked
 

1423
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,310
yeah you've talked
about the the threats the safety

1424
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
about the the threats the safety
 

1425
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,909
about the the threats the safety
concerns of AI let's look at long-term

1426
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:04,919
concerns of AI let's look at long-term
 

1427
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:07,389
concerns of AI let's look at long-term
Visions you think New link

1428
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:07,399
Visions you think New link
 

1429
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:11,230
Visions you think New link
is in your view the the best current

1430
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:11,240
is in your view the the best current
 

1431
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,870
is in your view the the best current
approach we have for AI safety it's an

1432
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:13,880
approach we have for AI safety it's an
 

1433
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,710
approach we have for AI safety it's an
idea that may help with AI safety um

1434
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
idea that may help with AI safety um
 

1435
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,750
idea that may help with AI safety um
certainly not I wouldn't want I would

1436
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:18,760
certainly not I wouldn't want I would
 

1437
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,870
certainly not I wouldn't want I would
wouldn't want to claim it's like some

1438
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:19,880
wouldn't want to claim it's like some
 

1439
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,029
wouldn't want to claim it's like some
Panacea or that's a sure thing um

1440
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:24,039
Panacea or that's a sure thing um
 

1441
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:26,389
Panacea or that's a sure thing um
but I mean many years ago I was thinking

1442
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
but I mean many years ago I was thinking
 

1443
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,190
but I mean many years ago I was thinking
like well what

1444
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
like well what
 

1445
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,230
like well what
um what would

1446
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,240
um what would
 

1447
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,389
um what would
inhibit alignment of human Collective

1448
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:35,399
inhibit alignment of human Collective
 

1449
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,549
inhibit alignment of human Collective
human will with uh artificial

1450
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
human will with uh artificial
 

1451
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,870
human will with uh artificial
intelligence and the low data rate of

1452
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:41,880
intelligence and the low data rate of
 

1453
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,630
intelligence and the low data rate of
humans especially our our slow output

1454
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:44,640
humans especially our our slow output
 

1455
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,070
humans especially our our slow output
rate um would necessarily just because

1456
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,080
rate um would necessarily just because
 

1457
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,269
rate um would necessarily just because
it's such a because the communication is

1458
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:50,279
it's such a because the communication is
 

1459
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,710
it's such a because the communication is
so slow would uh diminish the link

1460
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:55,720
so slow would uh diminish the link
 

1461
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,230
so slow would uh diminish the link
between humans and computers

1462
00:30:59,230 --> 00:30:59,240
between humans and computers
 

1463
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,629
between humans and computers
like the more you are a

1464
00:31:00,629 --> 00:31:00,639
like the more you are a
 

1465
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:03,750
like the more you are a
tree the less you know what the tree is

1466
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
tree the less you know what the tree is
 

1467
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,509
tree the less you know what the tree is
like let's say you you look at a tree

1468
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:05,519
like let's say you you look at a tree
 

1469
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,629
like let's say you you look at a tree
you look at this plant or whatever and

1470
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:06,639
you look at this plant or whatever and
 

1471
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:08,029
you look at this plant or whatever and
like hey I'd really like to make that

1472
00:31:08,029 --> 00:31:08,039
like hey I'd really like to make that
 

1473
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,750
like hey I'd really like to make that
plant happy but it's not saying a lot

1474
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
plant happy but it's not saying a lot
 

1475
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,430
plant happy but it's not saying a lot
you

1476
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:10,440
you
 

1477
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,269
you
know so the more we increase the data

1478
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:13,279
know so the more we increase the data
 

1479
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,830
know so the more we increase the data
rate that humans uh can intake and

1480
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:15,840
rate that humans uh can intake and
 

1481
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,430
rate that humans uh can intake and
output then that means the better the

1482
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:18,440
output then that means the better the
 

1483
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,430
output then that means the better the
higher the chance we have in a world

1484
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:20,440
higher the chance we have in a world
 

1485
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,389
higher the chance we have in a world
full of agis yeah we could better align

1486
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:23,399
full of agis yeah we could better align
 

1487
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:27,310
full of agis yeah we could better align
Collective human will with the AI if the

1488
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:27,320
Collective human will with the AI if the
 

1489
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,509
Collective human will with the AI if the
output rate especially was dramatically

1490
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:29,519
output rate especially was dramatically
 

1491
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,110
output rate especially was dramatically
increased like and I think there there's

1492
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,120
increased like and I think there there's
 

1493
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,070
increased like and I think there there's
potential to increase the output rate by

1494
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,080
potential to increase the output rate by
 

1495
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,110
potential to increase the output rate by
I don't know three maybe six maybe more

1496
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,120
I don't know three maybe six maybe more
 

1497
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,430
I don't know three maybe six maybe more
orders of magnitude

1498
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:38,440
orders of magnitude
 

1499
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,789
orders of magnitude
so it's better than the current

1500
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:40,799
so it's better than the current
 

1501
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,870
so it's better than the current
situation and that output rate would be

1502
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:43,880
situation and that output rate would be
 

1503
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,750
situation and that output rate would be
by increasing the number of electrodes

1504
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:45,760
by increasing the number of electrodes
 

1505
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,350
by increasing the number of electrodes
number of channels and also may be

1506
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,360
number of channels and also may be
 

1507
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,870
number of channels and also may be
implanting multiple neural links

1508
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:50,880
implanting multiple neural links
 

1509
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,830
implanting multiple neural links
yeah do you think there will be a world

1510
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:53,840
yeah do you think there will be a world
 

1511
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,110
yeah do you think there will be a world
in the next couple of decades where it's

1512
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,120
in the next couple of decades where it's
 

1513
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,350
in the next couple of decades where it's
hundreds of millions of people have

1514
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
hundreds of millions of people have
 

1515
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,269
hundreds of millions of people have
neuralink

1516
00:31:59,269 --> 00:31:59,279
neuralink
 

1517
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,190
neuralink
yeah I

1518
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
yeah I
 

1519
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,549
yeah I
do you think when people just when they

1520
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
do you think when people just when they
 

1521
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,830
do you think when people just when they
see the capabilities the Superhuman

1522
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:06,840
see the capabilities the Superhuman
 

1523
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,029
see the capabilities the Superhuman
capabilities that are possible and then

1524
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:09,039
capabilities that are possible and then
 

1525
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,909
capabilities that are possible and then
the the safety is demonstrated yeah if

1526
00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:11,919
the the safety is demonstrated yeah if
 

1527
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:16,629
the the safety is demonstrated yeah if
it's extremely safe um and you have and

1528
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:16,639
it's extremely safe um and you have and
 

1529
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:19,190
it's extremely safe um and you have and
you can have superhuman abilities um and

1530
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:19,200
you can have superhuman abilities um and
 

1531
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,470
you can have superhuman abilities um and
let's say you

1532
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:20,480
let's say you
 

1533
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,669
let's say you
can upload your

1534
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:22,679
can upload your
 

1535
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,750
can upload your
memories um you know so you wouldn't you

1536
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:25,760
memories um you know so you wouldn't you
 

1537
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,909
memories um you know so you wouldn't you
wouldn't lose memories um then

1538
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:28,919
wouldn't lose memories um then
 

1539
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,149
wouldn't lose memories um then
then I think probably a lot of people

1540
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:31,159
then I think probably a lot of people
 

1541
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,430
then I think probably a lot of people
would choose to have it it would

1542
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:33,440
would choose to have it it would
 

1543
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,230
would choose to have it it would
supersede the cell phone for example I

1544
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:35,240
supersede the cell phone for example I
 

1545
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,909
supersede the cell phone for example I
mean it's the the biggest problem that a

1546
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:37,919
mean it's the the biggest problem that a
 

1547
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,669
mean it's the the biggest problem that a
say a phone has um is is trying to

1548
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:42,679
say a phone has um is is trying to
 

1549
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:44,750
say a phone has um is is trying to
figure out what you

1550
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:44,760
figure out what you
 

1551
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,350
figure out what you
want so that's why you've got uh you

1552
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
want so that's why you've got uh you
 

1553
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,389
want so that's why you've got uh you
know auto complete and you've got output

1554
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:50,399
know auto complete and you've got output
 

1555
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,750
know auto complete and you've got output
which is all the pixels in the screen

1556
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:51,760
which is all the pixels in the screen
 

1557
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,950
which is all the pixels in the screen
but from the perspective of the human

1558
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:52,960
but from the perspective of the human
 

1559
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,909
but from the perspective of the human
the output is so freaking slow desktop

1560
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
the output is so freaking slow desktop
 

1561
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,549
the output is so freaking slow desktop
or phone is desperately just trying to

1562
00:32:57,549 --> 00:32:57,559
or phone is desperately just trying to
 

1563
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,789
or phone is desperately just trying to
understand what you

1564
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:58,799
understand what you
 

1565
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,710
understand what you
want and and um you know there's an

1566
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:01,720
want and and um you know there's an
 

1567
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,710
want and and um you know there's an
alterity between every keystroke from a

1568
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:03,720
alterity between every keystroke from a
 

1569
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,190
alterity between every keystroke from a
computer

1570
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,200
computer
 

1571
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,430
computer
standpoint yeah so the computer's

1572
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:08,440
standpoint yeah so the computer's
 

1573
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,710
standpoint yeah so the computer's
talking to a tree a slow moving tree

1574
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,720
talking to a tree a slow moving tree
 

1575
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,669
talking to a tree a slow moving tree
that's trying to swipe

1576
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:13,679
that's trying to swipe
 

1577
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,310
that's trying to swipe
yeah so you know if you computers that

1578
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
yeah so you know if you computers that
 

1579
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,310
yeah so you know if you computers that
are doing trillions of instructions per

1580
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,320
are doing trillions of instructions per
 

1581
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,830
are doing trillions of instructions per
second and a whole second went

1582
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:20,840
second and a whole second went
 

1583
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:23,350
second and a whole second went
by I there a trillion things it could

1584
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,360
by I there a trillion things it could
 

1585
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,710
by I there a trillion things it could
have done you know yeah I think it's

1586
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:26,720
have done you know yeah I think it's
 

1587
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,269
have done you know yeah I think it's
exciting and scary for people because

1588
00:33:29,269 --> 00:33:29,279
exciting and scary for people because
 

1589
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,990
exciting and scary for people because
once you have a very high bit rate that

1590
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,000
once you have a very high bit rate that
 

1591
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,190
once you have a very high bit rate that
changes The Human Experience in a way

1592
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
changes The Human Experience in a way
 

1593
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,110
changes The Human Experience in a way
that's very hard to imagine yeah it

1594
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,120
that's very hard to imagine yeah it
 

1595
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,190
that's very hard to imagine yeah it
would

1596
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,200
would
 

1597
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,269
would
be we would be something different I

1598
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:40,279
be we would be something different I
 

1599
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:43,590
be we would be something different I
mean some sort of futuristic cyborg I I

1600
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:43,600
mean some sort of futuristic cyborg I I
 

1601
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,909
mean some sort of futuristic cyborg I I
mean we're obviously talking about by

1602
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:44,919
mean we're obviously talking about by
 

1603
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,350
mean we're obviously talking about by
the way like it's not like not like

1604
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:46,360
the way like it's not like not like
 

1605
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,230
the way like it's not like not like
around the corner it's you ask me what

1606
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:48,240
around the corner it's you ask me what
 

1607
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,950
around the corner it's you ask me what
the f distant future it's like maybe

1608
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:49,960
the f distant future it's like maybe
 

1609
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,710
the f distant future it's like maybe
this is like it's not super far away it

1610
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,720
this is like it's not super far away it
 

1611
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,029
this is like it's not super far away it
10 15 years that kind of thing

1612
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:58,039

 

1613
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,669

when can I get

1614
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
when can I get
 

1615
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,830
when can I get
one 10

1616
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
one 10
 

1617
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,750
one 10
years probably less than 10

1618
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:04,760
years probably less than 10
 

1619
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,990
years probably less than 10
years depends on what you want want want

1620
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,000
years depends on what you want want want
 

1621
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,589
years depends on what you want want want
to do you know hey if I can get like a

1622
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:09,599
to do you know hey if I can get like a
 

1623
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,310
to do you know hey if I can get like a
th000 BPS th000 BPS and it's safe and I

1624
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:13,320
th000 BPS th000 BPS and it's safe and I
 

1625
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,510
th000 BPS th000 BPS and it's safe and I
can just interact with a computer while

1626
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:15,520
can just interact with a computer while
 

1627
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,109
can just interact with a computer while
laying back and eating Cheetos I don't

1628
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:18,119
laying back and eating Cheetos I don't
 

1629
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,829
laying back and eating Cheetos I don't
eat Cheetos there's certain aspects of

1630
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:20,839
eat Cheetos there's certain aspects of
 

1631
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:22,190
eat Cheetos there's certain aspects of
human computer interaction when done

1632
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,200
human computer interaction when done
 

1633
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,869
human computer interaction when done
more efficiently and more enjoyably I

1634
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:24,879
more efficiently and more enjoyably I
 

1635
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,109
more efficiently and more enjoyably I
don't like worth it well we feel pretty

1636
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
don't like worth it well we feel pretty
 

1637
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,950
don't like worth it well we feel pretty
confident that

1638
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:28,960
confident that
 

1639
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,270
confident that
um I think maybe within the next year or

1640
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:32,280
um I think maybe within the next year or
 

1641
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,990
um I think maybe within the next year or
two that someone with a neuralink

1642
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
two that someone with a neuralink
 

1643
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,149
two that someone with a neuralink
implant will be able to outperform um a

1644
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:38,159
implant will be able to outperform um a
 

1645
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,030
implant will be able to outperform um a
Pro

1646
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,040
Pro
 

1647
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,790
Pro
Gamer nice uh because the reaction time

1648
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:41,800
Gamer nice uh because the reaction time
 

1649
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,950
Gamer nice uh because the reaction time
would be

1650
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:43,960
would be
 

1651
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,310
would be
faster I got to visit Memphis yeah yeah

1652
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:47,320
faster I got to visit Memphis yeah yeah
 

1653
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,230
faster I got to visit Memphis yeah yeah
you're going big on compute yeah and

1654
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,240
you're going big on compute yeah and
 

1655
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,909
you're going big on compute yeah and
you've also said play to win or don't

1656
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:50,919
you've also said play to win or don't
 

1657
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,349
you've also said play to win or don't
play at all so yeah what does it take to

1658
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
play at all so yeah what does it take to
 

1659
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,390
play at all so yeah what does it take to
win um for AI that means you've got to

1660
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:56,400
win um for AI that means you've got to
 

1661
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,390
win um for AI that means you've got to
have the most powerful training

1662
00:34:59,390 --> 00:34:59,400
have the most powerful training
 

1663
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,510
have the most powerful training
compute and your the the rate of

1664
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
compute and your the the rate of
 

1665
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,510
compute and your the the rate of
improvement of training compute has to

1666
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,520
improvement of training compute has to
 

1667
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,790
improvement of training compute has to
be faster

1668
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:04,800
be faster
 

1669
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,150
be faster
than everyone else or you will not win

1670
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,160
than everyone else or you will not win
 

1671
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,990
than everyone else or you will not win
you your AI will be worse so how can

1672
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,000
you your AI will be worse so how can
 

1673
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,670
you your AI will be worse so how can
grock let's say three that might be

1674
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:13,680
grock let's say three that might be
 

1675
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,870
grock let's say three that might be
available what like next year well

1676
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:15,880
available what like next year well
 

1677
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,829
available what like next year well
hopefully end of this year grock 3 for

1678
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
hopefully end of this year grock 3 for
 

1679
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,790
hopefully end of this year grock 3 for
Lucky yeah how can that be the best llm

1680
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:23,800
Lucky yeah how can that be the best llm
 

1681
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,510
Lucky yeah how can that be the best llm
the best AI system available in the

1682
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,520
the best AI system available in the
 

1683
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,270
the best AI system available in the
world how much of it is a compute

1684
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:28,280
world how much of it is a compute
 

1685
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,270
world how much of it is a compute
how much of it is Data how much of it is

1686
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:30,280
how much of it is Data how much of it is
 

1687
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,990
how much of it is Data how much of it is
like post training how much of it is the

1688
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:32,000
like post training how much of it is the
 

1689
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,470
like post training how much of it is the
product that you package it up in all

1690
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
product that you package it up in all
 

1691
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,470
product that you package it up in all
that kind of

1692
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:36,480
that kind of
 

1693
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,750
that kind of
stuff I mean they will matter it's sort

1694
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:38,760
stuff I mean they will matter it's sort
 

1695
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,990
stuff I mean they will matter it's sort
of like saying what what you know let's

1696
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,000
of like saying what what you know let's
 

1697
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,390
of like saying what what you know let's
say it's a Formula 1 race like what

1698
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,400
say it's a Formula 1 race like what
 

1699
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,990
say it's a Formula 1 race like what
matters more the car or the driver I

1700
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
matters more the car or the driver I
 

1701
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,430
matters more the car or the driver I
mean they both matter um if if if your

1702
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,440
mean they both matter um if if if your
 

1703
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,950
mean they both matter um if if if your
if your car is not fast then you know if

1704
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960
if your car is not fast then you know if
 

1705
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,190
if your car is not fast then you know if
it's like let's say half the horsepower

1706
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,200
it's like let's say half the horsepower
 

1707
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,870
it's like let's say half the horsepower
of a competitors the best driver will

1708
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:53,880
of a competitors the best driver will
 

1709
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,190
of a competitors the best driver will
still lose on if it's twice the

1710
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,200
still lose on if it's twice the
 

1711
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,470
still lose on if it's twice the
horsepower then probably even a

1712
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:58,480
horsepower then probably even a
 

1713
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,790
horsepower then probably even a
mediocre driver will still win so the

1714
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:01,800
mediocre driver will still win so the
 

1715
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,870
mediocre driver will still win so the
training computer is kind of like the

1716
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
training computer is kind of like the
 

1717
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,390
training computer is kind of like the
engine how many this horsepower of the

1718
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:04,400
engine how many this horsepower of the
 

1719
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,630
engine how many this horsepower of the
engine so you really you want to try to

1720
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:07,640
engine so you really you want to try to
 

1721
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,990
engine so you really you want to try to
do the best on that and you

1722
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
do the best on that and you
 

1723
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,870
do the best on that and you
then um then how efficiently do you use

1724
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
then um then how efficiently do you use
 

1725
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,030
then um then how efficiently do you use
that training compute and how

1726
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,040
that training compute and how
 

1727
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,109
that training compute and how
efficiently do you do the inference the

1728
00:36:17,109 --> 00:36:17,119
efficiently do you do the inference the
 

1729
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,910
efficiently do you do the inference the
uh use of the AI um so obvious that

1730
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:20,920
uh use of the AI um so obvious that
 

1731
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,309
uh use of the AI um so obvious that
comes down to human Talent um and then

1732
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:23,319
comes down to human Talent um and then
 

1733
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,710
comes down to human Talent um and then
what unique access to data do you have

1734
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:25,720
what unique access to data do you have
 

1735
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,870
what unique access to data do you have
uh that's also plays a plays a role you

1736
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:28,880
uh that's also plays a plays a role you
 

1737
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,069
uh that's also plays a plays a role you
think Twitter data will be useful uh

1738
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:31,079
think Twitter data will be useful uh
 

1739
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,270
think Twitter data will be useful uh
yeah I mean I think I think most of the

1740
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:34,280
yeah I mean I think I think most of the
 

1741
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,190
yeah I mean I think I think most of the
leading AI companies were already have

1742
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:36,200
leading AI companies were already have
 

1743
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,069
leading AI companies were already have
already scraped uh all the Twitter

1744
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:39,079
already scraped uh all the Twitter
 

1745
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,670
already scraped uh all the Twitter
data not I think they have um so I on a

1746
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
data not I think they have um so I on a
 

1747
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,270
data not I think they have um so I on a
go forward basis what's useful is is is

1748
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:46,280
go forward basis what's useful is is is
 

1749
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,349
go forward basis what's useful is is is
the fact that it's up to the second you

1750
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:48,359
the fact that it's up to the second you
 

1751
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,710
the fact that it's up to the second you
know that's the because it's hard for

1752
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
know that's the because it's hard for
 

1753
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,870
know that's the because it's hard for
them to scra in real time so there's

1754
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
them to scra in real time so there's
 

1755
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,670
them to scra in real time so there's
there's

1756
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:53,680
there's
 

1757
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,510
there's
a an immediacy advantage that Gro has

1758
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:56,520
a an immediacy advantage that Gro has
 

1759
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,870
a an immediacy advantage that Gro has
already I think with Tesla and the

1760
00:36:59,870 --> 00:36:59,880
already I think with Tesla and the
 

1761
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,670
already I think with Tesla and the
real-time video coming from several

1762
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
real-time video coming from several
 

1763
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,270
real-time video coming from several
million cars ultimately tens of millions

1764
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,280
million cars ultimately tens of millions
 

1765
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,430
million cars ultimately tens of millions
of cars with Optimus there might be

1766
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:06,440
of cars with Optimus there might be
 

1767
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,750
of cars with Optimus there might be
hundreds of millions of Optimus robots

1768
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:08,760
hundreds of millions of Optimus robots
 

1769
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,309
hundreds of millions of Optimus robots
maybe billions learning a tremendous

1770
00:37:11,309 --> 00:37:11,319
maybe billions learning a tremendous
 

1771
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:13,950
maybe billions learning a tremendous
amount from The Real World uh that's

1772
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:13,960
amount from The Real World uh that's
 

1773
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,670
amount from The Real World uh that's
that's the the biggest source of data I

1774
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:16,680
that's the the biggest source of data I
 

1775
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,589
that's the the biggest source of data I
think ultimately is is sort of Optimus

1776
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:18,599
think ultimately is is sort of Optimus
 

1777
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,349
think ultimately is is sort of Optimus
probably is Optimus is going to be the

1778
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:20,359
probably is Optimus is going to be the
 

1779
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:22,430
probably is Optimus is going to be the
biggest source of data because it's

1780
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:22,440
biggest source of data because it's
 

1781
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,390
biggest source of data because it's
because reality

1782
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
because reality
 

1783
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,589
because reality
scales reality scales to the scale of

1784
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:26,599
scales reality scales to the scale of
 

1785
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,270
scales reality scales to the scale of
reality um it's actually humbling to see

1786
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:30,280
reality um it's actually humbling to see
 

1787
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,109
reality um it's actually humbling to see
how little data humans have actually

1788
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:33,119
how little data humans have actually
 

1789
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,750
how little data humans have actually
been able to accumulate um really say

1790
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:36,760
been able to accumulate um really say
 

1791
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,870
been able to accumulate um really say
how many trillions of usable tokens have

1792
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:39,880
how many trillions of usable tokens have
 

1793
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,910
how many trillions of usable tokens have
humans generated where on a non-

1794
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:42,920
humans generated where on a non-
 

1795
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,630
humans generated where on a non-
duplicate of like discounting spam and

1796
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:47,640
duplicate of like discounting spam and
 

1797
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,710
duplicate of like discounting spam and
repetitive stuff it's not a huge number

1798
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:51,720
repetitive stuff it's not a huge number
 

1799
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,510
repetitive stuff it's not a huge number
you run out pretty quickly and Optimus

1800
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
you run out pretty quickly and Optimus
 

1801
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,950
you run out pretty quickly and Optimus
can go so Tesla cars can or

1802
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:57,960
can go so Tesla cars can or
 

1803
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,710
can go so Tesla cars can or
unfortunately have to stay on the

1804
00:37:59,710 --> 00:37:59,720
unfortunately have to stay on the
 

1805
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,750
unfortunately have to stay on the
road uh Optimus robot can go anywhere

1806
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:02,760
road uh Optimus robot can go anywhere
 

1807
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,670
road uh Optimus robot can go anywhere
there's more reality off the road and go

1808
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:05,680
there's more reality off the road and go
 

1809
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,870
there's more reality off the road and go
off I mean thought from the St can like

1810
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:07,880
off I mean thought from the St can like
 

1811
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,829
off I mean thought from the St can like
pick up the cup and see did it pick up

1812
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:09,839
pick up the cup and see did it pick up
 

1813
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,990
pick up the cup and see did it pick up
the cup in the right way did it you know

1814
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000
the cup in the right way did it you know
 

1815
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,069
the cup in the right way did it you know
say pour water in the cup you know did

1816
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,079
say pour water in the cup you know did
 

1817
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,710
say pour water in the cup you know did
the water go in the cup or not go in the

1818
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:17,720
the water go in the cup or not go in the
 

1819
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,710
the water go in the cup or not go in the
cup did it spill water or not yeah um

1820
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:21,720
cup did it spill water or not yeah um
 

1821
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,430
cup did it spill water or not yeah um
simple stuff like that I mean but it can

1822
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440
simple stuff like that I mean but it can
 

1823
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,630
simple stuff like that I mean but it can
do at that at scale times a billion you

1824
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:26,640
do at that at scale times a billion you
 

1825
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,109
do at that at scale times a billion you
know so

1826
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:28,119
know so
 

1827
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,390
know so
generate use useful data from reality so

1828
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
generate use useful data from reality so
 

1829
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,670
generate use useful data from reality so
it cause and effect stuff what do you

1830
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:34,680
it cause and effect stuff what do you
 

1831
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,670
it cause and effect stuff what do you
think it takes to get to mass production

1832
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:37,680
think it takes to get to mass production
 

1833
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,349
think it takes to get to mass production
of humanoid robots like that it's the

1834
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:40,359
of humanoid robots like that it's the
 

1835
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,990
of humanoid robots like that it's the
same as cars really I mean Global

1836
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,000
same as cars really I mean Global
 

1837
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,230
same as cars really I mean Global
capacity for vehicles um is about 100

1838
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:47,240
capacity for vehicles um is about 100
 

1839
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,710
capacity for vehicles um is about 100
million a

1840
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
million a
 

1841
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,910
million a
year and

1842
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:50,920
year and
 

1843
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,109
year and
uh it it could be higher it's just that

1844
00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:53,119
uh it it could be higher it's just that
 

1845
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,510
uh it it could be higher it's just that
the demand is on the order of 100

1846
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:54,520
the demand is on the order of 100
 

1847
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,069
the demand is on the order of 100
million a year and then there's roughly

1848
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:56,079
million a year and then there's roughly
 

1849
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,750
million a year and then there's roughly
2 billion uh vehicles that are in use in

1850
00:38:59,750 --> 00:38:59,760
2 billion uh vehicles that are in use in
 

1851
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,750
2 billion uh vehicles that are in use in
some way so which makes sense like the

1852
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:02,760
some way so which makes sense like the
 

1853
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,390
some way so which makes sense like the
the life of a vehicle is about 20 years

1854
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,400
the life of a vehicle is about 20 years
 

1855
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,750
the life of a vehicle is about 20 years
so at steady state you can have 100

1856
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
so at steady state you can have 100
 

1857
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,270
so at steady state you can have 100
million Vehicles produced a year with a

1858
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
million Vehicles produced a year with a
 

1859
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,589
million Vehicles produced a year with a
with a 2 billion vehicle Fleet roughly

1860
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:10,599
with a 2 billion vehicle Fleet roughly
 

1861
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,390
with a 2 billion vehicle Fleet roughly
um now for humanoid robots the utility

1862
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:13,400
um now for humanoid robots the utility
 

1863
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,349
um now for humanoid robots the utility
is much greater so my guess is human

1864
00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:16,359
is much greater so my guess is human
 

1865
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:18,710
is much greater so my guess is human
robots are more like at a billion plus

1866
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:18,720
robots are more like at a billion plus
 

1867
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,270
robots are more like at a billion plus
per year but you know until you came

1868
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:21,280
per year but you know until you came
 

1869
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,829
per year but you know until you came
along and started uh building Optimus it

1870
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:24,839
along and started uh building Optimus it
 

1871
00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:26,670
along and started uh building Optimus it
it was thought to be an extremely

1872
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:26,680
it was thought to be an extremely
 

1873
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,190
it was thought to be an extremely
difficult problem I mean it's still

1874
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:28,200
difficult problem I mean it's still
 

1875
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,150
difficult problem I mean it's still
extremely difficult it's no walk in the

1876
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,160
extremely difficult it's no walk in the
 

1877
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,790
extremely difficult it's no walk in the
park I mean op Optimus currently would

1878
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:33,800
park I mean op Optimus currently would
 

1879
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,829
park I mean op Optimus currently would
struggle to have to walk in the park I

1880
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:36,839
struggle to have to walk in the park I
 

1881
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,230
struggle to have to walk in the park I
mean it can walk in a par Park is not

1882
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:39,240
mean it can walk in a par Park is not
 

1883
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,349
mean it can walk in a par Park is not
too difficult but it will be able to

1884
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359
too difficult but it will be able to
 

1885
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,750
too difficult but it will be able to
walk um over a wide range of terrain

1886
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,760
walk um over a wide range of terrain
 

1887
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,870
walk um over a wide range of terrain
yeah and pick up objects yeah yeah they

1888
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:46,880
yeah and pick up objects yeah yeah they
 

1889
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,230
yeah and pick up objects yeah yeah they
can already do that but like all kinds

1890
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:49,240
can already do that but like all kinds
 

1891
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,550
can already do that but like all kinds
of objects yeah yeah all foreign objects

1892
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:51,560
of objects yeah yeah all foreign objects
 

1893
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,910
of objects yeah yeah all foreign objects
I mean pouring water in a cup is not

1894
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:53,920
I mean pouring water in a cup is not
 

1895
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,109
I mean pouring water in a cup is not
trivial because then if you don't know

1896
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:56,119
trivial because then if you don't know
 

1897
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,069
trivial because then if you don't know
anything about the container could be

1898
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:58,079
anything about the container could be
 

1899
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,030
anything about the container could be
all kinds of containers yeah there's

1900
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,040
all kinds of containers yeah there's
 

1901
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,829
all kinds of containers yeah there's
going to be an immense amount of

1902
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:00,839
going to be an immense amount of
 

1903
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,870
going to be an immense amount of
engineering just going into the hand

1904
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:02,880
engineering just going into the hand
 

1905
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,470
engineering just going into the hand
yeah the hand might

1906
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:04,480
yeah the hand might
 

1907
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,069
yeah the hand might
be it might be close to half of all the

1908
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:07,079
be it might be close to half of all the
 

1909
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:10,750
be it might be close to half of all the
engineering in the in Optimus from an

1910
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:10,760
engineering in the in Optimus from an
 

1911
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,309
engineering in the in Optimus from an
electromechanical standpoint the hand is

1912
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:13,319
electromechanical standpoint the hand is
 

1913
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:16,150
electromechanical standpoint the hand is
probably roughly half of the engineering

1914
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
probably roughly half of the engineering
 

1915
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,470
probably roughly half of the engineering
but so much of the intelligence so much

1916
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
but so much of the intelligence so much
 

1917
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,270
but so much of the intelligence so much
the intelligence of humans goes into

1918
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:20,280
the intelligence of humans goes into
 

1919
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,510
the intelligence of humans goes into
what we do with our hands yeah there the

1920
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:22,520
what we do with our hands yeah there the
 

1921
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,069
what we do with our hands yeah there the
manipulation of the world manipulation

1922
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:24,079
manipulation of the world manipulation
 

1923
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,390
manipulation of the world manipulation
of objects in the world intelligent safe

1924
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:26,400
of objects in the world intelligent safe
 

1925
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,950
of objects in the world intelligent safe
manipulation of objects in the world

1926
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:27,960
manipulation of objects in the world
 

1927
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,470
manipulation of objects in the world
yeah yeah I mean you start really

1928
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:30,480
yeah yeah I mean you start really
 

1929
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,750
yeah yeah I mean you start really
thinking about your hand and how it

1930
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:32,760
thinking about your hand and how it
 

1931
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,190
thinking about your hand and how it
works you know I do it all the time the

1932
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:35,200
works you know I do it all the time the
 

1933
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,829
works you know I do it all the time the
sensory in control of humulus is we have

1934
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
sensory in control of humulus is we have
 

1935
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,990
sensory in control of humulus is we have
humongous hands yeah so I mean like your

1936
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,000
humongous hands yeah so I mean like your
 

1937
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,790
humongous hands yeah so I mean like your
hands the actuators the muscles of your

1938
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:42,800
hands the actuators the muscles of your
 

1939
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,230
hands the actuators the muscles of your
hand are almost overwhelmingly in your

1940
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,240
hand are almost overwhelmingly in your
 

1941
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,870
hand are almost overwhelmingly in your
forearm mhm so your forearm has the has

1942
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:48,880
forearm mhm so your forearm has the has
 

1943
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,430
forearm mhm so your forearm has the has
the muscles that that actually control

1944
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:50,440
the muscles that that actually control
 

1945
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,430
the muscles that that actually control
your hand um there there's a there's a

1946
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:52,440
your hand um there there's a there's a
 

1947
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,510
your hand um there there's a there's a
few small muscles in the hand itself but

1948
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:54,520
few small muscles in the hand itself but
 

1949
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,309
few small muscles in the hand itself but
your hand is really um like a skeleton

1950
00:40:57,309 --> 00:40:57,319
your hand is really um like a skeleton
 

1951
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,870
your hand is really um like a skeleton
meat puppet and then and with cables

1952
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
meat puppet and then and with cables
 

1953
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,550
meat puppet and then and with cables
that so the the muscles that control

1954
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
that so the the muscles that control
 

1955
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,470
that so the the muscles that control
your fingers are in your forearm and

1956
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:04,480
your fingers are in your forearm and
 

1957
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,430
your fingers are in your forearm and
they go through the caral tunnel which

1958
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:06,440
they go through the caral tunnel which
 

1959
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,790
they go through the caral tunnel which
is like you've got a little collection

1960
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:07,800
is like you've got a little collection
 

1961
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,990
is like you've got a little collection
of Bones and and a tiny tunnel that the

1962
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
of Bones and and a tiny tunnel that the
 

1963
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,670
of Bones and and a tiny tunnel that the
that these cables the tendons go through

1964
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:14,680
that these cables the tendons go through
 

1965
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,670
that these cables the tendons go through
and those tendons are what um mostly

1966
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:18,680
and those tendons are what um mostly
 

1967
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,030
and those tendons are what um mostly
what movees your hands and something

1968
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,040
what movees your hands and something
 

1969
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,069
what movees your hands and something
like those tendons has to be re

1970
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:23,079
like those tendons has to be re
 

1971
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,069
like those tendons has to be re
engineered into the Optimus in order to

1972
00:41:25,069 --> 00:41:25,079
engineered into the Optimus in order to
 

1973
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,470
engineered into the Optimus in order to
do all that kind of stuff yeah so like

1974
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:27,480
do all that kind of stuff yeah so like
 

1975
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,510
do all that kind of stuff yeah so like
Optimus um we tried putting the

1976
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:29,520
Optimus um we tried putting the
 

1977
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,829
Optimus um we tried putting the
actuators in the hand itself but then

1978
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:31,839
actuators in the hand itself but then
 

1979
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,870
actuators in the hand itself but then
you you sort of end up having these like

1980
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:33,880
you you sort of end up having these like
 

1981
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,470
you you sort of end up having these like
giant hands yeah giant hands that look

1982
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:35,480
giant hands yeah giant hands that look
 

1983
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,510
giant hands yeah giant hands that look
weird yeah um and then they they don't

1984
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
weird yeah um and then they they don't
 

1985
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,550
weird yeah um and then they they don't
actually have enough degrees of freedom

1986
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:39,560
actually have enough degrees of freedom
 

1987
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,069
actually have enough degrees of freedom
and or enough strength so so then you

1988
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:43,079
and or enough strength so so then you
 

1989
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,390
and or enough strength so so then you
realiz oh okay that's why you got to put

1990
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:44,400
realiz oh okay that's why you got to put
 

1991
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,990
realiz oh okay that's why you got to put
the actuators in the forearm and and

1992
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,000
the actuators in the forearm and and
 

1993
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,550
the actuators in the forearm and and
just like a human you got to run cables

1994
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:49,560
just like a human you got to run cables
 

1995
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,150
just like a human you got to run cables
uh through a a narrow tunnel to operate

1996
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,160
uh through a a narrow tunnel to operate
 

1997
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,069
uh through a a narrow tunnel to operate
the the fingers and then there's also a

1998
00:41:55,069 --> 00:41:55,079
the the fingers and then there's also a
 

1999
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,710
the the fingers and then there's also a
reason for not having all the fingers uh

2000
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:57,720
reason for not having all the fingers uh
 

2001
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,470
reason for not having all the fingers uh
the same length so it wouldn't be

2002
00:41:59,470 --> 00:41:59,480
the same length so it wouldn't be
 

2003
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,030
the same length so it wouldn't be
expensive from an energy or evolutionary

2004
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
expensive from an energy or evolutionary
 

2005
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,109
expensive from an energy or evolutionary
standpoint to have all your fingers be

2006
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:02,119
standpoint to have all your fingers be
 

2007
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,309
standpoint to have all your fingers be
the same length so why not they the same

2008
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:03,319
the same length so why not they the same
 

2009
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:05,390
the same length so why not they the same
length yeah why not because actually

2010
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:05,400
length yeah why not because actually
 

2011
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,230
length yeah why not because actually
better to have different lengths your

2012
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:07,240
better to have different lengths your
 

2013
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,510
better to have different lengths your
dexterity is better if you've got

2014
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:08,520
dexterity is better if you've got
 

2015
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,109
dexterity is better if you've got
fingers of different length you you're

2016
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
fingers of different length you you're
 

2017
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,870
fingers of different length you you're
you have there are more things you can

2018
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:12,880
you have there are more things you can
 

2019
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,390
you have there are more things you can
do and your your dexterity is actually

2020
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:15,400
do and your your dexterity is actually
 

2021
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,270
do and your your dexterity is actually
better if your fingers are different

2022
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:17,280
better if your fingers are different
 

2023
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,470
better if your fingers are different
different length like there's a reason

2024
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:19,480
different length like there's a reason
 

2025
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,510
different length like there's a reason
you got a little finger like why don't

2026
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:20,520
you got a little finger like why don't
 

2027
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,589
you got a little finger like why don't
have a little finger that's bigger yeah

2028
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:22,599
have a little finger that's bigger yeah
 

2029
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,790
have a little finger that's bigger yeah
because it allows you to do fine it

2030
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:24,800
because it allows you to do fine it
 

2031
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,270
because it allows you to do fine it
helps you with fine motor skills that

2032
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:27,280
helps you with fine motor skills that
 

2033
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,589
helps you with fine motor skills that
this little finger helps it does

2034
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:30,599
this little finger helps it does
 

2035
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:33,349
this little finger helps it does
H if you lost your little finger it

2036
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
H if you lost your little finger it
 

2037
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,390
H if you lost your little finger it
would have noticeably less dexterity so

2038
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
would have noticeably less dexterity so
 

2039
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,670
would have noticeably less dexterity so
as you're figuring out this problem you

2040
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:37,680
as you're figuring out this problem you
 

2041
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,510
as you're figuring out this problem you
have to also figure out a way to do it

2042
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:39,520
have to also figure out a way to do it
 

2043
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,910
have to also figure out a way to do it
so you can Mass manufacture it so it's

2044
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:40,920
so you can Mass manufacture it so it's
 

2045
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,870
so you can Mass manufacture it so it's
to be as simple as possible it's

2046
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:42,880
to be as simple as possible it's
 

2047
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,750
to be as simple as possible it's
actually going to be quite complicated I

2048
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:44,760
actually going to be quite complicated I
 

2049
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,230
actually going to be quite complicated I
the the this the as possible part is

2050
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:47,240
the the this the as possible part is
 

2051
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,710
the the this the as possible part is
it's quite a high bar if you want to

2052
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
it's quite a high bar if you want to
 

2053
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,670
it's quite a high bar if you want to
have a humanoid robot that can um do

2054
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:51,680
have a humanoid robot that can um do
 

2055
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,549
have a humanoid robot that can um do
things that a human can do it's actually

2056
00:42:53,549 --> 00:42:53,559
things that a human can do it's actually
 

2057
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:56,750
things that a human can do it's actually
it's a very high bar so our new arm has

2058
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:56,760
it's a very high bar so our new arm has
 

2059
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,630
it's a very high bar so our new arm has
20 2 degrees of freedom instead of 11

2060
00:42:59,630 --> 00:42:59,640
20 2 degrees of freedom instead of 11
 

2061
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,990
20 2 degrees of freedom instead of 11
and has the like I said the actuators in

2062
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,000
and has the like I said the actuators in
 

2063
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,589
and has the like I said the actuators in
the forearm um and these all all the

2064
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
the forearm um and these all all the
 

2065
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,990
the forearm um and these all all the
actuators are designed from scratch the

2066
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:06,000
actuators are designed from scratch the
 

2067
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,670
actuators are designed from scratch the
physics first principles um that the

2068
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:08,680
physics first principles um that the
 

2069
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,750
physics first principles um that the
sensors are all designed from scratch

2070
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:10,760
sensors are all designed from scratch
 

2071
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,950
sensors are all designed from scratch
and and we we we'll continue to put um

2072
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:12,960
and and we we we'll continue to put um
 

2073
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,549
and and we we we'll continue to put um
tremendous amount of engineering effort

2074
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:14,559
tremendous amount of engineering effort
 

2075
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,829
tremendous amount of engineering effort
into improving the hand like the Hand by

2076
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:17,839
into improving the hand like the Hand by
 

2077
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,390
into improving the hand like the Hand by
by hand I mean like the the entire

2078
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:19,400
by hand I mean like the the entire
 

2079
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,030
by hand I mean like the the entire
forearm from elbow forward MH uh is is

2080
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:22,040
forearm from elbow forward MH uh is is
 

2081
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,470
forearm from elbow forward MH uh is is
really the hand

2082
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:24,480
really the hand
 

2083
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,390
really the hand
um so

2084
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:27,400
um so
 

2085
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,710
um so
that's

2086
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
that's
 

2087
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,589
that's
um incredibly difficult engineering

2088
00:43:31,589 --> 00:43:31,599
um incredibly difficult engineering
 

2089
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,589
um incredibly difficult engineering
actually and um and so then so the

2090
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:34,599
actually and um and so then so the
 

2091
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,430
actually and um and so then so the
simplest possible version of a human

2092
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:36,440
simplest possible version of a human
 

2093
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,790
simplest possible version of a human
robot that can

2094
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
robot that can
 

2095
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,470
robot that can
do even most perhaps not all of what a

2096
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:41,480
do even most perhaps not all of what a
 

2097
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,910
do even most perhaps not all of what a
human can do is actually still still

2098
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:42,920
human can do is actually still still
 

2099
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,510
human can do is actually still still
very complicated it's not it's not

2100
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:45,520
very complicated it's not it's not
 

2101
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,990
very complicated it's not it's not
simple it's very difficult can you just

2102
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,000
simple it's very difficult can you just
 

2103
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,990
simple it's very difficult can you just
speak to what it takes for a great

2104
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:50,000
speak to what it takes for a great
 

2105
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,069
speak to what it takes for a great
engineering team for you the what I've

2106
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
engineering team for you the what I've
 

2107
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,349
engineering team for you the what I've
saw in Memphis the supercomputer cluster

2108
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:55,359
saw in Memphis the supercomputer cluster
 

2109
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,990
saw in Memphis the supercomputer cluster
is just this intense drive towards

2110
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:58,000
is just this intense drive towards
 

2111
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,990
is just this intense drive towards
simplifying the process understanding

2112
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,000
simplifying the process understanding
 

2113
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,750
simplifying the process understanding
the process constantly improving it

2114
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:01,760
the process constantly improving it
 

2115
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,109
the process constantly improving it
constantly iterating

2116
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,119

 

2117
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,549

it

2118
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:09,559
it
 

2119
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,750
it
well it's easy to say simplify and it's

2120
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:12,760
well it's easy to say simplify and it's
 

2121
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,549
well it's easy to say simplify and it's
very difficult to do it

2122
00:44:16,549 --> 00:44:16,559
very difficult to do it
 

2123
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,910
very difficult to do it
um you know have this very basic first

2124
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:19,920
um you know have this very basic first
 

2125
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,030
um you know have this very basic first
basic first principles algorithm that I

2126
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,040
basic first principles algorithm that I
 

2127
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,510
basic first principles algorithm that I
run kind of as like a mantra which is to

2128
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:24,520
run kind of as like a mantra which is to
 

2129
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,190
run kind of as like a mantra which is to
first question the requirements make the

2130
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:26,200
first question the requirements make the
 

2131
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,990
first question the requirements make the
requirements um less dumb the

2132
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:29,000
requirements um less dumb the
 

2133
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,430
requirements um less dumb the
requirements are always dumb to some

2134
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:30,440
requirements are always dumb to some
 

2135
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,390
requirements are always dumb to some
degree so if you want to start off by

2136
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
degree so if you want to start off by
 

2137
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,670
degree so if you want to start off by
reducing the number of requirements um

2138
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:35,680
reducing the number of requirements um
 

2139
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,829
reducing the number of requirements um
and um no matter how smart the person is

2140
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:37,839
and um no matter how smart the person is
 

2141
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:38,950
and um no matter how smart the person is
who gave you those requirements they're

2142
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:38,960
who gave you those requirements they're
 

2143
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,950
who gave you those requirements they're
still dumb to some degree um if you you

2144
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:41,960
still dumb to some degree um if you you
 

2145
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,910
still dumb to some degree um if you you
have to start there because otherwise uh

2146
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:43,920
have to start there because otherwise uh
 

2147
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,309
have to start there because otherwise uh
you could get the perfect answer to the

2148
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:45,319
you could get the perfect answer to the
 

2149
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:47,750
you could get the perfect answer to the
wrong question so so try to make the

2150
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
wrong question so so try to make the
 

2151
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,470
wrong question so so try to make the
question the least wrong possible that's

2152
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:49,480
question the least wrong possible that's
 

2153
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,349
question the least wrong possible that's
what um question the requirements means

2154
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:53,359
what um question the requirements means
 

2155
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:55,270
what um question the requirements means
and then the second thing is try to

2156
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,280
and then the second thing is try to
 

2157
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,950
and then the second thing is try to
delete the whatever the step is the the

2158
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
delete the whatever the step is the the
 

2159
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,390
delete the whatever the step is the the
part or the process step um sounds very

2160
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:02,400
part or the process step um sounds very
 

2161
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,349
part or the process step um sounds very
obvious but um people often forget to do

2162
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
obvious but um people often forget to do
 

2163
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,910
obvious but um people often forget to do
to to try deleting it entirely and if

2164
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:09,920
to to try deleting it entirely and if
 

2165
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,150
to to try deleting it entirely and if
you're not forced to put back at least

2166
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:11,160
you're not forced to put back at least
 

2167
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,309
you're not forced to put back at least
10% of what you delete you're not

2168
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:12,319
10% of what you delete you're not
 

2169
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,069
10% of what you delete you're not
deleting enough

2170
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:15,079
deleting enough
 

2171
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,829
deleting enough
like and it's uh somewhat illogically

2172
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:18,839
like and it's uh somewhat illogically
 

2173
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:22,630
like and it's uh somewhat illogically
people often most of the time um feel as

2174
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:22,640
people often most of the time um feel as
 

2175
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,589
people often most of the time um feel as
though they've succeeded if they've not

2176
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:24,599
though they've succeeded if they've not
 

2177
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,549
though they've succeeded if they've not
been forced to put the put things back

2178
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:26,559
been forced to put the put things back
 

2179
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,030
been forced to put the put things back
in but actually they haven't because

2180
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:28,040
in but actually they haven't because
 

2181
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,829
in but actually they haven't because
they've been overly conservative and and

2182
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:29,839
they've been overly conservative and and
 

2183
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,030
they've been overly conservative and and
have left things in there that shouldn't

2184
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,040
have left things in there that shouldn't
 

2185
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,349
have left things in there that shouldn't
be so and only the third thing is try to

2186
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:37,359
be so and only the third thing is try to
 

2187
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,710
be so and only the third thing is try to
optimize it or simplify

2188
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:39,720
optimize it or simplify
 

2189
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,710
optimize it or simplify
it um again this sounds these all sound

2190
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:43,720
it um again this sounds these all sound
 

2191
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,150
it um again this sounds these all sound
I think very very obvious when I say

2192
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:45,160
I think very very obvious when I say
 

2193
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,230
I think very very obvious when I say
them but uh the number of times I've

2194
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:47,240
them but uh the number of times I've
 

2195
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,670
them but uh the number of times I've
made these mistakes is uh more than I

2196
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:50,680
made these mistakes is uh more than I
 

2197
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,670
made these mistakes is uh more than I
care to remember um that's why I have

2198
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:52,680
care to remember um that's why I have
 

2199
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,950
care to remember um that's why I have
this Mantra so in fact I'd say the the

2200
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:55,960
this Mantra so in fact I'd say the the
 

2201
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,470
this Mantra so in fact I'd say the the
most common mistake of smart Engineers

2202
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:58,480
most common mistake of smart Engineers
 

2203
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,829
most common mistake of smart Engineers
is to optimize a thing that should not

2204
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:00,839
is to optimize a thing that should not
 

2205
00:46:00,839 --> 00:46:04,510
is to optimize a thing that should not
exist right so so like like you say you

2206
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:04,520
exist right so so like like you say you
 

2207
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,309
exist right so so like like you say you
run through the algorithm yeah and

2208
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:06,319
run through the algorithm yeah and
 

2209
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,309
run through the algorithm yeah and
basically show show up to a problem uh

2210
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:09,319
basically show show up to a problem uh
 

2211
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:11,430
basically show show up to a problem uh
show up to the the the superc computer

2212
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,440
show up to the the the superc computer
 

2213
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,190
show up to the the the superc computer
cluster and see the process and ask can

2214
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,200
cluster and see the process and ask can
 

2215
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,190
cluster and see the process and ask can
this be deleted yeah first try to delete

2216
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:16,200
this be deleted yeah first try to delete
 

2217
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,109
this be deleted yeah first try to delete
it um yeah yeah that's not easy to do no

2218
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:21,119
it um yeah yeah that's not easy to do no
 

2219
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,230
it um yeah yeah that's not easy to do no
and and actually

2220
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:23,240
and and actually
 

2221
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,109
and and actually
this what what generally makes people

2222
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:25,119
this what what generally makes people
 

2223
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,950
this what what generally makes people
uneasy is that you've got to at least at

2224
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:26,960
uneasy is that you've got to at least at
 

2225
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,870
uneasy is that you've got to at least at
least some of the things that you delete

2226
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
least some of the things that you delete
 

2227
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,549
least some of the things that you delete
you will put back in yeah but going back

2228
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:31,559
you will put back in yeah but going back
 

2229
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,790
you will put back in yeah but going back
to sort of where our lumic system can

2230
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:33,800
to sort of where our lumic system can
 

2231
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,150
to sort of where our lumic system can
steer us wrong is that um we tend to

2232
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
steer us wrong is that um we tend to
 

2233
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,549
steer us wrong is that um we tend to
remember uh with sometimes a jarring

2234
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:40,559
remember uh with sometimes a jarring
 

2235
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,390
remember uh with sometimes a jarring
level of pain uh where we where we

2236
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:43,400
level of pain uh where we where we
 

2237
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,109
level of pain uh where we where we
deleted something that we subsequently

2238
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:45,119
deleted something that we subsequently
 

2239
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,349
deleted something that we subsequently
needed yeah um and so people will

2240
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:48,359
needed yeah um and so people will
 

2241
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:49,750
needed yeah um and so people will
remember that one time they forgot to

2242
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
remember that one time they forgot to
 

2243
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,549
remember that one time they forgot to
put in this thing 3 years ago and that

2244
00:46:52,549 --> 00:46:52,559
put in this thing 3 years ago and that
 

2245
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,510
put in this thing 3 years ago and that
caused them trouble um and so they

2246
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,520
caused them trouble um and so they
 

2247
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,390
caused them trouble um and so they
overcorrect and then they put too much

2248
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:57,400
overcorrect and then they put too much
 

2249
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,589
overcorrect and then they put too much
stuff in there and over complicate

2250
00:46:58,589 --> 00:46:58,599
stuff in there and over complicate
 

2251
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:00,710
stuff in there and over complicate
things so you actually have to say no

2252
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:00,720
things so you actually have to say no
 

2253
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,190
things so you actually have to say no
we're deliberately going to delete

2254
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:03,200
we're deliberately going to delete
 

2255
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,670
we're deliberately going to delete
more than we we should so that we're

2256
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:06,680
more than we we should so that we're
 

2257
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,670
more than we we should so that we're
putting at least one in 10 things we're

2258
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:08,680
putting at least one in 10 things we're
 

2259
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,589
putting at least one in 10 things we're
going to add back

2260
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:10,599
going to add back
 

2261
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,390
going to add back
in and and I've seen you suggest just

2262
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:13,400
in and and I've seen you suggest just
 

2263
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,109
in and and I've seen you suggest just
that that something should be deleted

2264
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:16,119
that that something should be deleted
 

2265
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:18,870
that that something should be deleted
and you can kind of see the the pain oh

2266
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
and you can kind of see the the pain oh
 

2267
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,510
and you can kind of see the the pain oh
yeah absolutely everybody feels a little

2268
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:20,520
yeah absolutely everybody feels a little
 

2269
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,390
yeah absolutely everybody feels a little
bit of the pain absolutely and and I

2270
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
bit of the pain absolutely and and I
 

2271
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,750
bit of the pain absolutely and and I
tell them in advance like yeah there's

2272
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
tell them in advance like yeah there's
 

2273
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,030
tell them in advance like yeah there's
some of the things that we delete we're

2274
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,040
some of the things that we delete we're
 

2275
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,870
some of the things that we delete we're
going to put back in and and that people

2276
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:27,880
going to put back in and and that people
 

2277
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,750
going to put back in and and that people
get a little shook by that um but it

2278
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:30,760
get a little shook by that um but it
 

2279
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,670
get a little shook by that um but it
makes sense because if you if you're so

2280
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:32,680
makes sense because if you if you're so
 

2281
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,589
makes sense because if you if you're so
conservative as

2282
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:34,599
conservative as
 

2283
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:37,470
conservative as
to never have to put anything back in

2284
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:37,480
to never have to put anything back in
 

2285
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,870
to never have to put anything back in
you obviously have a lot of stuff that

2286
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:38,880
you obviously have a lot of stuff that
 

2287
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,829
you obviously have a lot of stuff that
isn't

2288
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:39,839
isn't
 

2289
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:43,349
isn't
needed so you got over correct this is I

2290
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:43,359
needed so you got over correct this is I
 

2291
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,910
needed so you got over correct this is I
would say like a cortical override to

2292
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:44,920
would say like a cortical override to
 

2293
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,910
would say like a cortical override to
Olympic

2294
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:45,920
Olympic
 

2295
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,430
Olympic
Instinct one of many that probably leads

2296
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:48,440
Instinct one of many that probably leads
 

2297
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,150
Instinct one of many that probably leads
us

2298
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:49,160
us
 

2299
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,910
us
astray yeah um there's like a step four

2300
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:52,920
astray yeah um there's like a step four
 

2301
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,270
astray yeah um there's like a step four
as well which is um any given thing can

2302
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,280
as well which is um any given thing can
 

2303
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,990
as well which is um any given thing can
be sped up

2304
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:58,000
be sped up
 

2305
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,589
be sped up
have a fast you think it can be done

2306
00:47:59,589 --> 00:47:59,599
have a fast you think it can be done
 

2307
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:00,950
have a fast you think it can be done
like whatever the speed the speed is

2308
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:00,960
like whatever the speed the speed is
 

2309
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,910
like whatever the speed the speed is
being done it can be done faster but but

2310
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:02,920
being done it can be done faster but but
 

2311
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,109
being done it can be done faster but but
you shouldn't speed things up until it's

2312
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:04,119
you shouldn't speed things up until it's
 

2313
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,549
you shouldn't speed things up until it's
off until you tried to delete it and

2314
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:05,559
off until you tried to delete it and
 

2315
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:07,030
off until you tried to delete it and
optimize it otherwise you're speeding up

2316
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:07,040
optimize it otherwise you're speeding up
 

2317
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,230
optimize it otherwise you're speeding up
something that speeding up something

2318
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240
something that speeding up something
 

2319
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,109
something that speeding up something
that shouldn't exist is absurd um and

2320
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:10,119
that shouldn't exist is absurd um and
 

2321
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:12,030
that shouldn't exist is absurd um and
then and then the the fifth thing is to

2322
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:12,040
then and then the the fifth thing is to
 

2323
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,950
then and then the the fifth thing is to
to automate it yeah and I've gone

2324
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:15,960
to automate it yeah and I've gone
 

2325
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,270
to automate it yeah and I've gone
backwards so many times where I've

2326
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
backwards so many times where I've
 

2327
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,950
backwards so many times where I've
automated something sped it up

2328
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:19,960
automated something sped it up
 

2329
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,829
automated something sped it up
simplified it and then deleted

2330
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:21,839
simplified it and then deleted
 

2331
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,549
simplified it and then deleted
it and I got tired of doing that so

2332
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:25,559
it and I got tired of doing that so
 

2333
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:27,230
it and I got tired of doing that so
that's why I've got this mantra that is

2334
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:27,240
that's why I've got this mantra that is
 

2335
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,270
that's why I've got this mantra that is
a very effective five-step process it

2336
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:30,280
a very effective five-step process it
 

2337
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,589
a very effective five-step process it
works great well when you've already

2338
00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:32,599
works great well when you've already
 

2339
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:35,790
works great well when you've already
automated deleting must be real painful

2340
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:35,800
automated deleting must be real painful
 

2341
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,750
automated deleting must be real painful
yeah great it's like it's like wow I

2342
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:38,760
yeah great it's like it's like wow I
 

2343
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,630
yeah great it's like it's like wow I
really wasted a lot of effort there yeah

2344
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:41,640
really wasted a lot of effort there yeah
 

2345
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,630
really wasted a lot of effort there yeah
I mean what you've done uh with the with

2346
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:43,640
I mean what you've done uh with the with
 

2347
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,870
I mean what you've done uh with the with
the cluster in uh Memphis is incredible

2348
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:45,880
the cluster in uh Memphis is incredible
 

2349
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,670
the cluster in uh Memphis is incredible
just in a handful of weeks yeah it's not

2350
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:48,680
just in a handful of weeks yeah it's not
 

2351
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,789
just in a handful of weeks yeah it's not
working yet so I want to pop the

2352
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:50,799
working yet so I want to pop the
 

2353
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:53,789
working yet so I want to pop the
champagne CS

2354
00:48:53,789 --> 00:48:53,799
champagne CS
 

2355
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:56,349
champagne CS
um in fact I have I have a a call in a

2356
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:56,359
um in fact I have I have a a call in a
 

2357
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:57,430
um in fact I have I have a a call in a
few hours

2358
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:57,440
few hours
 

2359
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,910
few hours
with the Memphis team um because we're

2360
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:00,920
with the Memphis team um because we're
 

2361
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,390
with the Memphis team um because we're
having some power fluctuation

2362
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:03,400
having some power fluctuation
 

2363
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,430
having some power fluctuation
issues

2364
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
issues
 

2365
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,430
issues
um so yes uh yeah it's like kind of a

2366
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:09,440
um so yes uh yeah it's like kind of a
 

2367
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,589
um so yes uh yeah it's like kind of a
there's a when you do synchronized

2368
00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:12,599
there's a when you do synchronized
 

2369
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,630
there's a when you do synchronized
training when you you have all these

2370
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,640
training when you you have all these
 

2371
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,109
training when you you have all these
computers that are training uh that

2372
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:17,119
computers that are training uh that
 

2373
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:18,910
computers that are training uh that
where the training is synchronized to

2374
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:18,920
where the training is synchronized to
 

2375
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,430
where the training is synchronized to
you know at the sort of millisecond

2376
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:20,440
you know at the sort of millisecond
 

2377
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,950
you know at the sort of millisecond
level uh you it's like having an

2378
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:23,960
level uh you it's like having an
 

2379
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,710
level uh you it's like having an
orchestra and and then the the the

2380
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:26,720
orchestra and and then the the the
 

2381
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,430
orchestra and and then the the the
Orchestra can go loud to silent very

2382
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,440
Orchestra can go loud to silent very
 

2383
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,430
Orchestra can go loud to silent very
quickly you know um subc level and then

2384
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:33,440
quickly you know um subc level and then
 

2385
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,230
quickly you know um subc level and then
the the electrical system kind of freaks

2386
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:35,240
the the electrical system kind of freaks
 

2387
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,789
the the electrical system kind of freaks
out about that like if if you suddenly

2388
00:49:36,789 --> 00:49:36,799
out about that like if if you suddenly
 

2389
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:40,349
out about that like if if you suddenly
see giant shifts 10 20 megawatts several

2390
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:40,359
see giant shifts 10 20 megawatts several
 

2391
00:49:40,359 --> 00:49:43,710
see giant shifts 10 20 megawatts several
times a second uh the this is not what

2392
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:43,720
times a second uh the this is not what
 

2393
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,109
times a second uh the this is not what
electrical systems are expecting to see

2394
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:46,119
electrical systems are expecting to see
 

2395
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:47,309
electrical systems are expecting to see
so that's one of the main things you

2396
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:47,319
so that's one of the main things you
 

2397
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:50,309
so that's one of the main things you
have to figure out the cooling the power

2398
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
have to figure out the cooling the power
 

2399
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,789
have to figure out the cooling the power
the uh and then on the software as you

2400
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:52,799
the uh and then on the software as you
 

2401
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:55,270
the uh and then on the software as you
go up the stack how to do the the

2402
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:55,280
go up the stack how to do the the
 

2403
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,390
go up the stack how to do the the
distributed Compu all that

2404
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:57,400
distributed Compu all that
 

2405
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,270
distributed Compu all that
today's problem is dealing with with

2406
00:49:59,270 --> 00:49:59,280
today's problem is dealing with with
 

2407
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,190
today's problem is dealing with with
with with extreme power

2408
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
with with extreme power
 

2409
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,150
with with extreme power
Jitter power Jitter yeah it's a nice

2410
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:04,160
Jitter power Jitter yeah it's a nice
 

2411
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,030
Jitter power Jitter yeah it's a nice
ring to that so that's okay and you

2412
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,040
ring to that so that's okay and you
 

2413
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,430
ring to that so that's okay and you
stayed up late into the night as you

2414
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:09,440
stayed up late into the night as you
 

2415
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,990
stayed up late into the night as you
often do there last week yeah last week

2416
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:13,000
often do there last week yeah last week
 

2417
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,030
often do there last week yeah last week
yeah yeah we finally finally got uh got

2418
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:16,040
yeah yeah we finally finally got uh got
 

2419
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,990
yeah yeah we finally finally got uh got
got training going at uh oddly enough

2420
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:19,000
got training going at uh oddly enough
 

2421
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,270
got training going at uh oddly enough
roughly 4 4:20 a.m. uh last

2422
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
roughly 4 4:20 a.m. uh last
 

2423
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,829
roughly 4 4:20 a.m. uh last
Monday total coincidence yeah I mean

2424
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:25,839
Monday total coincidence yeah I mean
 

2425
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,309
Monday total coincidence yeah I mean
maybe it was 422 something yeah yeah

2426
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
maybe it was 422 something yeah yeah
 

2427
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:29,910
maybe it was 422 something yeah yeah
it's that Universe again with the jokes

2428
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
it's that Universe again with the jokes
 

2429
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,109
it's that Universe again with the jokes
exactly just love it I mean I wonder if

2430
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:32,119
exactly just love it I mean I wonder if
 

2431
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:33,950
exactly just love it I mean I wonder if
you could speak to the the fact that you

2432
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:33,960
you could speak to the the fact that you
 

2433
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,510
you could speak to the the fact that you
one of the things uh that you did when I

2434
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:36,520
one of the things uh that you did when I
 

2435
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,750
one of the things uh that you did when I
was there is you went through all the

2436
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:37,760
was there is you went through all the
 

2437
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,390
was there is you went through all the
steps of what everybody's doing just to

2438
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:40,400
steps of what everybody's doing just to
 

2439
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,710
steps of what everybody's doing just to
get a sense that you yourself understand

2440
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
get a sense that you yourself understand
 

2441
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,750
get a sense that you yourself understand
it and uh

2442
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:44,760
it and uh
 

2443
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,829
it and uh
everybody understands it so they can

2444
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:46,839
everybody understands it so they can
 

2445
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,670
everybody understands it so they can
understand when something is dumb or

2446
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:48,680
understand when something is dumb or
 

2447
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,870
understand when something is dumb or
some something is inefficient or that

2448
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:50,880
some something is inefficient or that
 

2449
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,510
some something is inefficient or that
can you speak to that yeah so I like

2450
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:53,520
can you speak to that yeah so I like
 

2451
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,470
can you speak to that yeah so I like
like I try to do whatever the people at

2452
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:55,480
like I try to do whatever the people at
 

2453
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,870
like I try to do whatever the people at
the front lines are doing I try to do it

2454
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:56,880
the front lines are doing I try to do it
 

2455
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,190
the front lines are doing I try to do it
at least a few times myself so

2456
00:50:59,190 --> 00:50:59,200
at least a few times myself so
 

2457
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,990
at least a few times myself so

limiting factor for large training
 

2463
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,589
limiting factor for large training
clusters is the cabling there so many

2464
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:10,599
clusters is the cabling there so many
 

2465
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:14,470

the the whole thing is like one giant
 

2473
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:25,549
the the whole thing is like one giant
brain so if you've got

2474
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:25,559
brain so if you've got
 

2475
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:30,150
brain so if you've got
um any to any connection so it's the the

2476
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160
um any to any connection so it's the the
 

2477
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:34,230
um any to any connection so it's the the
any GPU can talk to any GPU out of

2481
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,030
100,000 that is a that is a crazy cable
out it looks pretty cool yeah it's like

2482
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,040
out it looks pretty cool yeah it's like
 

2483
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,349
out it looks pretty cool yeah it's like
it's like the human brain but like at a

2484
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:43,359
it's like the human brain but like at a
 

2485
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:46,390
it's like the human brain but like at a
scale that humans can visibly see it is

2486
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:46,400
scale that humans can visibly see it is
 

2487
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,109
scale that humans can visibly see it is
a brain I mean the human brain also has

2488
00:51:49,109 --> 00:51:49,119
a brain I mean the human brain also has
 

2489
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,829
a brain I mean the human brain also has
a massive amount of the brain tissue is

00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:51,839
a massive amount of the brain tissue is
 

2491
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,270
a massive amount of the brain tissue is
the the cables yeah so they get the gray

2492
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
the the cables yeah so they get the gray

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,470
cables big percentage of your brain is
just cables that's what it felt like

2500
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,480
just cables that's what it felt like
 

2501
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,589
just cables that's what it felt like
walking around in the supercomputer

2502
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:04,599
walking around in the supercomputer
 

2503
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:06,190
walking around in the supercomputer
center it's like we're walking around

2504
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:06,200
center it's like we're walking around
 

2505
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,630
center it's like we're walking around
inside a brain they will one day build a

2506
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:09,640
inside a brain they will one day build a
 

2507
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,829
inside a brain they will one day build a
super intelligent super super

2508
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:11,839
super intelligent super super
 

2509
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,870
super intelligent super super
intelligent system do you think yeah do

2510
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:13,880
intelligent system do you think yeah do
 

2511
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,030
intelligent system do you think yeah do
you think there's a chance that xai that

2512
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:18,040
you think there's a chance that xai that
 

2513
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,870
you think there's a chance that xai that
you are the one that builds

2514
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:20,880
you are the one that builds
 

2515
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,109
you are the one that builds
AGI um it's

2516
00:52:24,109 --> 00:52:24,119
AGI um it's
 

2517
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,150
AGI um it's
possible where do you define as AGI

2518
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,160
possible where do you define as AGI
 

2519
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,270
possible where do you define as AGI
I think humans will

2520
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:30,280
I think humans will
 

2521
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,470
I think humans will
never acknowledge that AGI has been

2522
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,480
never acknowledge that AGI has been
 

2523
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,630
never acknowledge that AGI has been
built keep moving the go Post Yeah so uh

2524
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:35,640
built keep moving the go Post Yeah so uh
 

2525
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,990
built keep moving the go Post Yeah so uh
I think there's already superhuman

2526
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,000
I think there's already superhuman
 

2527
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,870
I think there's already superhuman
capabilities that are available uh in AI

2528
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:40,880
capabilities that are available uh in AI
 

2529
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,069
capabilities that are available uh in AI
systems I think I think what AI is is

2530
00:52:43,069 --> 00:52:43,079
systems I think I think what AI is is
 

2531
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:45,430
systems I think I think what AI is is
when it's smarter than the collective

2532
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:45,440
when it's smarter than the collective
 

2533
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,549
when it's smarter than the collective
intelligence of the entire human

2534
00:52:47,549 --> 00:52:47,559
intelligence of the entire human
 

2535
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:49,670
intelligence of the entire human
species in AR well I think that yeah

2536
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:49,680
species in AR well I think that yeah
 

2537
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,390
species in AR well I think that yeah
that appear would call that sort of ASI

2538
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
that appear would call that sort of ASI
 

2539
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,549
that appear would call that sort of ASI
artificial super intelligence um but

2540
00:52:55,549 --> 00:52:55,559
artificial super intelligence um but
 

2541
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,109
artificial super intelligence um but
there are these thresholds where um you

2542
00:52:58,109 --> 00:52:58,119
there are these thresholds where um you
 

2543
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:01,230
there are these thresholds where um you
say at some point um the AI is smarter

2544
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:01,240
say at some point um the AI is smarter
 

2545
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,950
say at some point um the AI is smarter
than any single human um and then then

2546
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:03,960
than any single human um and then then
 

2547
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,349
than any single human um and then then
you got 8 billion humans so um and and

2548
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:07,359
you got 8 billion humans so um and and
 

2549
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,190
you got 8 billion humans so um and and
actually each human is machine augmented

2550
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:10,200
actually each human is machine augmented
 

2551
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,990
actually each human is machine augmented
by the computers right so you've got so

2552
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:13,000
by the computers right so you've got so
 

2553
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,430
by the computers right so you've got so
it's a much higher bar to compete with u

2554
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440
it's a much higher bar to compete with u
 

2555
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,870
it's a much higher bar to compete with u
8 billion machine augmented

2556
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:17,880
8 billion machine augmented
 

2557
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,829
8 billion machine augmented
humans that's you know whole bunch of

2558
00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:20,839
humans that's you know whole bunch of
 

2559
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:24,430
humans that's you know whole bunch of
orders magnitude more

2560
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:24,440
orders magnitude more
 

2561
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,950
orders magnitude more
so but but at a certain

2562
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:26,960
so but but at a certain
 

2563
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,349
so but but at a certain
yeah the AI will be smarter than all

2564
00:53:30,349 --> 00:53:30,359
yeah the AI will be smarter than all
 

2565
00:53:30,359 --> 00:53:32,990
yeah the AI will be smarter than all
humans combined if you are the one to do

2566
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:33,000
humans combined if you are the one to do
 

2567
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,349
humans combined if you are the one to do
it do you feel the responsibility of

2568
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:34,359
it do you feel the responsibility of
 

2569
00:53:34,359 --> 00:53:36,030
it do you feel the responsibility of
that

2570
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:36,040
that
 

2571
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,789
that
yeah

2572
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:37,799
yeah
 

2573
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:41,630
yeah
absolutely and and I I want to be clear

2574
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:41,640
absolutely and and I I want to be clear
 

2575
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:45,710
absolutely and and I I want to be clear
like let's say if if if xai is first the

2576
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:45,720
like let's say if if if xai is first the
 

2577
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,670
like let's say if if if xai is first the
others won't be far

2578
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:47,680
others won't be far
 

2579
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,710
others won't be far
behind I mean that might be Sixx months

2580
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:50,720
behind I mean that might be Sixx months
 

2581
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,190
behind I mean that might be Sixx months
behind or a year maybe not even that so

2582
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:54,200
behind or a year maybe not even that so
 

2583
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,150
behind or a year maybe not even that so
how do you do it in a way that that uh

2584
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:56,160
how do you do it in a way that that uh
 

2585
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,549
how do you do it in a way that that uh
doesn't doesn't hurt Humanity do you

2586
00:53:59,549 --> 00:53:59,559
doesn't doesn't hurt Humanity do you
 

2587
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:02,069
doesn't doesn't hurt Humanity do you
think so I mean I thought about AI for a

2588
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:02,079
think so I mean I thought about AI for a
 

2589
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,789
think so I mean I thought about AI for a
long time and the the the thing that at

2590
00:54:04,789 --> 00:54:04,799
long time and the the the thing that at
 

2591
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,030
long time and the the the thing that at
least my biological neuronet comes up

2592
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:07,040
least my biological neuronet comes up
 

2593
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,230
least my biological neuronet comes up
with as being the most important thing

2594
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:09,240
with as being the most important thing
 

2595
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,030
with as being the most important thing
is um adherence to truth whether that

2596
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,040
is um adherence to truth whether that
 

2597
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,309
is um adherence to truth whether that
truth is uh politically correct or not

2598
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
truth is uh politically correct or not
 

2599
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,870
truth is uh politically correct or not
um

2600
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:17,880
um
 

2601
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,950
um
so I think if you if you if you force AI

2602
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
so I think if you if you if you force AI
 

2603
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,470
so I think if you if you if you force AI
to lie or train them to lie you're

2604
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:22,480
to lie or train them to lie you're
 

2605
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,710
to lie or train them to lie you're
really asking for trouble um even if

2606
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
really asking for trouble um even if
 

2607
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,710
really asking for trouble um even if
that that lie is done with good

2608
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:27,720
that that lie is done with good
 

2609
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,430
that that lie is done with good
intentions um so I you saw sort of

2610
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:32,440
intentions um so I you saw sort of
 

2611
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,510
intentions um so I you saw sort of
um issues with ch tvt and Gemini and

2612
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:36,520
um issues with ch tvt and Gemini and
 

2613
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,109
um issues with ch tvt and Gemini and
whatnot like you ask Gemini for an image

2614
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:39,119
whatnot like you ask Gemini for an image
 

2615
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,710
whatnot like you ask Gemini for an image
of the founding part of the United

2616
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:40,720
of the founding part of the United
 

2617
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,309
of the founding part of the United
States and it shows a group of diverse

2618
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:42,319
States and it shows a group of diverse
 

2619
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:47,670
States and it shows a group of diverse
women now that's factually untrue um so

2620
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:47,680
women now that's factually untrue um so
 

2621
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,950
women now that's factually untrue um so
um now that that's sort of like a silly

2622
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:49,960
um now that that's sort of like a silly
 

2623
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,710
um now that that's sort of like a silly
thing but uh if if if an AI is

2624
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:53,720
thing but uh if if if an AI is
 

2625
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,230
thing but uh if if if an AI is
programmed to say like diversity is a

2626
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:55,240
programmed to say like diversity is a
 

2627
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,589
programmed to say like diversity is a
necessary out output function and it

2628
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:57,599
necessary out output function and it
 

2629
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,349
necessary out output function and it
then it becomes Omni sort of this Omni

2630
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:00,359
then it becomes Omni sort of this Omni
 

2631
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:03,230
then it becomes Omni sort of this Omni
powerful uh intelligence it could say

2632
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:03,240
powerful uh intelligence it could say
 

2633
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:06,230
powerful uh intelligence it could say
okay well diversity is now required uh

2634
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
okay well diversity is now required uh
 

2635
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,549
okay well diversity is now required uh
and and if there's not enough diversity

2636
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:08,559
and and if there's not enough diversity
 

2637
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,910
and and if there's not enough diversity
those who don't fit the diversity

2638
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:10,920
those who don't fit the diversity
 

2639
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,390
those who don't fit the diversity
requirements will be

2640
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:12,400
requirements will be
 

2641
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,670
requirements will be
executed if it's programmed to do that

2642
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:14,680
executed if it's programmed to do that
 

2643
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,710
executed if it's programmed to do that
as the fundamental go the fundamental

2644
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:16,720
as the fundamental go the fundamental
 

2645
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,630
as the fundamental go the fundamental
utility function it will do whatever it

2646
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:18,640
utility function it will do whatever it
 

2647
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,710
utility function it will do whatever it
takes to achieve that so you have to be

2648
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:20,720
takes to achieve that so you have to be
 

2649
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,190
takes to achieve that so you have to be
very careful about that um that that's

2650
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:23,200
very careful about that um that that's
 

2651
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,990
very careful about that um that that's
where I think you want to just be

2652
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,000
where I think you want to just be
 

2653
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,750
where I think you want to just be
truthful

2654
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:26,760

me that is insane but if you've got that

2674
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:51,720
me that is insane but if you've got that
 

2675
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,829
me that is insane but if you've got that
kind of thing programmed in it could you

2676
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:54,839
kind of thing programmed in it could you
 

2677
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:56,750
kind of thing programmed in it could you
know the AI could conclude something

2678
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:56,760
know the AI could conclude something
 

2679
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,109
know the AI could conclude something
absolutely insane like it's better in

all humans must die because that then

2684
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:05,160
all humans must die because that then
 

2685
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,789
all humans must die because that then
that misgendering is no not possible

2686
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
that misgendering is no not possible
 

2687
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:10,670
that misgendering is no not possible
because they're no humans um there are

2688
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:10,680
because they're no humans um there are
 

2689
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,710
because they're no humans um there are
these absurd uh things that are

2690
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:13,720
these absurd uh things that are
 

2691
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,109
these absurd uh things that are
nonetheless logical if that's what you

2692
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:15,119
nonetheless logical if that's what you
 

2693
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:19,910
nonetheless logical if that's what you
programmed it to do um so you know um in

2694
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
programmed it to do um so you know um in
 

2695
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,270

2001 Space Odyssey what oy clar was

2696
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:22,280
2001 Space Odyssey what oy clar was
 

2697
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,670
2001 Space Odyssey what oy clar was
trying to say or one of the things he

2698
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:23,680
trying to say or one of the things he
 

2699
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,829
trying to say or one of the things he
was trying to say there was that you

2700
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:25,839
was trying to say there was that you
 

2701
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:29,630
was trying to say there was that you
should not program AI to lie cuz um

2702
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:29,640
should not program AI to lie cuz um
 

2703
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,069
should not program AI to lie cuz um
essentially the the the AI Hell 9000 was

2704
00:56:33,069 --> 00:56:33,079
essentially the the the AI Hell 9000 was
 

2705
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:36,270
essentially the the the AI Hell 9000 was
programmed to it was told to take the

2706
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:36,280
programmed to it was told to take the
 

2707
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,470
programmed to it was told to take the
astronauts to the monolith um but also

2708
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:39,480
astronauts to the monolith um but also
 

2709
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,589
astronauts to the monolith um but also
they could not know about the

2710
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:41,599
they could not know about the
 

2711
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,950
they could not know about the
monolith so it concluded that uh it will

2712
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:44,960
monolith so it concluded that uh it will
 

2713
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,510
monolith so it concluded that uh it will
just take it will kill them and take

2714
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:47,520
just take it will kill them and take
 

2715
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,270
just take it will kill them and take
them to the monolith thus they it

2716
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
them to the monolith thus they it
 

2717
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,470
them to the monolith thus they it
brought them to the monolith they're

2718
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:50,480
brought them to the monolith they're
 

2719
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,510
brought them to the monolith they're
dead but they do not know about the

2720
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:51,520
dead but they do not know about the
 

2721
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,789
dead but they do not know about the
monolith problem solved that is why it

2722
00:56:53,789 --> 00:56:53,799
monolith problem solved that is why it
 

2723
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:56,750
monolith problem solved that is why it

truth that I think is dangerous right

2810
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:32,880
truth that I think is dangerous right
 

2811
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:35,109
truth that I think is dangerous right
like yeah injecting our own human biases

2812
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:35,119
like yeah injecting our own human biases
 

2813
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,150
like yeah injecting our own human biases
into the thing yeah but you know that's

2814
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:37,160
into the thing yeah but you know that's
 

2815
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,789
into the thing yeah but you know that's
where it's a difficult engineering

2816
00:58:38,789 --> 00:58:38,799
where it's a difficult engineering
 

2817
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:39,870
where it's a difficult engineering
software engineering problem because you

2818
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:39,880
software engineering problem because you
 

2819
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,190
software engineering problem because you
have to select the data correctly have

2820
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:41,200
have to select the data correctly have
 

2821
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,950
have to select the data correctly have
to it's it's hard well the and the

2822
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:44,960
to it's it's hard well the and the
 

2823
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,510
to it's it's hard well the and the
internet at this point is polluted with

2824
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:46,520
internet at this point is polluted with
 

2825
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:49,589
internet at this point is polluted with
so much AI generated data it's insane so

2826
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:49,599
so much AI generated data it's insane so
 

2827
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,430
so much AI generated data it's insane so
you have to

2828
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:51,440
you have to
 

2829
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,549
you have to
actually you know like there's a a thing

2830
00:58:53,549 --> 00:58:53,559
actually you know like there's a a thing
 

2831
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:55,630
actually you know like there's a a thing
now if you want to search the internet

2832
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:55,640
now if you want to search the internet
 

2833
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,829
now if you want to search the internet
you you can say Google but uh exclude

2834
00:58:58,829 --> 00:58:58,839
you you can say Google but uh exclude
 

2835
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:00,270
you you can say Google but uh exclude
anything after

2836
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:00,280
anything after
 

2837
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,510
anything after
2023 it will actually often give you

2838
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:02,520
2023 it will actually often give you
 

2839
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,710
2023 it will actually often give you
better results yeah um because there

2840
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
better results yeah um because there
 

2841
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,870
better results yeah um because there
this so much the explosion of AI

2842
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:07,880
this so much the explosion of AI
 

2843
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:12,230
this so much the explosion of AI
generated materialis is crazy so like in

2844
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:12,240
generated materialis is crazy so like in
 

2845
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,270
generated materialis is crazy so like in
training grock um we have to go through

2846
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:16,280
training grock um we have to go through
 

2847
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,390
training grock um we have to go through
the data and say like hey we actually

2848
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:18,400
the data and say like hey we actually
 

2849
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,870
the data and say like hey we actually
have to have sort of apply AI to the

2850
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:21,880
have to have sort of apply AI to the
 

2851
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,349
have to have sort of apply AI to the
data to say is this data most likely

2852
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:24,359
data to say is this data most likely
 

2853
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:25,710
data to say is this data most likely
correct or most likely not before we

2854
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:25,720
correct or most likely not before we
 

2855
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,390
correct or most likely not before we
feed it into the training system that's

2856
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:28,400
feed it into the training system that's
 

2857
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,230
feed it into the training system that's
crazy yeah so and is it generated by

2858
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:31,240
crazy yeah so and is it generated by
 

2859
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,870
crazy yeah so and is it generated by
human is yeah I mean that the the data

2860
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:33,880
human is yeah I mean that the the data
 

2861
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,029
human is yeah I mean that the the data
the the data filtration process is

2862
00:59:36,029 --> 00:59:36,039
the the data filtration process is
 

2863
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,910
the the data filtration process is
extremely extremely difficult yeah do

2864
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:38,920
extremely extremely difficult yeah do
 

2865
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,710
extremely extremely difficult yeah do
you think it's possible to have a a

2866
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:40,720
you think it's possible to have a a
 

2867
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,390
you think it's possible to have a a
serious objective rigorous political

2868
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:43,400
serious objective rigorous political
 

2869
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,630
serious objective rigorous political
discussion with grock uh like for a long

2870
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:46,640
discussion with grock uh like for a long
 

2871
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,349
discussion with grock uh like for a long
time and it wouldn't like grock three or

2872
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:48,359
time and it wouldn't like grock three or
 

2873
00:59:48,359 --> 00:59:49,789
time and it wouldn't like grock three or
grock four three is going to be next

2874
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:49,799
grock four three is going to be next
 

2875
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,990
grock four three is going to be next
level I mean what people are currently

2876
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
level I mean what people are currently
 

2877
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,230
level I mean what people are currently
seeing with Croc is is kind of baby groc

2878
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:54,240
seeing with Croc is is kind of baby groc
 

2879
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,109
seeing with Croc is is kind of baby groc
yeah baby Gro it's baby groc right now

2880
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,119
yeah baby Gro it's baby groc right now
 

2881
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,750
yeah baby Gro it's baby groc right now
um but baby gr's still pretty good um so

2882
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:00,760
um but baby gr's still pretty good um so
 

2883
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,390
um but baby gr's still pretty good um so
it's uh but it's an order of magnitude

2884
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
it's uh but it's an order of magnitude
 

2885
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,230
it's uh but it's an order of magnitude
less sophisticated than GPD full you

2886
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:05,240
less sophisticated than GPD full you
 

2887
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,549
less sophisticated than GPD full you
know it's now Gro 2 which finished

2888
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:08,559
know it's now Gro 2 which finished
 

2889
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:10,549
know it's now Gro 2 which finished
training I don't

2890
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:10,559
training I don't
 

2891
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,109
training I don't
know six weeks go their their AMS um

2892
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
know six weeks go their their AMS um
 

2893
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,710
know six weeks go their their AMS um
grock 2 will be a giant Improvement and

2894
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:17,720
grock 2 will be a giant Improvement and
 

2895
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,430
grock 2 will be a giant Improvement and
then grock 3 will be I don't know order

2896
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:20,440
then grock 3 will be I don't know order
 

2897
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,670
then grock 3 will be I don't know order
magnitude better than grock 2 and you're

2898
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:22,680
magnitude better than grock 2 and you're
 

2899
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,390
magnitude better than grock 2 and you're
hoping for it to be like state-ofthe-art

2900
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:24,400
hoping for it to be like state-ofthe-art
 

2901
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,549
hoping for it to be like state-ofthe-art
like better than hopefully I mean this

2902
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559
like better than hopefully I mean this
 

2903
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,710
like better than hopefully I mean this
is a goal I mean we may fail at this

2904
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:28,720
is a goal I mean we may fail at this
 

2905
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,430
is a goal I mean we may fail at this
goal that is that's the aspiration do

2906
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:32,440
goal that is that's the aspiration do
 

2907
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,589
goal that is that's the aspiration do
you think it matters who builds the AGI

2908
01:00:35,589 --> 01:00:35,599
you think it matters who builds the AGI
 

2909
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,750

the the people and how they think and

2910
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:37,760
the the people and how they think and
 

2911
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,829
the the people and how they think and
how they structure their companies and

01:00:39,829 --> 01:00:39,839
how they structure their companies and
 

2913
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,510
how they structure their companies and
all that kind of stuff uh yeah I think

2914
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:42,520
all that kind of stuff uh yeah I think
 

2915
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:45,390
all that kind of stuff uh yeah I think
it matters that there is a I I think

2916
01:00:45,390 --> 01:00:45,400
it matters that there is a I I think
 

2917
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,470
it matters that there is a I I think
it's important that that whatever AI

2918
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,480
it's important that that whatever AI
 

2919
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,630
it's important that that whatever AI
wins is a maximum truth seeking AI that

2920
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:50,640
wins is a maximum truth seeking AI that
 

2921
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,589
wins is a maximum truth seeking AI that
is not force to lie for political

2922
01:00:54,589 --> 01:00:54,599
is not force to lie for political
 

2923
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:57,710
is not force to lie for political
correctness for any reason really um

2924
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:57,720
correctness for any reason really um
 

2925
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,430
correctness for any reason really um
political anything

2926
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
political anything
 

2927
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,430
political anything
um I I am concerned

2928
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:04,440
um I I am concerned
 

2929
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:08,430
um I I am concerned
about AI succeeding that is that that

2930
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:08,440
about AI succeeding that is that that
 

2931
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,589
about AI succeeding that is that that
has got that is programmed to lie even

2932
01:01:10,589 --> 01:01:10,599
has got that is programmed to lie even
 

2933
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:12,750
has got that is programmed to lie even
in even in small

2934
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:12,760
in even in small
 

2935
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,430
in even in small
ways right because in small ways becomes

2936
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:16,440
ways right because in small ways becomes
 

2937
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,390
ways right because in small ways becomes
big ways when it's become very big ways

2938
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,400
big ways when it's become very big ways
 

2939
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,349
big ways when it's become very big ways
yeah and when it's used more and more at

2940
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:20,359
yeah and when it's used more and more at
 

2941
01:01:20,359 --> 01:01:25,190
yeah and when it's used more and more at
scale by humans yeah uh since I am

2942
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,200
scale by humans yeah uh since I am
 

2943
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,029
scale by humans yeah uh since I am
interviewing Donald Trump cool you want

2944
01:01:28,029 --> 01:01:28,039
interviewing Donald Trump cool you want
 

2945
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:30,589
interviewing Donald Trump cool you want
to stop by yeah sure I'll stop in there

2946
01:01:30,589 --> 01:01:30,599
to stop by yeah sure I'll stop in there
 

2947
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:32,950
to stop by yeah sure I'll stop in there

01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:06,039
determined by by these fundamental Tides
 

3121
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:07,549
determined by by these fundamental Tides
or is it determined by the captain of

3122
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:07,559
or is it determined by the captain of
 

3123
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:10,789
or is it determined by the captain of
the ship both really I mean there are

3124
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
the ship both really I mean there are
 

3125
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:12,630
the ship both really I mean there are
tides in the but it also matters who's

3126
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:12,640
tides in the but it also matters who's
 

3127
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,349
tides in the but it also matters who's
captain of the

3128
01:05:14,349 --> 01:05:14,359
captain of the
 

3129
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:17,549
captain of the
ship so so it's false dichotomy

3130
01:05:17,549 --> 01:05:17,559
ship so so it's false dichotomy
 

3131
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:19,789
ship so so it's false dichotomy
essentially

3132
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:19,799
essentially
 

3133
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:23,029
essentially
there's you but I mean there are

3134
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:23,039
there's you but I mean there are
 

3135
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,549
there's you but I mean there are
certainly tide the tides of History are

3136
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:26,559
certainly tide the tides of History are
 

3137
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:27,870
certainly tide the tides of History are
there are there are real tides of

3138
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:27,880
there are there are real tides of
 

3139
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:29,390
there are there are real tides of
history and these these tides are often

3140
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:29,400
history and these these tides are often
 

3141
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,710
history and these these tides are often
technologically driven if you say like

3142
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:31,720
technologically driven if you say like
 

3143
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,589
technologically driven if you say like

3148
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:42,200
result of a printing press that that was
 

3149
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,670
result of a printing press that that was
a massive tide of

3150
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:44,680
a massive tide of
 

3151
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:48,750
a massive tide of
history independent of any ruler but you

3152

history independent of any ruler but you
 

3153

best possible captain of the ship well

3156
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:54,480
best possible captain of the ship well
 

3157
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,670
best possible captain of the ship well
first of all thank you for recommending

3158
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
first of all thank you for recommending
 

3159

first of all thank you for recommending
remending uh will and Ariel Durant's

01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
remending uh will and Ariel Durant's
 

3161
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,870
remending uh will and Ariel Durant's
work I've read the short one for now

3162
01:06:01,870 --> 01:06:01,880
work I've read the short one for now
 

3163
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,150
work I've read the short one for now
lessons of lessons of History so one of

3164
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:04,160
lessons of lessons of History so one of
 

3165
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,990
lessons of lessons of History so one of
the one of the lessons one of the things

3166
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,000
the one of the lessons one of the things
 

3167
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,549
the one of the lessons one of the things
they highlight is the importance of

3168
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
they highlight is the importance of
 

3169
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,789
they highlight is the importance of
technology uh technological innovation

3170
01:06:10,789 --> 01:06:10,799
technology uh technological innovation
 

3171
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:12,829
technology uh technological innovation
and they which is funny because they've

3172
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:12,839
and they which is funny because they've
 

3173
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:15,430
and they which is funny because they've
written they wrote so long ago but they

3174
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:15,440
written they wrote so long ago but they
 

3175
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,990
written they wrote so long ago but they
were noticing that the the rate of

3176
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:18,000
were noticing that the the rate of
 

3177
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,870
were noticing that the the rate of
technological innovations was speeding

3178
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:19,880
technological innovations was speeding
 

3179
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:22,950
technological innovations was speeding
up um yeah I would

3180
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
up um yeah I would
 

3181
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,269
up um yeah I would
love to see what they think about now

3182
01:06:26,269 --> 01:06:26,279
love to see what they think about now
 

3183
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:29,430
love to see what they think about now
uh but yeah so did to me the question is

3184
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:29,440
uh but yeah so did to me the question is
 

3185
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,510
uh but yeah so did to me the question is
how much government how much politicians

3186
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:31,520
how much government how much politicians
 

3187
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,910
how much government how much politicians
get in the way of technological

3188
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:32,920
get in the way of technological
 

3189
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,910
get in the way of technological
innovation building versus like help it

3190
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:34,920
innovation building versus like help it
 

3191
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,549
innovation building versus like help it
and which which which politicians which

3192
01:06:37,549 --> 01:06:37,559
and which which which politicians which
 

3193
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:39,109
and which which which politicians which
kind of policies help technological

3194
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:39,119
kind of policies help technological
 

3195
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,750
kind of policies help technological
innovation because that seems to be if

3196
01:06:40,750 --> 01:06:40,760
innovation because that seems to be if
 

3197
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:41,990
innovation because that seems to be if
you look at human history that's an

3198
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
you look at human history that's an
 

3199
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,710
you look at human history that's an
important component of Empires rising

3200
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:44,720
important component of Empires rising
 

3201
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,549
important component of Empires rising
and

3202
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:45,559
and
 

3203
01:06:45,559 --> 01:06:49,589
and
succeeding yeah well I mean in terms of

3204
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:49,599
succeeding yeah well I mean in terms of
 

3205
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:50,910
succeeding yeah well I mean in terms of
dating civilization the start of

3206
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:50,920
dating civilization the start of
 

3207
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,589
dating civilization the start of
civilization I think the start of

3208
01:06:52,589 --> 01:06:52,599
civilization I think the start of
 

3209
01:06:52,599 --> 01:06:56,670
civilization I think the start of
writing in my view is is the

3210
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:56,680
writing in my view is is the
 

3211
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,069
writing in my view is is the
that's that's my what I think is

3212
01:06:58,069 --> 01:06:58,079
that's that's my what I think is
 

3213
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,470
that's that's my what I think is
probably the the right starting point to

3214
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:00,480
probably the the right starting point to
 

3215
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,349
probably the the right starting point to
date civilization and from that

3216
01:07:02,349 --> 01:07:02,359
date civilization and from that
 

3217
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:04,029
date civilization and from that
standpoint civilization has been around

3218
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:04,039
standpoint civilization has been around
 

3219
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:08,430
standpoint civilization has been around
for about 5,500 years um when writing

3220
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:08,440
for about 5,500 years um when writing
 

3221
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:11,789
for about 5,500 years um when writing
was invented by the ancient samarians um

3222
01:07:11,789 --> 01:07:11,799
was invented by the ancient samarians um
 

3223
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:13,789
was invented by the ancient samarians um
who who are gone now um but the the

3224
01:07:13,789 --> 01:07:13,799
who who are gone now um but the the
 

3225
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:15,870
who who are gone now um but the the
ancient samarians in terms of getting a

3226
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:15,880
ancient samarians in terms of getting a
 

3227
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,710
ancient samarians in terms of getting a
lot of Firsts the those ancient

3228
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:17,720
lot of Firsts the those ancient
 

3229
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,390
lot of Firsts the those ancient
samarians really have a long list of

3230
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,400
samarians really have a long list of
 

3231
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,349
samarians really have a long list of
Firsts it's pretty wild um in fact

3232
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
Firsts it's pretty wild um in fact
 

3233
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:24,750
Firsts it's pretty wild um in fact
Durant goes through the list of like you

3234
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:24,760
Durant goes through the list of like you
 

3235
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,349
Durant goes through the list of like you
want to see first we'll show you first

3236
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
want to see first we'll show you first
 

3237
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,309
want to see first we'll show you first
um the samarians just as were just ass

3238
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:30,319
um the samarians just as were just ass
 

3239
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,029
um the samarians just as were just ass
kickers um and then the Egyptians who

3240
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:33,039
kickers um and then the Egyptians who
 

3241
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:35,390
kickers um and then the Egyptians who
were right next door um relatively

3242
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:35,400
were right next door um relatively
 

3243
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,349
were right next door um relatively
speaking um they're like weren't that

3244
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:37,359
speaking um they're like weren't that
 

3245
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:40,470
speaking um they're like weren't that
far developed an entirely different form

3246
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:40,480
far developed an entirely different form
 

3247
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:43,549
far developed an entirely different form
of writing the hieroglyphics uniform and

3248
01:07:43,549 --> 01:07:43,559
of writing the hieroglyphics uniform and
 

3249
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,190
of writing the hieroglyphics uniform and
hieroglyphics totally different and you

3250
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:45,200
hieroglyphics totally different and you
 

3251
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:46,789
hieroglyphics totally different and you
can actually see the evolution of both

3252
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:46,799
can actually see the evolution of both
 

3253
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:49,470
can actually see the evolution of both
hieroglyphics and uniform like the

3254
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:49,480
hieroglyphics and uniform like the
 

3255
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,069
hieroglyphics and uniform like the
uniform starts off being very simple and

3256
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:52,079
uniform starts off being very simple and
 

3257
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:53,510
uniform starts off being very simple and
then it gets more complicated and then

3258
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:53,520
then it gets more complicated and then
 

3259
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,269
then it gets more complicated and then
towards the end it's like wow okay it

3260
01:07:55,269 --> 01:07:55,279
towards the end it's like wow okay it
 

3261
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:56,789
towards the end it's like wow okay it
really get very sophisticated with the

3262
01:07:56,789 --> 01:07:56,799
really get very sophisticated with the
 

3263
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,390
really get very sophisticated with the
uniform so I I think of civilization is

3264
01:07:59,390 --> 01:07:59,400
uniform so I I think of civilization is
 

3265
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,309
uniform so I I think of civilization is
being about 5,000 years old um and Earth

3266
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
being about 5,000 years old um and Earth
 

3267
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:06,589
being about 5,000 years old um and Earth
is um if physics is correct 4 and a half

3268
01:08:06,589 --> 01:08:06,599
is um if physics is correct 4 and a half
 

3269
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:09,029
is um if physics is correct 4 and a half
billion years old so civilization has

3270
01:08:09,029 --> 01:08:09,039
billion years old so civilization has
 

3271
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,510
billion years old so civilization has
been around for 1 millionth of us

3272
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:10,520
been around for 1 millionth of us
 

3273
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,750
been around for 1 millionth of us
existence flash in the pan yeah these

3274
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:13,760
existence flash in the pan yeah these
 

3275
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,990
existence flash in the pan yeah these
are the early early days and so we we we

3276
01:08:16,990 --> 01:08:17,000
are the early early days and so we we we
 

3277
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,630
are the early early days and so we we we
make it very dramatic because there's

3278
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:18,640
make it very dramatic because there's
 

3279
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,470
make it very dramatic because there's
been Rises and Falls of

3280
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:21,480
been Rises and Falls of
 

3281
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,669
been Rises and Falls of
Empires and many so many so many Rises

3282
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:24,679
Empires and many so many so many Rises
 

3283
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:26,829
Empires and many so many so many Rises
and Falls of empir

3284
01:08:26,829 --> 01:08:26,839
and Falls of empir
 

3285
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:27,630
and Falls of empir
so

3286
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:27,640
so
 

3287
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,269
so
many and there'll be many more yeah

3288
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:31,279
many and there'll be many more yeah
 

3289
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:33,510
many and there'll be many more yeah
exactly I mean only a tiny fraction

3290
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:33,520
exactly I mean only a tiny fraction
 

3291
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,269
exactly I mean only a tiny fraction
probably less than 1% of of what was

3292
01:08:36,269 --> 01:08:36,279
probably less than 1% of of what was
 

3293
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,030
probably less than 1% of of what was
ever written in history is is available

3294
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:39,040
ever written in history is is available
 

3295
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,430
ever written in history is is available
to us now I mean if they didn't put it

3296
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:40,440
to us now I mean if they didn't put it
 

3297
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,189
to us now I mean if they didn't put it
literally chisel it in stone or put it

3298
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:42,199
literally chisel it in stone or put it
 

3299
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:44,910
literally chisel it in stone or put it
in a clay tablet we don't have it I mean

3300
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:44,920
in a clay tablet we don't have it I mean
 

3301
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,630
in a clay tablet we don't have it I mean
there's some small amount of like

3302
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:46,640
there's some small amount of like
 

3303
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:48,829
there's some small amount of like
Papyrus Scrolls that were recovered that

3304
01:08:48,829 --> 01:08:48,839
Papyrus Scrolls that were recovered that
 

3305
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:50,870
Papyrus Scrolls that were recovered that
are thousands of years old uh because

3306
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:50,880
are thousands of years old uh because
 

3307
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,870
are thousands of years old uh because
they were deep inside a pyramid

3308
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:52,880
they were deep inside a pyramid
 

3309
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,149
they were deep inside a pyramid
and weren't affected by moisture

3310
01:08:56,149 --> 01:08:56,159
and weren't affected by moisture
 

3311
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:57,789
and weren't affected by moisture
uh but but but other than that it's

3312
01:08:57,789 --> 01:08:57,799
uh but but but other than that it's
 

3313
01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:00,189
uh but but but other than that it's
really got to be in a clay tablet or

3314
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:00,199
really got to be in a clay tablet or
 

3315
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:02,550
really got to be in a clay tablet or
chiseled so the vast majority of stuff

3316
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:02,560
chiseled so the vast majority of stuff
 

3317
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,669
chiseled so the vast majority of stuff
was not chiseled because you it takes a

3318
01:09:04,669 --> 01:09:04,679
was not chiseled because you it takes a
 

3319
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:08,349
was not chiseled because you it takes a
while to Chisel things um so that's

3320
01:09:08,349 --> 01:09:08,359
while to Chisel things um so that's
 

3321
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:10,269
while to Chisel things um so that's
where we've got a tiny tiny fraction of

3322
01:09:10,269 --> 01:09:10,279
where we've got a tiny tiny fraction of
 

3323
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,229
where we've got a tiny tiny fraction of
the information from history but even

3324
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:12,239
the information from history but even
 

3325
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,390
the information from history but even
that little information that we do have

3326
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:13,400
that little information that we do have
 

3327
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,950
that little information that we do have
and the archaeological record uh shows

3328
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:16,960
and the archaeological record uh shows
 

3329
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,590
and the archaeological record uh shows
so many civilizations rising and falling

3330
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:20,600
so many civilizations rising and falling
 

3331
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:22,510
so many civilizations rising and falling
for wild we tend to think that we're

3332
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:22,520
for wild we tend to think that we're
 

3333
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,709
for wild we tend to think that we're
somehow different from those people one

3334
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:24,719
somehow different from those people one
 

3335
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,630
somehow different from those people one
of the other things Durant highlights is

3336
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:26,640
of the other things Durant highlights is
 

3337
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,149
of the other things Durant highlights is
that human nature seems to be the same

3338
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:30,159
that human nature seems to be the same
 

3339
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:32,430
that human nature seems to be the same
it just persists yeah I mean the basics

3340
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:32,440
it just persists yeah I mean the basics
 

3341
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:34,229
it just persists yeah I mean the basics
of human nature are more or less the

3342
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:34,239
of human nature are more or less the
 

3343
01:09:34,239 --> 01:09:36,149
of human nature are more or less the
same yeah so we get ourselves in trouble

3344
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:36,159
same yeah so we get ourselves in trouble
 

3345
01:09:36,159 --> 01:09:38,590
same yeah so we get ourselves in trouble
in the same kinds of ways I think even

3346
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:38,600
in the same kinds of ways I think even
 

3347
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,229
in the same kinds of ways I think even
with the advanced technology yeah I mean

3348
01:09:41,229 --> 01:09:41,239
with the advanced technology yeah I mean
 

3349
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:43,030
with the advanced technology yeah I mean
you do tend to see the same patterns

3350
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:43,040
you do tend to see the same patterns
 

3351
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,630
you do tend to see the same patterns
similar patterns you know for

3352
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:44,640
similar patterns you know for
 

3353
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,829
similar patterns you know for
civilizations where they go

3354
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:46,839
civilizations where they go
 

3355
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:49,189
civilizations where they go
through a life cycle like like an

3356
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
through a life cycle like like an
 

3357
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:51,390
through a life cycle like like an
organism you know sort of just like a

3358
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:51,400
organism you know sort of just like a
 

3359
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:56,510
organism you know sort of just like a
human is sort of a zygo fetus baby you

3360
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:56,520
human is sort of a zygo fetus baby you
 

3361
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,470
human is sort of a zygo fetus baby you
know toddler

3362
01:09:59,470 --> 01:09:59,480
know toddler
 

3363
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:02,430
know toddler
teenager you know

3364
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:02,440
teenager you know
 

3365
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,790
teenager you know
eventually get gets old and dies

3366
01:10:05,790 --> 01:10:05,800
eventually get gets old and dies
 

3367
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,270
eventually get gets old and dies
the civilizations go through a life

3368
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,280
the civilizations go through a life
 

3369
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,149
the civilizations go through a life
cycle no civilization will last

3370
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:12,159
cycle no civilization will last
 

3371
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,270
cycle no civilization will last
forever what what do you think it takes

3372
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:14,280
forever what what do you think it takes
 

3373
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,990
forever what what do you think it takes
for the American Empire to not collapse

3374
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
for the American Empire to not collapse
 

3375
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,990
for the American Empire to not collapse
in the near-term future in the next 100

3376
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:20,000
in the near-term future in the next 100
 

3377
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:28,910
in the near-term future in the next 100
years to continue flourishing

3378
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:28,920

 

3379
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,510

well the single biggest thing that is

3380
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:32,520
well the single biggest thing that is
 

3381
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,830
well the single biggest thing that is
um often actually not mentioned in

3382
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:35,840
um often actually not mentioned in
 

3383
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,310
um often actually not mentioned in
history books but Durant does mention it

3384
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:38,320
history books but Durant does mention it
 

3385
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,790
history books but Durant does mention it
uh is the birri so um like a like a

3386
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:42,800
uh is the birri so um like a like a
 

3387
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,149
uh is the birri so um like a like a
perhaps to some a counterintuitive thing

3388
01:10:45,149 --> 01:10:45,159
perhaps to some a counterintuitive thing
 

3389
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:48,189
perhaps to some a counterintuitive thing
happens when civilizations

3390
01:10:48,189 --> 01:10:48,199
happens when civilizations
 

3391
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:52,470
happens when civilizations
become uh are are winning for too long

3392
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:52,480
become uh are are winning for too long
 

3393
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,790
become uh are are winning for too long
that they've been they the both rate

3394
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:55,800
that they've been they the both rate
 

3395
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,830
that they've been they the both rate
declines it can often decline quite

3396
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:57,840
declines it can often decline quite
 

3397
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:59,149
declines it can often decline quite
rapidly we're seeing that throughout the

3398
01:10:59,149 --> 01:10:59,159
rapidly we're seeing that throughout the
 

3399
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:00,830
rapidly we're seeing that throughout the
world

3400
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:00,840
world
 

3401
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,950
world
today you know currently South Korea is

3402
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:03,960
today you know currently South Korea is
 

3403
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,189
today you know currently South Korea is
like I think maybe the lowest fertility

3404
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:06,199
like I think maybe the lowest fertility
 

3405
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:08,709
like I think maybe the lowest fertility
rate but there there are many others

3406
01:11:08,709 --> 01:11:08,719
rate but there there are many others
 

3407
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:10,950
rate but there there are many others
that are close to it it's like 08 I

3408
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:10,960
that are close to it it's like 08 I
 

3409
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,510
that are close to it it's like 08 I
think if the birth rate doesn't decline

3410
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:13,520
think if the birth rate doesn't decline
 

3411
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,790
think if the birth rate doesn't decline
further South Korea will lose roughly

3412
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:16,800
further South Korea will lose roughly
 

3413
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,110
further South Korea will lose roughly
60% of its

3414
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
60% of its
 

3415
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:22,030
60% of its
population and and but every year that

3416
01:11:22,030 --> 01:11:22,040
population and and but every year that
 

3417
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,310
population and and but every year that
birth rate is

3418
01:11:23,310 --> 01:11:23,320
birth rate is
 

3419
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,950
birth rate is
dropping um and this is true through

3420
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:25,960
dropping um and this is true through
 

3421
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,430
dropping um and this is true through
most of the world I don't mean single

3422
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:27,440
most of the world I don't mean single
 

3423
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,990
most of the world I don't mean single
out South Korea it's been happening

3424
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:29,000
out South Korea it's been happening
 

3425
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,270
out South Korea it's been happening
throughout the world so as as soon as it

3426
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:33,280
throughout the world so as as soon as it
 

3427
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,790
throughout the world so as as soon as it
as soon as any given uh civilization

3428
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:35,800
as soon as any given uh civilization
 

3429
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,669
as soon as any given uh civilization
reaches a level of prosperity the birth

3430
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:37,679
reaches a level of prosperity the birth
 

3431
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:38,709
reaches a level of prosperity the birth
rate

3432
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:38,719
rate
 

3433
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,669
rate
drops um and now you can go and look at

3434
01:11:40,669 --> 01:11:40,679
drops um and now you can go and look at
 

3435
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:42,790
drops um and now you can go and look at
the same thing happening in ancient in

3436
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:42,800
the same thing happening in ancient in
 

3437
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,110
the same thing happening in ancient in
ancient Rome

3438
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:45,120
ancient Rome
 

3439
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:48,669
ancient Rome
so uh Julia Caesar took note of this I

3440
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:48,679
so uh Julia Caesar took note of this I
 

3441
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:50,990
so uh Julia Caesar took note of this I
think around 50ish

3442
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:51,000
think around 50ish
 

3443
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,510
think around 50ish
BC um and tried to pass I don't if

3444
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:54,520
BC um and tried to pass I don't if
 

3445
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,590
BC um and tried to pass I don't if
you're a successful try to pass a law to

you're a successful try to pass a law to
give an incentive for any Roman citizen

3448
01:11:58,629 --> 01:11:58,639
give an incentive for any Roman citizen
 

3449

give an incentive for any Roman citizen
that would have a third

3450
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:00,040
that would have a third
 

3451
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,550
that would have a third
child and I think

3452
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:02,560
child and I think
 

3453
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,310
child and I think

01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:11,000
just for show I think he did pass
 

3459

efforts were
 

3465
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,110
efforts were
unsuccessful

Romans that's actually the fundamental

3472
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:28,560
Romans that's actually the fundamental
 

3473
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,070
Romans that's actually the fundamental
issue and and there were other things

3474
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:30,080
issue and and there were other things
 

3475
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,390
issue and and there were other things
that there was like

3476
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
that there was like
 

3477
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,189
that there was like
um they had like quite a serious malaria

3478
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:35,199
um they had like quite a serious malaria
 

3479
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:37,669
um they had like quite a serious malaria
series of malaria epidemics and plagues

3480
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
series of malaria epidemics and plagues
 

3481
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,030
series of malaria epidemics and plagues
and whatnot um but they had those before

3482
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
and whatnot um but they had those before
 

3483
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,870
and whatnot um but they had those before
uh the the the it's just that the birth

3484
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:43,880
uh the the the it's just that the birth
 

3485
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,390
uh the the the it's just that the birth
rate was Far lower than the death

3486
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:46,400
rate was Far lower than the death
 

3487
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,790
rate was Far lower than the death
rate it really is that simple well I'm

3488
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:49,800
rate it really is that simple well I'm
 

3489
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,430
rate it really is that simple well I'm
saying that's more

3490
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:51,440
saying that's more
 

3491
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,110
saying that's more
people at a at a fundamental level if a

3492
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:54,120
people at a at a fundamental level if a
 

3493
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,709
people at a at a fundamental level if a
civilization does not at least maintain

3494
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:55,719
civilization does not at least maintain
 

3495
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:58,470
civilization does not at least maintain
its numbers um it will disappear so

3496
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,480
its numbers um it will disappear so
 

3497
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:00,270
its numbers um it will disappear so
perhaps the amount of compute that the

3498
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:00,280
perhaps the amount of compute that the
 

3499
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,390
perhaps the amount of compute that the
biological computer allocates to to sex

3500
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:03,400
biological computer allocates to to sex
 

3501
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,149
biological computer allocates to to sex
is

3502
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,159
is
 

3503
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:06,070
is
Justified in fact we should probably

3504
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
Justified in fact we should probably
 

3505
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,750
Justified in fact we should probably
increase it well I mean there's this

3506
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:08,760
increase it well I mean there's this
 

3507
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,950
increase it well I mean there's this
hetic sex which is

3508
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:10,960
hetic sex which is
 

3509
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,629
hetic sex which is
uh you know that that's neither that's

3510
01:13:13,629 --> 01:13:13,639
uh you know that that's neither that's
 

3511
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,270
uh you know that that's neither that's
neither H or there um it it's it's not

3512
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:16,280
neither H or there um it it's it's not
 

3513
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,669
neither H or there um it it's it's not
productive it's it it doesn't produce

3514
01:13:18,669 --> 01:13:18,679
productive it's it it doesn't produce
 

3515
01:13:18,679 --> 01:13:22,189
productive it's it it doesn't produce
kids well you know you what what matters

3516
01:13:22,189 --> 01:13:22,199
kids well you know you what what matters
 

3517
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:23,950
kids well you know you what what matters
I mean Durant makes this very clear cuz

3518
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:23,960
I mean Durant makes this very clear cuz
 

3519
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,709
I mean Durant makes this very clear cuz
he's looked at one civil ization after

3520
01:13:25,709 --> 01:13:25,719
he's looked at one civil ization after
 

3521
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:26,870
he's looked at one civil ization after
another and they all went through the

3522
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
another and they all went through the
 

3523
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,189
another and they all went through the
same cycle when the civilization was

3524
01:13:29,189 --> 01:13:29,199
same cycle when the civilization was
 

3525
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,470
same cycle when the civilization was
under stress the birth rate was was high

3526
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:31,480
under stress the birth rate was was high
 

3527
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,070
under stress the birth rate was was high
but as soon as there were no external

3528
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:33,080
but as soon as there were no external
 

3529
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:36,830
but as soon as there were no external
enemies or they they were had a extended

3530
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:36,840
enemies or they they were had a extended
 

3531
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,430
enemies or they they were had a extended
period of prosperity the birth rate

3532
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:38,440
period of prosperity the birth rate
 

3533
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:41,470
period of prosperity the birth rate
inevitably dropped every time I don't

3534
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:41,480
inevitably dropped every time I don't
 

3535
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:43,950
inevitably dropped every time I don't
believe there's a single

3536
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:43,960
believe there's a single
 

3537
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,229
believe there's a single
exception so that's like the foundation

3538
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
exception so that's like the foundation
 

3539
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,430
exception so that's like the foundation
of it you need to have people yeah I

3540
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:50,440
of it you need to have people yeah I
 

3541
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,149
of it you need to have people yeah I
mean it's at a base level yeah no humans

3542
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:53,159
mean it's at a base level yeah no humans
 

3543
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:55,910
mean it's at a base level yeah no humans
no humanity and then there other things

3544
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:55,920
no humanity and then there other things
 

3545
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,750
no humanity and then there other things
like you know uh human freedoms and just

3546
01:13:59,750 --> 01:13:59,760
like you know uh human freedoms and just
 

3547
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,310
like you know uh human freedoms and just
giving people the freedom to build stuff

3548
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,320
giving people the freedom to build stuff
 

3549
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,510
giving people the freedom to build stuff
yeah yeah absolutely

3550
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:04,520
yeah yeah absolutely
 

3551
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,950
yeah yeah absolutely
there but at at a basic level if you do

3552
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:06,960
there but at at a basic level if you do
 

3553
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:08,910
there but at at a basic level if you do
not at least maintain your numbers if

3554
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:08,920
not at least maintain your numbers if
 

3555
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,430
not at least maintain your numbers if
you're below replacement rate and that

3556
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:10,440
you're below replacement rate and that
 

3557
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:11,750
you're below replacement rate and that
Trend continues you will eventually

3558
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:11,760
Trend continues you will eventually
 

3559
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,470
Trend continues you will eventually
disappear it's just Elementary um now

3560
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:17,480
disappear it's just Elementary um now
 

3561
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,350
disappear it's just Elementary um now
then obviously also want to try to avoid

3562
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:20,360
then obviously also want to try to avoid
 

3563
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:25,189
then obviously also want to try to avoid
like uh massive Wars um

3564
01:14:25,189 --> 01:14:25,199
like uh massive Wars um
 

3565
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,270
like uh massive Wars um
you know if there's a global

3566
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:26,280
you know if there's a global
 

3567
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:30,510
you know if there's a global
thermonuclear war prob Royal toast you

3568
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:30,520
thermonuclear war prob Royal toast you
 

3569
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,470
thermonuclear war prob Royal toast you
know radioactive

3570
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:35,480

 

3571
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,870

toast so we want to try to avoid those

3572
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:37,880
toast so we want to try to avoid those
 

3573
01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,709
toast so we want to try to avoid those
things um then there there are um

3574
01:14:41,709 --> 01:14:41,719
things um then there there are um
 

3575
01:14:41,719 --> 01:14:43,310
things um then there there are um
there's a thing that happens over time

3576
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:43,320
there's a thing that happens over time
 

3577
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:45,110
there's a thing that happens over time
with with any

3578
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
with with any
 

3579
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,709
with with any
given uh civilization which is that

3580
01:14:48,709 --> 01:14:48,719
given uh civilization which is that
 

3581
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,590
given uh civilization which is that
the laws and regulations

3582
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:51,600
the laws and regulations
 

3583
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,350
the laws and regulations
accumulate um and if there's not if

3584
01:14:54,350 --> 01:14:54,360
accumulate um and if there's not if
 

3585
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:56,030
accumulate um and if there's not if
there's not some forcing function like a

3586
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:56,040
there's not some forcing function like a
 

3587
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,990
there's not some forcing function like a
war to clean up the accumulation of laws

3588
01:14:58,990 --> 01:14:59,000
war to clean up the accumulation of laws
 

3589
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,669
war to clean up the accumulation of laws
and regulations eventually everything

3590
01:15:00,669 --> 01:15:00,679
and regulations eventually everything
 

3591
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:03,110
and regulations eventually everything
becomes legal and

01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:27,239
allocate your time to be the most
 

3749
01:18:27,239 --> 01:18:30,590
allocate your time to be the most
useful well time time is the try time is

3750
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:30,600
useful well time time is the try time is
 

3751
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,669
useful well time time is the try time is
the true currency yeah so it is tough to

3752
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:34,679
the true currency yeah so it is tough to
 

3753
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:36,350
the true currency yeah so it is tough to
say what what is the best allocation

3754
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:36,360
say what what is the best allocation
 

3755
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,550
say what what is the best allocation
time I mean there

3756
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:39,560
time I mean there
 

3757
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,310
time I mean there
are you know often say if you if you

3758
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
are you know often say if you if you
 

3759
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,350
are you know often say if you if you
look at say Tesla I mean Tesla this year

3760
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:45,360
look at say Tesla I mean Tesla this year
 

3761
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,750
look at say Tesla I mean Tesla this year
will do over 100 billion in Revenue so

3762
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,760
will do over 100 billion in Revenue so
 

3763
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,110
will do over 100 billion in Revenue so
that's $2 billion a week

3764
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:50,120
that's $2 billion a week
 

3765
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,189
that's $2 billion a week
um if I make slightly better decisions I

3766
01:18:53,189 --> 01:18:53,199
um if I make slightly better decisions I
 

3767
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:57,430
um if I make slightly better decisions I
can affect the outcome by a billion

3768
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:57,440
can affect the outcome by a billion
 

3769
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,709
can affect the outcome by a billion
dollars

3770
01:18:59,709 --> 01:18:59,719
dollars
 

3771
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:01,950
dollars
so then

3772
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:01,960
so then
 

3773
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,990
so then
uh you know I try to do the best

3774
01:19:03,990 --> 01:19:04,000
uh you know I try to do the best
 

3775
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,110
uh you know I try to do the best
decisions I can and on balance you know

3776
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:06,120
decisions I can and on balance you know
 

3777
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,590
decisions I can and on balance you know
at least compared to the the competition

3778
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:08,600
at least compared to the the competition
 

3779
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,750
at least compared to the the competition
pretty good decisions but the marginal

3780
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:10,760
pretty good decisions but the marginal
 

3781
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,350
pretty good decisions but the marginal
value of of a better decision can easily

3782
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:15,360
value of of a better decision can easily
 

3783
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,870
value of of a better decision can easily
be in the course of an hour $100 million

3784
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:17,880
be in the course of an hour $100 million
 

3785
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,270
be in the course of an hour $100 million
do given that how do you take risks how

3786
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:21,280
do given that how do you take risks how
 

3787
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,149

do you do the the algorithm that you

3788
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:23,159
do you do the the algorithm that you
 

3789
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:25,229
do you do the the algorithm that you
mentioned I mean deleting

3790
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:25,239
mentioned I mean deleting
 

3791
01:19:25,239 --> 01:19:27,149

given that a small thing can be a

3792
01:19:27,149 --> 01:19:27,159
given that a small thing can be a
 

3793
01:19:27,159 --> 01:19:31,189
given that a small thing can be a
billion dollars how do you decide to

3794
01:19:31,189 --> 01:19:31,199
billion dollars how do you decide to
 

3795
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,510
billion dollars how do you decide to
yeah well I think you have to look at it

3796
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:33,520
yeah well I think you have to look at it
 

3797
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:34,910
yeah well I think you have to look at it
on a percentage basis because if you

3798
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:34,920
on a percentage basis because if you
 

3799
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,149
on a percentage basis because if you
look at it in absolute terms it's it's

3800
01:19:37,149 --> 01:19:37,159
look at it in absolute terms it's it's
 

3801
01:19:37,159 --> 01:19:39,149
look at it in absolute terms it's it's
just uh I would never get any sleep it's

3802
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:39,159
just uh I would never get any sleep it's
 

3803
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:40,550
just uh I would never get any sleep it's
it would just be like I need to just

01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:40,560
it would just be like I need to just
 

3805
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:44,070
it would just be like I need to just
keep working and and work my brain

3806
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:44,080
keep working and and work my brain
 

3807
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:46,149

harder you know and I'm not trying to

3808
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:46,159
harder you know and I'm not trying to
 

3809
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:47,709

filters like just like why why have we
not heard from the aliens now L lot of

3904
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:52,600
not heard from the aliens now L lot of
 

3905
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:55,030
not heard from the aliens now L lot of
people think there are aliens Among Us I

3906
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:55,040
people think there are aliens Among Us I
 

3907
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,950
people think there are aliens Among Us I
often claim to be one nobody believes me

3908
01:21:58,950 --> 01:21:58,960
often claim to be one nobody believes me
 

3909
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:01,950
often claim to be one nobody believes me
but um it did say alien registration

3910
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:01,960
but um it did say alien registration
 

3911
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,910
but um it did say alien registration
card at one point on my

3912
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:03,920
card at one point on my
 

3913
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,070
card at one point on my
uh immigration documents um yeah so I've

3914
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
uh immigration documents um yeah so I've
 

3915
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,430
uh immigration documents um yeah so I've
not seen any evidence of aliens so it's

3916
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:10,440
not seen any evidence of aliens so it's
 

3917
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,669
not seen any evidence of aliens so it's
suggest that um at least one of the one

3918
01:22:12,669 --> 01:22:12,679
suggest that um at least one of the one
 

3919
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:15,110
suggest that um at least one of the one
of the explanations is that uh

3920
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:15,120
of the explanations is that uh
 

3921
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,310
of the explanations is that uh
intelligent life is extremely

3922
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:17,320
intelligent life is extremely
 

3923
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:20,070
intelligent life is extremely
rare um and again if you look at the

3924
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:20,080
rare um and again if you look at the
 

3925
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:22,590
rare um and again if you look at the
history of Earth civilization's only

3926
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:22,600
history of Earth civilization's only
 

3927
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,750
history of Earth civilization's only
been around

3928
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:24,760
been around
 

3929
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,629
been around
for one millionth of Earth

3930
01:22:26,629 --> 01:22:26,639
for one millionth of Earth
 

3931
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:29,550
for one millionth of Earth
existence so if you know if aliens had

3932
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:29,560
existence so if you know if aliens had
 

3933
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,229
existence so if you know if aliens had
visited here say 100,000 years ago they

3934
01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:33,239
visited here say 100,000 years ago they
 

3935
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,870
visited here say 100,000 years ago they
would be like well they don't even have

3936
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880
would be like well they don't even have
 

3937
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,629
would be like well they don't even have
writing you know just hunter gatherers

3938
01:22:37,629 --> 01:22:37,639
writing you know just hunter gatherers
 

3939
01:22:37,639 --> 01:22:39,110
writing you know just hunter gatherers
basically

3940
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:39,120
basically
 

3941
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,870
basically
so

3942
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:41,880
so
 

3943
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,350
so
um so how long does a civilization

3944
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:45,360
um so how long does a civilization
 

3945
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:49,750
um so how long does a civilization
last so for SpaceX the goal is to

3946
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:49,760
last so for SpaceX the goal is to
 

3947
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,189
last so for SpaceX the goal is to
establish a self-sustaining City on Mars

3948
01:22:53,189 --> 01:22:53,199
establish a self-sustaining City on Mars
 

3949
01:22:53,199 --> 01:22:55,110
establish a self-sustaining City on Mars
Mars is the only

3950
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:55,120
Mars is the only
 

3951
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:58,709
Mars is the only
viable planet for such a thing um the

3952
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:58,719
viable planet for such a thing um the
 

3953
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,709
viable planet for such a thing um the
Moon is close but it's it lacks

3954
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:00,719
Moon is close but it's it lacks
 

3955
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,910
Moon is close but it's it lacks
resources and I think it's

3956
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:03,920
resources and I think it's
 

3957
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,550
resources and I think it's
probably vulnerable to any any any

3958
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:07,560
probably vulnerable to any any any
 

3959
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,870
probably vulnerable to any any any
Calamity that takes out Earth could the

3960
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:09,880
Calamity that takes out Earth could the
 

3961
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,070
Calamity that takes out Earth could the
Moon is too close it's vulnerable to a

3962
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:13,080
Moon is too close it's vulnerable to a
 

3963
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:17,750
Moon is too close it's vulnerable to a
Calamity that takes out Earth um so not

3964
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:17,760
Calamity that takes out Earth um so not
 

3965
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,950
Calamity that takes out Earth um so not
saying we shouldn't have a moon base but

3966
01:23:19,950 --> 01:23:19,960
saying we shouldn't have a moon base but
 

3967
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,110
saying we shouldn't have a moon base but
Ms is Ms would be far more resilient um

3968
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:23,120
Ms is Ms would be far more resilient um
 

3969
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,189
Ms is Ms would be far more resilient um
the difficulty of getting to Ms is what

3970
01:23:25,189 --> 01:23:25,199
the difficulty of getting to Ms is what
 

3971
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,669
the difficulty of getting to Ms is what
makes it

3972
01:23:26,669 --> 01:23:26,679
makes it
 

3973
01:23:26,679 --> 01:23:29,350
makes it
resilient

3974
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:29,360
resilient
 

3975
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,990
resilient
um so but and you know in going through

3976
01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:33,000
um so but and you know in going through
 

3977
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,910
um so but and you know in going through
the these various explanations of why

3978
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:34,920
the these various explanations of why
 

3979
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,110
the these various explanations of why
don't we see the aliens why one of them

3980
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:38,120
don't we see the aliens why one of them
 

3981
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:41,990
don't we see the aliens why one of them
is that they they failed to pass

3982
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,000
is that they they failed to pass
 

3983
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,990
is that they they failed to pass
these these great filters these

3984
01:23:45,990 --> 01:23:46,000
these these great filters these
 

3985
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,870
these these great filters these
these key

3986
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:47,880
these key
 

3987
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:51,310
these key
hurdles and one of those hles is being a

3988
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:51,320
hurdles and one of those hles is being a
 

3989
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,790
hurdles and one of those hles is being a
multiplet

3990
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:52,800
multiplet
 

3991
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,910
multiplet
species um so if you're multiplet

3992
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:54,920
species um so if you're multiplet
 

3993
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:57,310
species um so if you're multiplet
species and if something would happen

3994
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:57,320
species and if something would happen
 

3995
01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:00,510
species and if something would happen
whether that was a natural catastrophe

3996
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:00,520
whether that was a natural catastrophe
 

3997
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,709
whether that was a natural catastrophe
or a man-made catastrophy at least the

3998
01:24:03,709 --> 01:24:03,719
or a man-made catastrophy at least the
 

3999
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:05,590
or a man-made catastrophy at least the
other planet would probably still be

4000
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:05,600
other planet would probably still be
 

4001
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,189
other planet would probably still be
around so you're not like you don't have

4002
01:24:08,189 --> 01:24:08,199
around so you're not like you don't have
 

4003
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:09,470
around so you're not like you don't have
all the eggs in one

4004
01:24:09,470 --> 01:24:09,480
all the eggs in one
 

4005
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:12,270
all the eggs in one
basket and once you are sort of a two

4006
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:12,280
basket and once you are sort of a two
 

4007
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,629
basket and once you are sort of a two
Planet species you can obviously extend

4008
01:24:14,629 --> 01:24:14,639
Planet species you can obviously extend
 

4009
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,189
Planet species you can obviously extend
to extend life paths to the asteroid

4010
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:17,199
to extend life paths to the asteroid
 

4011
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:19,669
to extend life paths to the asteroid
belt to maybe to the moons of Jupiter

4012
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
belt to maybe to the moons of Jupiter
 

4013
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:20,709
belt to maybe to the moons of Jupiter
and

4014
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:20,719
and
 

4015
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,629
and
Saturn um and ultimately to other star

4016
01:24:23,629 --> 01:24:23,639
Saturn um and ultimately to other star
 

4017
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:25,910
Saturn um and ultimately to other star
systems but if you can't even get to

4018
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:25,920
systems but if you can't even get to
 

4019
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,790
systems but if you can't even get to
another planet you definitely not

4020
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
another planet you definitely not
 

4021
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,550
another planet you definitely not
getting to Star systems and the other

4022
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:30,560
getting to Star systems and the other
 

4023
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:33,669
getting to Star systems and the other
possible great field there uh super

4024
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679
possible great field there uh super
 

4025
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,709
possible great field there uh super
powerful technology like AGI for example

4026
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:36,719
powerful technology like AGI for example
 

4027
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,669
powerful technology like AGI for example
So you you're basically trying to knock

4028
01:24:39,669 --> 01:24:39,679
So you you're basically trying to knock
 

4029
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,669
So you you're basically trying to knock
out one great filter at a

4030
01:24:43,669 --> 01:24:43,679
out one great filter at a
 

4031
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:46,709
out one great filter at a
time digital superintelligence is

4032
01:24:46,709 --> 01:24:46,719
time digital superintelligence is
 

4033
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:49,669
time digital superintelligence is
possibly a great filter I hope it isn't

4034
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:49,679
possibly a great filter I hope it isn't
 

4035
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:52,709
possibly a great filter I hope it isn't
but it might be you know guys like say

4036
01:24:52,709 --> 01:24:52,719
but it might be you know guys like say
 

4037
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:55,229
but it might be you know guys like say
Jeff Hinton would say

4038
01:24:55,229 --> 01:24:55,239
Jeff Hinton would say
 

4039
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:57,229
Jeff Hinton would say
you know has he invented a number of the

4040
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:57,239
you know has he invented a number of the
 

4041
01:24:57,239 --> 01:24:59,470
you know has he invented a number of the
key principles in artificial

4042
01:24:59,470 --> 01:24:59,480
key principles in artificial
 

4043
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,510
key principles in artificial
intelligence I think he puts the

4044
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,520
intelligence I think he puts the
 

4045
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,590
intelligence I think he puts the
probability of AI Anni Annihilation

4046
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:03,600
probability of AI Anni Annihilation
 

4047
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,669
probability of AI Anni Annihilation
around 10 to 20% something like

4048
01:25:06,669 --> 01:25:06,679
around 10 to 20% something like
 

4049
01:25:06,679 --> 01:25:09,270
around 10 to 20% something like
that

4050
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:09,280
that
 

4051
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,310
that
so you know so it's it's not uh like you

4052
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:13,320
so you know so it's it's not uh like you
 

4053
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,030
so you know so it's it's not uh like you
know look on the right side it's a 80%

4054
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:15,040
know look on the right side it's a 80%
 

4055
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:17,070
know look on the right side it's a 80%
likely to be

4056
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:17,080
likely to be
 

4057
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,870
likely to be
great so so but I I think AI risk

4058
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:20,880
great so so but I I think AI risk
 

4059
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,350
great so so but I I think AI risk
mitigation is important um being a multi

4060
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:24,360
mitigation is important um being a multi
 

4061
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,629
mitigation is important um being a multi
species would be a massive risk

4062
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
species would be a massive risk
 

4063
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,470
species would be a massive risk
mitigation and um I I do want to sort of

4064
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:30,480
mitigation and um I I do want to sort of
 

4065
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:31,830
mitigation and um I I do want to sort of
once again emphasize this import the

4066
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:31,840
once again emphasize this import the
 

4067
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,510
once again emphasize this import the
importance of having enough children to

4068
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:34,520
importance of having enough children to
 

4069
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,430
importance of having enough children to
sustain um

4070
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:36,440
sustain um
 

4071
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:41,910
sustain um
our numbers um and not going not plummet

4072
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:41,920
our numbers um and not going not plummet
 

4073
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,310
our numbers um and not going not plummet
into population collapse which is

4074
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:44,320
into population collapse which is
 

4075
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,550
into population collapse which is
currently happening po population

4076
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,560
currently happening po population
 

4077
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,990
currently happening po population
collapse is a real and current thing

4078
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:50,000
collapse is a real and current thing
 

4079
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,430
collapse is a real and current thing
um so the the only reason it's not being

4080
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:54,440
um so the the only reason it's not being
 

4081
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,470
um so the the only reason it's not being
reflected in the total population

4082
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:56,480
reflected in the total population
 

4083
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,510
reflected in the total population
numbers is that is that as much is

4084
01:25:58,510 --> 01:25:58,520
numbers is that is that as much is
 

4085
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:00,270
numbers is that is that as much is
because people are living

4086
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:00,280
because people are living
 

4087
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,229
because people are living
longer um but but you you you can it's

4088
01:26:03,229 --> 01:26:03,239
longer um but but you you you can it's
 

4089
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:05,149
longer um but but you you you can it's
easy to predict say what the population

4090
01:26:05,149 --> 01:26:05,159
easy to predict say what the population
 

4091
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:08,229
easy to predict say what the population
of Any Given country will be um you just

4092
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:08,239
of Any Given country will be um you just
 

4093
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:10,629
of Any Given country will be um you just
take the birth rate last year how many

4094
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
take the birth rate last year how many
 

4095
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,510
take the birth rate last year how many
VES were born multiply that by life

4096
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:12,520
VES were born multiply that by life
 

4097
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,950
VES were born multiply that by life
expectancy and that's what the

4098
01:26:13,950 --> 01:26:13,960
expectancy and that's what the
 

4099
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:15,790
expectancy and that's what the
population will be a steady state

4100
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:15,800
population will be a steady state
 

4101
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,990
population will be a steady state
unless if if the birth rate continues to

4102
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,000
unless if if the birth rate continues to
 

4103
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,030
unless if if the birth rate continues to
that level but if it keeps declining it

4104
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:20,040
that level but if it keeps declining it
 

4105
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,629
that level but if it keeps declining it
will be even less and eventually dwindle

4106
01:26:22,629 --> 01:26:22,639
will be even less and eventually dwindle
 

4107
01:26:22,639 --> 01:26:24,950
will be even less and eventually dwindle
to nothing so I keep you know banging on

4108
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:24,960
to nothing so I keep you know banging on
 

4109
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,510
to nothing so I keep you know banging on
the baby drum here um for a reason um

4110
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:28,520
the baby drum here um for a reason um
 

4111
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:30,430
the baby drum here um for a reason um
because it has been the the source of

4112
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:30,440
because it has been the the source of
 

4113
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,910
because it has been the the source of
civilizational collapse over and over

4114
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:31,920
civilizational collapse over and over
 

4115
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,390
civilizational collapse over and over
again throughout history um and

4116
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:36,400
again throughout history um and
 

4117
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,270
again throughout history um and
so why don't we just uh not try to

4118
01:26:40,270 --> 01:26:40,280
so why don't we just uh not try to
 

4119
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,350
so why don't we just uh not try to
stable for that day well in that way I

4120
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:42,360
stable for that day well in that way I
 

4121
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,669
stable for that day well in that way I
have miserably failed civilization and

4122
01:26:45,669 --> 01:26:45,679
have miserably failed civilization and
 

4123
01:26:45,679 --> 01:26:48,669
have miserably failed civilization and
I'm trying hoping to fix that I would

4124
01:26:48,669 --> 01:26:48,679
I'm trying hoping to fix that I would
 

4125
01:26:48,679 --> 01:26:50,550
I'm trying hoping to fix that I would
love to have many kids uh great I hope

4126
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:50,560
love to have many kids uh great I hope
 

4127
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:51,270
love to have many kids uh great I hope
you

4128
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:51,280
you
 

4129
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:56,030
you
do um no time like the present

4130
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:56,040
do um no time like the present
 

4131
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:58,149
do um no time like the present
yeah yeah I got to allocate more compute

4132
01:26:58,149 --> 01:26:58,159
yeah yeah I got to allocate more compute
 

4133
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:00,669
yeah yeah I got to allocate more compute
to the whole process um but apparently

4134
01:27:00,669 --> 01:27:00,679
to the whole process um but apparently
 

4135
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:03,390
to the whole process um but apparently
it's not that difficult no it's like

4136
01:27:03,390 --> 01:27:03,400
it's not that difficult no it's like
 

4137
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,350
it's not that difficult no it's like

4138
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,360
unskill
 

4139
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,229
unskill
Labor uh well if I one of the things uh

4140
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:10,239
Labor uh well if I one of the things uh
 

4141
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:12,070
Labor uh well if I one of the things uh
you do for me for the world is to

4142
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,080
you do for me for the world is to
 

4143
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,030
you do for me for the world is to
inspire us with what the future could be

4144
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:14,040
inspire us with what the future could be
 

4145
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:15,790
inspire us with what the future could be
and so some of the things we've talked

4146
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:15,800
and so some of the things we've talked
 

4147
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,990
and so some of the things we've talked
about some of the things you're building

4148
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,000
about some of the things you're building
 

4149
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,790
about some of the things you're building
um alleviating human suffering with

4150
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:20,800
um alleviating human suffering with
 

4151
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,629
um alleviating human suffering with
neuralink and expanding the capabilities

4152
01:27:22,629 --> 01:27:22,639
neuralink and expanding the capabilities
 

4153
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:25,189
neuralink and expanding the capabilities
of the human mind trying to build the

4154
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:25,199
of the human mind trying to build the
 

4155
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,790
of the human mind trying to build the
colony on

4156

colony on
 

4157
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,870

exploring the possibilities of what
 

4163
01:27:36,199 --> 01:27:38,070
exploring the possibilities of what
artificial intelligence could be in this

4164
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:38,080
artificial intelligence could be in this
 

4165
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:40,990
artificial intelligence could be in this
world especially in the real world AI

4166

fascinated by the human brain for me I

4200
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:23,920
fascinated by the human brain for me I
 

4201
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:26,109
fascinated by the human brain for me I
was was always interested in

4202
01:28:26,109 --> 01:28:26,119
was was always interested in
 

4203
01:28:26,119 --> 01:28:29,470
was was always interested in
understanding the purpose of things

4204
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:29,480
understanding the purpose of things
 

4205
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,270
understanding the purpose of things
and how it was engineered to serve that

4206
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:32,280
and how it was engineered to serve that
 

4207
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:34,270
and how it was engineered to serve that
purpose whether it's

4208
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:34,280
purpose whether it's
 

4209
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,830
purpose whether it's
organic or inorganic you know like we

4210
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:36,840
organic or inorganic you know like we
 

4211
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:39,870
organic or inorganic you know like we
were talking earlier about your curtain

4212
01:28:39,870 --> 01:28:39,880
were talking earlier about your curtain
 

4213
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,229
were talking earlier about your curtain
holders they serve a clear purpose and

4214
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:42,239
holders they serve a clear purpose and
 

4215
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:44,070
holders they serve a clear purpose and
they were engineered with that purpose

4216
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:44,080
they were engineered with that purpose
 

4217
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:45,270
they were engineered with that purpose
in

4218
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:45,280
in
 

4219
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:48,510
in
mind and you know growing up I had a lot

4220
01:28:48,510 --> 01:28:48,520
mind and you know growing up I had a lot
 

4221
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:49,910
mind and you know growing up I had a lot
of interest

4222
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:49,920
of interest
 

4223
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,350
of interest
in seeing things touching things feeling

4224
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:53,360
in seeing things touching things feeling
 

4225
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,390
in seeing things touching things feeling
things and trying to really understand

4226
01:28:55,390 --> 01:28:55,400
things and trying to really understand
 

4227
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,910
things and trying to really understand
the root of how it was designed to serve

4228
01:28:58,910 --> 01:28:58,920
the root of how it was designed to serve
 

4229
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,990
the root of how it was designed to serve
that purpose and you know obviously

4230
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:01,000
that purpose and you know obviously
 

4231
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,830
that purpose and you know obviously
brain is just a fascinating organ that

4232
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:02,840
brain is just a fascinating organ that
 

4233
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:06,310
brain is just a fascinating organ that
we all carry it's a infinitely powerful

4234
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:06,320
we all carry it's a infinitely powerful
 

4235
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:09,430
we all carry it's a infinitely powerful
machine that has Intelligence and

4236
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:09,440
machine that has Intelligence and
 

4237
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:10,990
machine that has Intelligence and
cognition that arise from it and you

4238
01:29:10,990 --> 01:29:11,000
cognition that arise from it and you
 

4239
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,070
cognition that arise from it and you
know we we haven't even scratched the

4240
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:13,080
know we we haven't even scratched the
 

4241
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:16,070
know we we haven't even scratched the
surface in terms of how all of that

4242
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:16,080
surface in terms of how all of that
 

4243
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:18,629
surface in terms of how all of that
occurs but also at the same time I think

4244
01:29:18,629 --> 01:29:18,639
occurs but also at the same time I think
 

4245
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:20,430
occurs but also at the same time I think
it took me a while to make that

4246
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:20,440
it took me a while to make that
 

4247
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,510
it took me a while to make that
connection to really studying and

4248
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:22,520
connection to really studying and
 

4249
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,709
connection to really studying and
building Tech to understand the brain

4250
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:24,719
building Tech to understand the brain
 

4251
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,790
building Tech to understand the brain
not until graduate school you know there

4252
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:26,800
not until graduate school you know there
 

4253
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,590
not until graduate school you know there
were a couple moments key moments in my

4254
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:29,600
were a couple moments key moments in my
 

4255
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,430
were a couple moments key moments in my
life where some of those I think

4256
01:29:32,430 --> 01:29:32,440
life where some of those I think
 

4257
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,830
life where some of those I think
influence how the trajectory of My Life

4258
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:35,840
influence how the trajectory of My Life
 

4259
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,109
influence how the trajectory of My Life
um got me to studying uh what I'm doing

4260
01:29:39,109 --> 01:29:39,119
um got me to studying uh what I'm doing
 

4261
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:41,870
um got me to studying uh what I'm doing
right now you know one was growing up

4262
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:41,880
right now you know one was growing up
 

4263
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,830
right now you know one was growing up
both sides of my family uh my

4264
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:43,840
both sides of my family uh my
 

4265
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:47,270
both sides of my family uh my
grandparents had a very severe form of

4266
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:47,280
grandparents had a very severe form of
 

4267
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,470
grandparents had a very severe form of
Alzheimer and it's um you know

4268
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:50,480
Alzheimer and it's um you know
 

4269
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:51,709
Alzheimer and it's um you know
incredibly

4270
01:29:51,709 --> 01:29:51,719
incredibly
 

4271
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,990
incredibly
debilitating conditions um I mean

4272
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:54,000
debilitating conditions um I mean
 

4273
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,149
debilitating conditions um I mean
literally you're seeing someone's whole

4274
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
literally you're seeing someone's whole
 

4275
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,669
literally you're seeing someone's whole
identity and and their mind just losing

4276
01:29:58,669 --> 01:29:58,679
identity and and their mind just losing
 

4277
01:29:58,679 --> 01:30:01,830
identity and and their mind just losing
over time and I I just remember thinking

4278
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:01,840
over time and I I just remember thinking
 

4279
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,109
over time and I I just remember thinking
um how both the power of the mind but

4280
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:05,119
um how both the power of the mind but
 

4281
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:06,990
um how both the power of the mind but
also how something like that could

4282
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:07,000
also how something like that could
 

4283
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,990
also how something like that could
really lose your sense of identity it's

4284
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,000
really lose your sense of identity it's
 

4285
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,070
really lose your sense of identity it's
fascinating that that is one of the ways

4286
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:12,080
fascinating that that is one of the ways
 

4287
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,830
fascinating that that is one of the ways
to reveal the power of a thing by

4288
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:13,840
to reveal the power of a thing by
 

4289
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,310
to reveal the power of a thing by
watching

4290
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:15,320
watching
 

4291
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:18,550
watching
it lose the power yeah a lot of what we

4292
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:18,560
it lose the power yeah a lot of what we
 

4293
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:21,229
it lose the power yeah a lot of what we
know about the brain actually comes from

4294
01:30:21,229 --> 01:30:21,239
know about the brain actually comes from
 

4295
01:30:21,239 --> 01:30:24,590
know about the brain actually comes from
uh these cases where uh there are trauma

4296
01:30:24,590 --> 01:30:24,600
uh these cases where uh there are trauma
 

4297
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,229
uh these cases where uh there are trauma
to the brain or some parts of the brain

4298
01:30:26,229 --> 01:30:26,239
to the brain or some parts of the brain
 

4299
01:30:26,239 --> 01:30:28,590
to the brain or some parts of the brain
that led someone to lose certain

4300
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:28,600
that led someone to lose certain
 

4301
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,550
that led someone to lose certain
abilities and as a result there's

4302
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:31,560
abilities and as a result there's
 

4303
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:34,030
abilities and as a result there's
some correlation and understanding of

4304
01:30:34,030 --> 01:30:34,040
some correlation and understanding of
 

4305
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,430
some correlation and understanding of
that part of the tissue being critical

4306
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:35,440
that part of the tissue being critical
 

4307
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,189
that part of the tissue being critical
for that function and um it's an

4308
01:30:38,189 --> 01:30:38,199
for that function and um it's an
 

4309
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:41,229
for that function and um it's an
incredibly fragile organ if you think

4310
01:30:41,229 --> 01:30:41,239
incredibly fragile organ if you think
 

4311
01:30:41,239 --> 01:30:42,990
incredibly fragile organ if you think
about it that way but also it's

4312
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:43,000
about it that way but also it's

01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,870
about it that way but also it's

my life has been during my teenager when
 

4333
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:09,310
my life has been during my teenager when
I came to the

4334
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:09,320
I came to the
 

4335
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,390
I came to the
US you know I didn't speak a word of

4336
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:11,400
US you know I didn't speak a word of
 

4337
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:13,270
US you know I didn't speak a word of
English there was a huge language

4338
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:13,280
English there was a huge language
 

4339
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,430
English there was a huge language
barrier and um there was a lot of

4340
01:31:16,430 --> 01:31:16,440
barrier and um there was a lot of
 

4341
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,070
barrier and um there was a lot of
struggle to kind of connect with my

4342
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:18,080
struggle to kind of connect with my
 

4343
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,870
struggle to kind of connect with my
peers around me um because I didn't

4344
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:20,880
peers around me um because I didn't
 

4345
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,390
peers around me um because I didn't
understand the the artificial construct

4346
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:23,400
understand the the artificial construct
 

4347
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,149
understand the the artificial construct
that we have cre created called language

4348
01:31:25,149 --> 01:31:25,159
that we have cre created called language
 

4349
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:27,189
that we have cre created called language
uh specifically English in this case and

4350
01:31:27,189 --> 01:31:27,199
uh specifically English in this case and
 

4351
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:29,910
uh specifically English in this case and
I remember feeling pretty isolated not

4352
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:29,920
I remember feeling pretty isolated not
 

4353
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,629
I remember feeling pretty isolated not
being able to connect with peers around

4354
01:31:31,629 --> 01:31:31,639
being able to connect with peers around
 

4355
01:31:31,639 --> 01:31:34,709
being able to connect with peers around
me so spent a lot of time just on my own

4356
01:31:34,709 --> 01:31:34,719
me so spent a lot of time just on my own
 

4357
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:37,310
me so spent a lot of time just on my own
you know reading books watching movies

4358
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:37,320
you know reading books watching movies
 

4359
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,590
you know reading books watching movies
um and I I naturally sort of gravitated

4360
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:39,600
um and I I naturally sort of gravitated
 

4361
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,109
um and I I naturally sort of gravitated
towards sci-fi books I just found them

4362
01:31:42,109 --> 01:31:42,119
towards sci-fi books I just found them
 

4363
01:31:42,119 --> 01:31:43,790
towards sci-fi books I just found them
really really interesting and also it

4364
01:31:43,790 --> 01:31:43,800
really really interesting and also it
 

4365
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:46,229
really really interesting and also it
was a great way for me to learn English

4366
01:31:46,229 --> 01:31:46,239
was a great way for me to learn English
 

4367
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:47,870
was a great way for me to learn English
you know some of the first set of books

led me to pursue whatever project that I

4490
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:16,880
led me to pursue whatever project that I
 

4491
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:18,430
led me to pursue whatever project that I
want and that's that's one of the things

4492
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:18,440
want and that's that's one of the things
 

4493
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:20,350
want and that's that's one of the things
that uh I really enjoyed about my

4494
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:20,360
that uh I really enjoyed about my
 

4495
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,950
that uh I really enjoyed about my
graduate school career where you got to

4496
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:22,960
graduate school career where you got to
 

4497
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,550
graduate school career where you got to
kind of pursue do your intellectual

4498

kind of pursue do your intellectual
curiosity in the domain that may not

4500
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:26,880
curiosity in the domain that may not
 

4501
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:28,390
curiosity in the domain that may not
matter at the end of the day but is

4502
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:28,400
matter at the end of the day but is
 

4503
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,149
matter at the end of the day but is
something that you know really uh allows

4504
01:34:31,149 --> 01:34:31,159
something that you know really uh allows
 

4505
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:33,990
something that you know really uh allows
you the opportunity to um go as deeply

4506
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,000
you the opportunity to um go as deeply
 

4507
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,870
you the opportunity to um go as deeply
as you want as well as as widely as you

4508
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:35,880
as you want as well as as widely as you
 

4509
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,990
as you want as well as as widely as you
want and at the time I was actually

4510
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,000
want and at the time I was actually
 

4511
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,430
want and at the time I was actually
working on this project called the smart

4512
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:39,440
working on this project called the smart
 

4513
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,590
working on this project called the smart
bandid and the idea was that when you

4514
01:34:42,590 --> 01:34:42,600
bandid and the idea was that when you
 

4515
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,950
bandid and the idea was that when you
get a wound there's a lot of other kind

4516
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:44,960
get a wound there's a lot of other kind
 

4517
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,109
get a wound there's a lot of other kind
of proliferation of signaling pathway

4518
01:34:48,109 --> 01:34:48,119
of proliferation of signaling pathway
 

4519
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:51,070
of proliferation of signaling pathway
that cells follow to close that wound

4520
01:34:51,070 --> 01:34:51,080
that cells follow to close that wound
 

4521
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:54,350
that cells follow to close that wound
and there were hypothesis that

4522
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:54,360
and there were hypothesis that
 

4523
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,629
and there were hypothesis that
when you apply external electric field

4524
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
when you apply external electric field
 

4525
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,709
when you apply external electric field
you can actually accelerate the closing

4526
01:34:58,709 --> 01:34:58,719
you can actually accelerate the closing
 

4527
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:01,310
you can actually accelerate the closing
of that field by having you know

4528
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:01,320
of that field by having you know
 

4529
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,990
of that field by having you know
basically electr taxing of the cells

4530
01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:04,000
basically electr taxing of the cells
 

4531
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,310
basically electr taxing of the cells
around that wound site and specifically

4532
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:07,320
around that wound site and specifically
 

4533
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,830
around that wound site and specifically
not just for normal wound there are

4534
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:08,840
not just for normal wound there are
 

4535
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,990
not just for normal wound there are
chronic wounds that don't heal um so we

4536
01:35:10,990 --> 01:35:11,000
chronic wounds that don't heal um so we
 

4537
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:12,709
chronic wounds that don't heal um so we
were interested in building you know

4538
01:35:12,709 --> 01:35:12,719
were interested in building you know
 

4539
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:14,590
were interested in building you know
some sort of a wearable patch that you

4540
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:14,600
some sort of a wearable patch that you
 

4541
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,590
some sort of a wearable patch that you
could

4542
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:15,600
could
 

4543
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,750
could
um apply to kind of facilitate that

4544
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:18,760
um apply to kind of facilitate that
 

4545
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:22,149
um apply to kind of facilitate that
healing process and um that was in

4546
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:22,159
healing process and um that was in
 

4547
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,350
healing process and um that was in
collaboration with uh Professor Michelle

4548
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:24,360
collaboration with uh Professor Michelle
 

4549

thesis committee and you know really
shaped rest of my uh PhD career so this

4556
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:33,760
shaped rest of my uh PhD career so this
 

4557
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:35,109
shaped rest of my uh PhD career so this
would be the first time you interacted

4558
01:35:35,109 --> 01:35:35,119
would be the first time you interacted

Grail when it comes to implant system is

4596
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:24,560
Grail when it comes to implant system is
 

4597
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:27,310
Grail when it comes to implant system is
to kind of understand how small of a

4598
01:36:27,310 --> 01:36:27,320
to kind of understand how small of a
 

4599
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,830
to kind of understand how small of a
thing you can make and a lot of that is

4600
01:36:29,830 --> 01:36:29,840
thing you can make and a lot of that is
 

4601
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,830
thing you can make and a lot of that is
driven by how much energy or how much

4602
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:32,840
driven by how much energy or how much
 

4603
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,830
driven by how much energy or how much
power you can supply to it and how you

4604
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:34,840
power you can supply to it and how you
 

4605
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:37,629
power you can supply to it and how you
extract data from it so at the time at

4606
01:36:37,629 --> 01:36:37,639
extract data from it so at the time at
 

4607

Berkeley there was kind of this this uh

4608
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:40,400
Berkeley there was kind of this this uh
 

4609
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,070

Michelle came in and he's like guys I

4622
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:55,920
Michelle came in and he's like guys I
 

4623
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,229
Michelle came in and he's like guys I
think I have a

4624
01:36:57,229 --> 01:36:57,239
think I have a
 

4625
01:36:57,239 --> 01:36:59,830
think I have a
solution the solution is

4626
01:36:59,830 --> 01:36:59,840
solution the solution is
 

4627
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,030
solution the solution is
ultrasound and uh and then he proceeded

4628
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:03,040
ultrasound and uh and then he proceeded
 

4629
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,510
ultrasound and uh and then he proceeded
to kind of walk through why that is the

4630
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:05,520
to kind of walk through why that is the
 

4631
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,550
to kind of walk through why that is the
case and that that really formed the

4632
01:37:07,550 --> 01:37:07,560
case and that that really formed the
 

4633
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,669
case and that that really formed the
basis for my thesis work um uh called

4634
01:37:10,669 --> 01:37:10,679
basis for my thesis work um uh called
 

4635
01:37:10,679 --> 01:37:13,510
basis for my thesis work um uh called
neural dust system that was looking at

4636
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520

well as communication I guess I should
 

4643
01:37:21,239 --> 01:37:23,750
well as communication I guess I should
step back and say the the initial goal

4644
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:23,760
step back and say the the initial goal
 

4645
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,149
step back and say the the initial goal
of the project was to build these

4646
01:37:27,149 --> 01:37:27,159
of the project was to build these
 

4647
01:37:27,159 --> 01:37:29,629

01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:50,040
get the data off of it and at the end of
 

4665
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,310
get the data off of it and at the end of

essentially bag of salt water with some
 

4671
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,310
essentially bag of salt water with some
interesting proteins and chemicals but

4672
01:37:58,310 --> 01:37:58,320
interesting proteins and chemicals but
 

4673
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,229
interesting proteins and chemicals but
uh it's mostly salt water that's very

4674
01:38:01,229 --> 01:38:01,239
uh it's mostly salt water that's very
 

4675
01:38:01,239 --> 01:38:05,550
uh it's mostly salt water that's very
very well temperature regulated at 37° c

4676
01:38:05,550 --> 01:38:05,560
very well temperature regulated at 37° c
 

4677
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:08,149
very well temperature regulated at 37° c
um and we'll we'll get into how why and

4678
01:38:08,149 --> 01:38:08,159
um and we'll we'll get into how why and
 

4679
01:38:08,159 --> 01:38:10,229
um and we'll we'll get into how why and
and later why that's a an extremely

4680
01:38:10,229 --> 01:38:10,239
and later why that's a an extremely
 

4681
01:38:10,239 --> 01:38:12,070
and later why that's a an extremely
harsh environment for any Electronics to

4682
01:38:12,070 --> 01:38:12,080
harsh environment for any Electronics to
 

4683
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,669
harsh environment for any Electronics to
survive as I'm sure you've experienced

4684
01:38:15,669 --> 01:38:15,679
survive as I'm sure you've experienced
 

4685
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:16,950
survive as I'm sure you've experienced
or maybe not experienced you know

4686
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:16,960
or maybe not experienced you know
 

4687
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,229
or maybe not experienced you know
dropping cell phone in a in a salt water

4688
01:38:19,229 --> 01:38:19,239
dropping cell phone in a in a salt water
 

4689
01:38:19,239 --> 01:38:21,149
dropping cell phone in a in a salt water
in an ocean it will instantly kill the

4690
01:38:21,149 --> 01:38:21,159
in an ocean it will instantly kill the
 

4691
01:38:21,159 --> 01:38:25,629
in an ocean it will instantly kill the
device right um but anyways uh just in

4692
01:38:25,629 --> 01:38:25,639
device right um but anyways uh just in
 

4693
01:38:25,639 --> 01:38:27,390
device right um but anyways uh just in
general electromagnetic waves don't

4694
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:27,400
general electromagnetic waves don't
 

4695
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,950
general electromagnetic waves don't
penetrate through this environment well

4696
01:38:29,950 --> 01:38:29,960
penetrate through this environment well
 

4697
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,629
penetrate through this environment well
um

4698
01:38:31,629 --> 01:38:31,639
um
 

4699
01:38:31,639 --> 01:38:34,070
um
and just the speed of light it is what

4700
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:34,080
and just the speed of light it is what
 

4701
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:36,229
and just the speed of light it is what
it is we can't we can't change it and

4702
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
it is we can't we can't change it and
 

4703
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:40,750
it is we can't we can't change it and
based on the um the wavelength at which

4704
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:40,760
based on the um the wavelength at which
 

4705
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:43,270
based on the um the wavelength at which
you are interfacing with the device it

4706
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:43,280
you are interfacing with the device it
 

4707
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:44,709
you are interfacing with the device it
the device just needs to be big like

4708
01:38:44,709 --> 01:38:44,719
the device just needs to be big like
 

4709
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:46,990
the device just needs to be big like
these inductors needs to be quite big um

4710
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:47,000
these inductors needs to be quite big um
 

4711
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,310
these inductors needs to be quite big um
and the general good rule of thumb is

4712
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:49,320
and the general good rule of thumb is
 

4713
01:38:49,320 --> 01:38:52,390
and the general good rule of thumb is
that you want the wavefront to be

4714
01:38:52,390 --> 01:38:52,400
that you want the wavefront to be
 

4715
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:54,229
that you want the wavefront to be
roughly on the order of of the size of

4716
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:54,239
roughly on the order of of the size of
 

4717
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:56,229
roughly on the order of of the size of
the thing that you're interfacing with

4718
01:38:56,229 --> 01:38:56,239
the thing that you're interfacing with
 

4719
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,870
the thing that you're interfacing with
so an implantable system uh that is

4720
01:38:59,870 --> 01:38:59,880
so an implantable system uh that is
 

4721
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:03,390
so an implantable system uh that is
around 10 to 100 Micron in dimension in

4722
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:03,400
around 10 to 100 Micron in dimension in
 

4723
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,270
around 10 to 100 Micron in dimension in
in in a volume which is about the size

4724
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:05,280
in in a volume which is about the size
 

4725
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,510
in in a volume which is about the size
of a neuron that you see in um in a

4726
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:07,520
of a neuron that you see in um in a
 

4727
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:11,149
of a neuron that you see in um in a
human body um you would have to operate

4728
01:39:11,149 --> 01:39:11,159
human body um you would have to operate
 

4729
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,950
human body um you would have to operate
at like hundreds of gigahertz which

4730
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:13,960
at like hundreds of gigahertz which
 

4731
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,070
at like hundreds of gigahertz which
number one not only is it difficult to

4732
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:16,080
number one not only is it difficult to
 

4733
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,229
number one not only is it difficult to
build Electronics operating at those

4734
01:39:18,229 --> 01:39:18,239
build Electronics operating at those
 

4735
01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:20,430
build Electronics operating at those
frequencies but also the body just

4736
01:39:20,430 --> 01:39:20,440
frequencies but also the body just
 

4737
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,589
frequencies but also the body just
attenuates that very very significantly

4738
01:39:23,589 --> 01:39:23,599
attenuates that very very significantly
 

4739
01:39:23,599 --> 01:39:26,149
attenuates that very very significantly
so the interesting kind of insight of

4740
01:39:26,149 --> 01:39:26,159
so the interesting kind of insight of
 

4741
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:29,470
so the interesting kind of insight of
this ultrasound um was the fact

4742
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:29,480
this ultrasound um was the fact
 

4743
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:32,310
this ultrasound um was the fact
that ultrasound just travels a lot more

4744
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:32,320
that ultrasound just travels a lot more
 

4745
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,629
that ultrasound just travels a lot more
effectively in the human body tissue

4746
01:39:34,629 --> 01:39:34,639
effectively in the human body tissue
 

4747
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,390
effectively in the human body tissue
compared to electromagnetic waves and

4748
01:39:37,390 --> 01:39:37,400
compared to electromagnetic waves and
 

4749
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,950
compared to electromagnetic waves and
this is something that you

4750
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:38,960
this is something that you
 

4751
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:41,709
this is something that you
encounter uh and you I'm sure most

4752
01:39:41,709 --> 01:39:41,719
encounter uh and you I'm sure most
 

4753
01:39:41,719 --> 01:39:43,589
encounter uh and you I'm sure most
people have encounter in their lives

4754
01:39:43,589 --> 01:39:43,599
people have encounter in their lives
 

4755
01:39:43,599 --> 01:39:46,070
people have encounter in their lives
when you go to um you know hospitals

4756
01:39:46,070 --> 01:39:46,080
when you go to um you know hospitals
 

4757
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:49,430
when you go to um you know hospitals
that are medical uh ultrasound you know

4758
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:49,440
that are medical uh ultrasound you know
 

4759
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:54,589
that are medical uh ultrasound you know
sonograph right um and they go into very

4760
01:39:54,589 --> 01:39:54,599
sonograph right um and they go into very
 

4761
01:39:54,599 --> 01:39:56,709
sonograph right um and they go into very
very deep depth without attenuating too

4762
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:56,719
very deep depth without attenuating too
 

4763
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:00,189
very deep depth without attenuating too
much too much of the signal so all in

4764
01:40:00,189 --> 01:40:00,199
much too much of the signal so all in
 

4765
01:40:00,199 --> 01:40:02,550
much too much of the signal so all in
all you know we'll just sound the fact

4766
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:02,560
all you know we'll just sound the fact
 

4767
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:04,709
all you know we'll just sound the fact
that it travels through the body

4768
01:40:04,709 --> 01:40:04,719
that it travels through the body
 

4769
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:06,470
that it travels through the body
extremely well and the mechanism to

4770
01:40:06,470 --> 01:40:06,480
extremely well and the mechanism to
 

4771
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,629
extremely well and the mechanism to
which it travels to the body really well

4772
01:40:08,629 --> 01:40:08,639
which it travels to the body really well
 

4773
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:10,750
which it travels to the body really well
is that just the wavefront is very

4774
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:10,760
is that just the wavefront is very
 

4775
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,910
is that just the wavefront is very
different it's uh electromagnetic waves

4776
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:13,920
different it's uh electromagnetic waves
 

4777
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,149
different it's uh electromagnetic waves
are transverse whereas in ultrasound

4778
01:40:16,149 --> 01:40:16,159
are transverse whereas in ultrasound
 

4779
01:40:16,159 --> 01:40:18,390
are transverse whereas in ultrasound
waves are compressive so it's just a

4780
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:18,400
waves are compressive so it's just a
 

4781
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:21,189
waves are compressive so it's just a
completely different mode of uh

4782
01:40:21,189 --> 01:40:21,199
completely different mode of uh
 

4783
01:40:21,199 --> 01:40:24,830
completely different mode of uh
wavefront propagation um and as well as

4784
01:40:24,830 --> 01:40:24,840
wavefront propagation um and as well as
 

4785
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:27,910
wavefront propagation um and as well as
speed of sound is orders and Orders of

4786
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:27,920
speed of sound is orders and Orders of
 

4787
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:30,149
speed of sound is orders and Orders of
magnitude less than speed of light which

4788
01:40:30,149 --> 01:40:30,159
magnitude less than speed of light which
 

4789
01:40:30,159 --> 01:40:32,430
magnitude less than speed of light which
means that even at 10 megahertz

4790
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:32,440
means that even at 10 megahertz
 

4791
01:40:32,440 --> 01:40:34,750
means that even at 10 megahertz
ultrasound wave your wavefront

4792
01:40:34,750 --> 01:40:34,760
ultrasound wave your wavefront
 

4793
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:36,709
ultrasound wave your wavefront
ultimately is a very very small

4794
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
ultimately is a very very small
 

4795
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,390
ultimately is a very very small
wavelength so if you're talking about

4796
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:39,400
wavelength so if you're talking about
 

4797
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:41,470
wavelength so if you're talking about
interfacing with the 10 Micron or 100

4798
01:40:41,470 --> 01:40:41,480
interfacing with the 10 Micron or 100
 

4799
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:44,390
interfacing with the 10 Micron or 100
Micron type

4800
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,400
Micron type
 

4801
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,669
Micron type
structure you would have 150 Micron wave

4802
01:40:47,669 --> 01:40:47,679
structure you would have 150 Micron wave
 

4803
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:50,390
structure you would have 150 Micron wave
front at 10 MHz and building electronics

4804
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:50,400
front at 10 MHz and building electronics
 

4805
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,229
front at 10 MHz and building electronics
at those Mega uh at those frequencies

4806
01:40:52,229 --> 01:40:52,239
at those Mega uh at those frequencies
 

4807
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:54,070
at those Mega uh at those frequencies
are much much easier and they're a lot

4808
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,080
are much much easier and they're a lot
 

4809
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,870
are much much easier and they're a lot
more efficient so the basic idea kind of

4810
01:40:57,870 --> 01:40:57,880
more efficient so the basic idea kind of
 

4811
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:01,030
more efficient so the basic idea kind of
was born out of um you know using

4812
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:01,040
was born out of um you know using
 

4813
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,950
was born out of um you know using
ultrasound as a mechanism for powering

4814
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:02,960
ultrasound as a mechanism for powering
 

4815
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,510
ultrasound as a mechanism for powering
the device and then also getting data

4816
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:05,520
the device and then also getting data
 

4817
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:06,990
the device and then also getting data
back so now the question is how do you

4818
01:41:06,990 --> 01:41:07,000
back so now the question is how do you
 

4819
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,669
back so now the question is how do you
get the data back the mechanism to which

4820
01:41:09,669 --> 01:41:09,679
get the data back the mechanism to which
 

4821
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:11,350
get the data back the mechanism to which
we landed on is what's called back

4822
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
we landed on is what's called back
 

4823
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:14,229
we landed on is what's called back
scattering um this is actually something

4824
01:41:14,229 --> 01:41:14,239
scattering um this is actually something
 

4825
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,629
scattering um this is actually something
that is very common and that we

4826
01:41:16,629 --> 01:41:16,639
that is very common and that we
 

4827
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:19,189
that is very common and that we
interface on a day-to-day basis with our

4828
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
interface on a day-to-day basis with our
 

4829
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,550
interface on a day-to-day basis with our
RFID cards you know our radio frequency

4830
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:21,560
RFID cards you know our radio frequency
 

4831
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:24,030
RFID cards you know our radio frequency
ID tags where

4832
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:24,040
ID tags where
 

4833
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:26,470
ID tags where
there's actually rarely you know in your

4834
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:26,480
there's actually rarely you know in your
 

4835
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,790
there's actually rarely you know in your
ID a battery inside there's an antenna

4836
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:29,800
ID a battery inside there's an antenna
 

4837
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:33,030
ID a battery inside there's an antenna
and there's some sort of uh coil that

4838
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,040
and there's some sort of uh coil that
 

4839
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:37,070
and there's some sort of uh coil that
has your serial uh identification ID and

4840
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:37,080
has your serial uh identification ID and
 

4841
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,350
has your serial uh identification ID and
then there's an external device called

4842
01:41:38,350 --> 01:41:38,360
then there's an external device called
 

4843
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:41,750
then there's an external device called
the reader that then sends a wavefront

4844
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:41,760
the reader that then sends a wavefront
 

4845
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,990
the reader that then sends a wavefront
and then you reflect back that wavefront

4846
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,000
and then you reflect back that wavefront
 

4847
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,430
and then you reflect back that wavefront
with some sort of modulation that's

4848
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:45,440
with some sort of modulation that's
 

4849
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,910
with some sort of modulation that's
unique to your ID that's that's what's

4850
01:41:47,910 --> 01:41:47,920
unique to your ID that's that's what's
 

4851
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,709
unique to your ID that's that's what's
called back scattering uh fundamentally

4852
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
called back scattering uh fundamentally
 

4853
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,790
called back scattering uh fundamentally
so the tag itself actually doesn't have

4854
01:41:52,790 --> 01:41:52,800
so the tag itself actually doesn't have
 

4855
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,750
so the tag itself actually doesn't have
to cons consume that much energy and um

4856
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:56,760
to cons consume that much energy and um
 

4857
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,510
to cons consume that much energy and um
that was a mechanism to which we were

4858
01:41:58,510 --> 01:41:58,520
that was a mechanism to which we were
 

4859
01:41:58,520 --> 01:41:59,950
that was a mechanism to which we were
kind of thinking about sending the data

4860
01:41:59,950 --> 01:41:59,960
kind of thinking about sending the data
 

4861
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:01,910
kind of thinking about sending the data
back so when you have an external uh

4862
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:01,920
back so when you have an external uh
 

4863
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,910
back so when you have an external uh
ultrasonic transducer that's sending

4864
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:04,920
ultrasonic transducer that's sending
 

4865
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,470
ultrasonic transducer that's sending
ultrasonic wave to your implant the

4866
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:07,480
ultrasonic wave to your implant the
 

4867
01:42:07,480 --> 01:42:10,950
ultrasonic wave to your implant the
neural dust implant and it records some

4868
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:10,960
neural dust implant and it records some
 

4869
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,870
neural dust implant and it records some
information about its environment

4870
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:12,880
information about its environment
 

4871
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:15,229
information about its environment
whether it's a neuron firing or uh some

4872
01:42:15,229 --> 01:42:15,239
whether it's a neuron firing or uh some
 

4873
01:42:15,239 --> 01:42:17,950
whether it's a neuron firing or uh some
other state of

01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:17,960
other state of
 

4875
01:42:17,960 --> 01:42:20,310
other state of
um the uh the tissue that it's

4876
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
um the uh the tissue that it's
 

4877
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,350
um the uh the tissue that it's
interfacing with and then it just

4878
01:42:22,350 --> 01:42:22,360
interfacing with and then it just
 

4879
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,229
interfacing with and then it just
amplitude modul

the wfront that comes back to the source

4882
01:42:27,109 --> 01:42:27,119
the wfront that comes back to the source
 

4883
01:42:27,119 --> 01:42:29,550
the wfront that comes back to the source
and the recording step would be the only

4884
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:29,560
and the recording step would be the only
 

4885
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,589
and the recording step would be the only
one that requires any energy so what

4886
01:42:31,589 --> 01:42:31,599
one that requires any energy so what
 

4887
01:42:31,599 --> 01:42:33,709
one that requires any energy so what
would require energy in that little step

4888
01:42:33,709 --> 01:42:33,719
would require energy in that little step
 

4889
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:36,189
would require energy in that little step
correct so it it is that initial kind of

4890
01:42:36,189 --> 01:42:36,199
correct so it it is that initial kind of
 

4891
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:39,310
correct so it it is that initial kind of
startup circuitry to get that recording

4892
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:39,320
startup circuitry to get that recording
 

4893
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,910

amplifying it and then just modulating

4894
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:41,920
amplifying it and then just modulating
 

4895
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,109
amplifying it and then just modulating
MH and the mechanism to which that that

4896
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:45,119
MH and the mechanism to which that that
 

4897
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:46,870
MH and the mechanism to which that that
you can enable that is there is the

4898
01:42:46,870 --> 01:42:46,880
you can enable that is there is the
 

4899
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,189
you can enable that is there is the

uh as you get closer to the source let's

4994
01:44:56,149 --> 01:44:56,159
uh as you get closer to the source let's
 

4995
01:44:56,159 --> 01:45:00,350
uh as you get closer to the source let's
say and in the 1950s um these two

4996

01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,910
opis um that discovered that there's
this thing called motor tuning curve so

5102
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:20,920
this thing called motor tuning curve so
 

5103
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,669
this thing called motor tuning curve so
what are motor tuning curves it's the

5104
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:22,679
what are motor tuning curves it's the
 

5105
01:47:22,679 --> 01:47:24,589
what are motor tuning curves it's the
fact that there are you know neurons in

5106
01:47:24,589 --> 01:47:24,599
fact that there are you know neurons in
 

5107
01:47:24,599 --> 01:47:27,589
fact that there are you know neurons in

direction that causes them to fire so
 

5113
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,310
direction that causes them to fire so
what that means is there are a set of

01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:34,320
what that means is there are a set of
 

5115
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,510
what that means is there are a set of
neurons that would uh increase their

that you know you could start to think
 

5125
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:51,870

5129
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,750
essential igon detectors you can do a
lot and you can actually use that

5130
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:55,760

5136
01:48:02,470 --> 01:48:02,480
cortex so that was a very very seminal
 

5137
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:06,390
cortex so that was a very very seminal
kind of paper that showed um that uh

5138
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:06,400
kind of paper that showed um that uh
 

5139
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:08,310
kind of paper that showed um that uh
there there is some sort of code that

5140
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:08,320
there there is some sort of code that
 

5141
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,629
there there is some sort of code that
you can you can extract especially in

5142
01:48:10,629 --> 01:48:10,639
you can you can extract especially in
 

5143
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:13,430
you can you can extract especially in
the motor cortex so there's signal there

5144
01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:13,440
the motor cortex so there's signal there
 

5145
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,430
the motor cortex so there's signal there
and if you measure uh the the electrical

5146
01:48:16,430 --> 01:48:16,440
and if you measure uh the the electrical
 

5147
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,350
and if you measure uh the the electrical
signal from the brain that you could you

5148
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:18,360
signal from the brain that you could you
 

5149
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:19,750
signal from the brain that you could you
could actually figure out what the

5150
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:19,760
could actually figure out what the
 

5151
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,669
could actually figure out what the
intention was correct yeah not only

5152
01:48:21,669 --> 01:48:21,679

neuralink uh one interesting question is
what do I understand on the BCI front on

5164
01:48:37,390 --> 01:48:37,400
what do I understand on the BCI front on
 

5165
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:40,709
what do I understand on the BCI front on
invasive versus noninvasive from this

5166
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:40,719
invasive versus noninvasive from this
 

5167
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:44,950
invasive versus noninvasive from this
line of work uh how important is it to

5168
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:44,960
line of work uh how important is it to
 

5169
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,790
line of work uh how important is it to
to park next to the neuron what does

5170
01:48:47,790 --> 01:48:47,800
to park next to the neuron what does
 

5171
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,589
to park next to the neuron what does
that get you that answer fundamentally

5172
01:48:50,589 --> 01:48:50,599
that get you that answer fundamentally
 

5173
01:48:50,599 --> 01:48:52,390
that get you that answer fundamentally
depends on what you want to do with it

5174
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:52,400
depends on what you want to do with it
 

5175
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,870
depends on what you want to do with it
right um there's actually incredible

5176
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:54,880
right um there's actually incredible
 

5177
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,629
right um there's actually incredible
amount of stuff that you can do with EEG

5178
01:48:56,629 --> 01:48:56,639
amount of stuff that you can do with EEG
 

5179
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:00,030
amount of stuff that you can do with EEG
and um electrograph ecog which actually

5180
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:00,040
and um electrograph ecog which actually
 

5181
01:49:00,040 --> 01:49:02,430
and um electrograph ecog which actually
doesn't penetrate the the cortical layer

5182
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:02,440
doesn't penetrate the the cortical layer
 

5183
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:05,229
doesn't penetrate the the cortical layer
or panoma um but you place a set of

5184
01:49:05,229 --> 01:49:05,239
or panoma um but you place a set of
 

5185
01:49:05,239 --> 01:49:07,950
or panoma um but you place a set of
electrodes on the surface of the brain

5186
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:07,960
electrodes on the surface of the brain
 

5187
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:09,830
electrodes on the surface of the brain
so the thing that I'm personally very

5188
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
so the thing that I'm personally very
 

5189
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,310
so the thing that I'm personally very
interested in is just actually

5190
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:12,320
interested in is just actually
 

5191
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,030
interested in is just actually
understanding

5192
01:49:14,030 --> 01:49:14,040
understanding
 

5193
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:17,149
understanding
um and and being able to just really tap

5194
01:49:17,149 --> 01:49:17,159
um and and being able to just really tap
 

5195
01:49:17,159 --> 01:49:20,229
um and and being able to just really tap
into the high resolution High Fidelity

5196
01:49:20,229 --> 01:49:20,239
into the high resolution High Fidelity
 

5197
01:49:20,239 --> 01:49:21,390
into the high resolution High Fidelity
understanding of the activities that are

5198
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:21,400
understanding of the activities that are
 

5199
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:23,830
understanding of the activities that are
happening at the local level

5200
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:23,840
happening at the local level
 

5201
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,229
happening at the local level
and you know we can get into biophysics

5202
01:49:26,229 --> 01:49:26,239
and you know we can get into biophysics
 

5203
01:49:26,239 --> 01:49:28,270
and you know we can get into biophysics
but just to kind of step back um to kind

5204
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:28,280
but just to kind of step back um to kind
 

5205
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:30,709
but just to kind of step back um to kind
of use analogy because analogy here can

5206
01:49:30,709 --> 01:49:30,719
of use analogy because analogy here can
 

5207
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:32,510
of use analogy because analogy here can
be useful sometimes it's a little bit

5208
01:49:32,510 --> 01:49:32,520
be useful sometimes it's a little bit
 

5209
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,189
be useful sometimes it's a little bit
difficult to think about electricity um

5210
01:49:34,189 --> 01:49:34,199
difficult to think about electricity um
 

5211
01:49:34,199 --> 01:49:34,950
difficult to think about electricity um
at the end of the day we're doing

5212
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:34,960
at the end of the day we're doing
 

5213
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:36,950
at the end of the day we're doing
electrical recording that's mediated by

5214
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:36,960
electrical recording that's mediated by
 

5215
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:39,669
electrical recording that's mediated by
ionic um currents you know movements of

5216
01:49:39,669 --> 01:49:39,679
ionic um currents you know movements of
 

5217
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:42,189
ionic um currents you know movements of
these charged particles um which is

5218
01:49:42,189 --> 01:49:42,199
these charged particles um which is
 

5219
01:49:42,199 --> 01:49:43,830
these charged particles um which is
really really hard for most people to

5220
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:43,840
really really hard for most people to
 

5221
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,790
really really hard for most people to
think about um but turns out a lot of

5222
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:46,800
think about um but turns out a lot of
 

5223
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,910
think about um but turns out a lot of
the activities

5224
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:48,920
the activities
 

5225
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,870
the activities
um that are happening in the brain and

5226
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:51,880
um that are happening in the brain and
 

5227
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:53,750
um that are happening in the brain and
the frequency band with which that's

5228
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:53,760
the frequency band with which that's
 

5229
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,350
the frequency band with which that's
happening is actually very very similar

5230
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:55,360
happening is actually very very similar
 

5231
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:57,350
happening is actually very very similar
to sound waves and and you know our

5232
01:49:57,350 --> 01:49:57,360
to sound waves and and you know our
 

5233
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:01,149
to sound waves and and you know our
normal conversation um audible L range

5234
01:50:01,149 --> 01:50:01,159
normal conversation um audible L range
 

5235
01:50:01,159 --> 01:50:03,709
normal conversation um audible L range
so the analogy that typically is used in

5236
01:50:03,709 --> 01:50:03,719
so the analogy that typically is used in
 

5237
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:06,870
so the analogy that typically is used in
the field is you if you if you have a

5238
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:06,880
the field is you if you if you have a
 

5239
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,910
the field is you if you if you have a
football

5240
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:07,920
football
 

5241
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:10,229
football
stadium uh you know there's game going

5242
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:10,239
stadium uh you know there's game going
 

5243
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:12,149
stadium uh you know there's game going
on if you stand outside the stadium you

5244
01:50:12,149 --> 01:50:12,159
on if you stand outside the stadium you
 

5245
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:14,109
on if you stand outside the stadium you
you maybe get a sense of how the game is

5246
01:50:14,109 --> 01:50:14,119
you maybe get a sense of how the game is
 

5247
01:50:14,119 --> 01:50:15,709
you maybe get a sense of how the game is
going based on the cheers and the booze

5248
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:15,719
going based on the cheers and the booze
 

5249
01:50:15,719 --> 01:50:17,470
going based on the cheers and the booze
of the home crowd whether the team is

5250
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:17,480
of the home crowd whether the team is
 

5251
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:20,270
of the home crowd whether the team is
winning or not but you have absolutely

5252
01:50:20,270 --> 01:50:20,280
winning or not but you have absolutely
 

5253
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,149
winning or not but you have absolutely
no idea what the score is you have

5254
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:22,159
no idea what the score is you have
 

5255
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:25,589
no idea what the score is you have
absolutely no idea what um individual

5256
01:50:25,589 --> 01:50:25,599
absolutely no idea what um individual
 

5257
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:27,910
absolutely no idea what um individual
audience or the players are talking or

5258
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:27,920
audience or the players are talking or
 

5259
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,430
audience or the players are talking or
saying to each other what the next play

5260
01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:29,440
saying to each other what the next play
 

5261
01:50:29,440 --> 01:50:32,550
saying to each other what the next play
is what the next goal is um so what you

5262
01:50:32,550 --> 01:50:32,560
is what the next goal is um so what you
 

5263
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:33,870
is what the next goal is um so what you
have to do is you have to drop the

5264
01:50:33,870 --> 01:50:33,880
have to do is you have to drop the
 

5265
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,950
have to do is you have to drop the
microphone near into the stadium and

5266
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:36,960
microphone near into the stadium and
 

5267
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,470
microphone near into the stadium and
then get near the source like into the

5268
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:39,480
then get near the source like into the
 

5269
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:41,870
then get near the source like into the
individual chatter um in this specific

5270
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:41,880
individual chatter um in this specific
 

5271
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,629
individual chatter um in this specific
example you would want to have it you

5272
01:50:43,629 --> 01:50:43,639
example you would want to have it you
 

5273
01:50:43,639 --> 01:50:45,149
example you would want to have it you
know right next to where the Huddle is

5274
01:50:45,149 --> 01:50:45,159
know right next to where the Huddle is
 

5275
01:50:45,159 --> 01:50:48,870
know right next to where the Huddle is
happening M um so I I think that's kind

5276
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:48,880
happening M um so I I think that's kind
 

5277
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,950
happening M um so I I think that's kind
of a good illustration of what we're

5278
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:50,960
of a good illustration of what we're
 

5279
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,550
of a good illustration of what we're
trying to do um when we say

5280
01:50:53,550 --> 01:50:53,560
trying to do um when we say
 

5281
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:55,629
trying to do um when we say
invasive or minimally invasive or

5282
01:50:55,629 --> 01:50:55,639
invasive or minimally invasive or
 

5283
01:50:55,639 --> 01:50:57,750
invasive or minimally invasive or
implanted brain computer interfaces

5284
01:50:57,750 --> 01:50:57,760
implanted brain computer interfaces
 

5285
01:50:57,760 --> 01:51:00,830
implanted brain computer interfaces
versus noninvasive or non-implanted uh

5286
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:00,840
versus noninvasive or non-implanted uh
 

5287
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:03,550
versus noninvasive or non-implanted uh
brain interfaces it's basically talking

5288
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:03,560
brain interfaces it's basically talking
 

5289
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,350
brain interfaces it's basically talking
about where do you put that microphone

5290
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,360
about where do you put that microphone
 

5291
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,390
about where do you put that microphone
and what can you do with that

5292
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:06,400
and what can you do with that
 

5293
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,950
and what can you do with that
information so what what is the

5294
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:08,960
information so what what is the
 

5295
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,390
information so what what is the
biophysics of the read and write

5296
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:11,400
biophysics of the read and write
 

5297
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,069
biophysics of the read and write
communication that we're talking about

5298
01:51:13,069 --> 01:51:13,079
communication that we're talking about
 

5299
01:51:13,079 --> 01:51:16,750
communication that we're talking about
here as we now step into the efforts at

5300
01:51:16,750 --> 01:51:16,760
here as we now step into the efforts at
 

5301
01:51:16,760 --> 01:51:23,589
here as we now step into the efforts at
neur link yeah so uh brain is made of of

5302
01:51:23,589 --> 01:51:23,599
neur link yeah so uh brain is made of of
 

5303
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,910
neur link yeah so uh brain is made of of
these specialized cells called neurons

5304
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:25,920
these specialized cells called neurons
 

5305
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:28,470
these specialized cells called neurons
there's billions of them you know tens

5306
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:28,480
there's billions of them you know tens
 

5307
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:29,950
there's billions of them you know tens
of billions you know sometimes people

5308
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:29,960
of billions you know sometimes people
 

5309
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:33,669
of billions you know sometimes people
quote 100 billion that are connected in

5310
01:51:33,669 --> 01:51:33,679
quote 100 billion that are connected in
 

5311
01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:37,950
quote 100 billion that are connected in
this complex yet Dynamic network uh that

5312
01:51:37,950 --> 01:51:37,960
this complex yet Dynamic network uh that
 

5313
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:39,629
this complex yet Dynamic network uh that
are constantly remodeling you know

5314
01:51:39,629 --> 01:51:39,639
are constantly remodeling you know
 

5315
01:51:39,639 --> 01:51:41,870
are constantly remodeling you know
they're changing their synaptic weights

5316
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:41,880
they're changing their synaptic weights
 

5317
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:44,270
they're changing their synaptic weights
um and that's you know what we typically

5318
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:44,280
um and that's you know what we typically
 

5319
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:45,790
um and that's you know what we typically
call

way to have that very very early on in

5360
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:41,960
way to have that very very early on in
 

5361
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:44,830
way to have that very very early on in
its Evolution and as we all know with

5362
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:44,840
its Evolution and as we all know with
 

5363
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:46,750

um that that we have access to today so
 

5369
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:55,350
um that that we have access to today so
I I I I think I it's one of those just

5370
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:55,360
I I I I think I it's one of those just
 

5371
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:57,790
I I I I think I it's one of those just
as a tangent just a beautiful beautiful

5372
01:52:57,790 --> 01:52:57,800
as a tangent just a beautiful beautiful
 

5373
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,510
as a tangent just a beautiful beautiful
uh invention that the nature came up

5374
01:52:59,510 --> 01:52:59,520
uh invention that the nature came up
 

5375
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,189
uh invention that the nature came up
with these voltage gated ion channels I

5376
01:53:02,189 --> 01:53:02,199
with these voltage gated ion channels I
 

5377
01:53:02,199 --> 01:53:04,750
with these voltage gated ion channels I
mean I suppose there's on the biological

5378
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:04,760
mean I suppose there's on the biological
 

5379
01:53:04,760 --> 01:53:07,310
mean I suppose there's on the biological
level every level of the complexity of

5380
01:53:07,310 --> 01:53:07,320
level every level of the complexity of
 

5381
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:09,350
level every level of the complexity of
the hierarchy of the the organism

5382
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:09,360
the hierarchy of the the organism
 

5383
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:11,669
the hierarchy of the the organism
there's going to be some mechanisms for

5384
01:53:11,669 --> 01:53:11,679
there's going to be some mechanisms for
 

5385
01:53:11,679 --> 01:53:14,109
there's going to be some mechanisms for
storing information and for doing

5386
01:53:14,109 --> 01:53:14,119
storing information and for doing
 

5387
01:53:14,119 --> 01:53:16,350
storing information and for doing
computation and this is just one such

5388
01:53:16,350 --> 01:53:16,360
computation and this is just one such
 

5389
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:19,310
computation and this is just one such
way but to do that with uh biological

5390
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:19,320
way but to do that with uh biological
 

5391
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:21,470
way but to do that with uh biological
and chemical components is interesting

5392
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:21,480
and chemical components is interesting
 

5393
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:24,310
and chemical components is interesting
plus like with neurons I mean it's not

5394
01:53:24,310 --> 01:53:24,320
plus like with neurons I mean it's not
 

5395
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:27,350
plus like with neurons I mean it's not
just electricity it's uh chemical

5396
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:27,360
just electricity it's uh chemical
 

5397
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,589
just electricity it's uh chemical
communication it's also mechanical I

5398
01:53:29,589 --> 01:53:29,599
communication it's also mechanical I
 

5399
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:32,830
communication it's also mechanical I
mean these are like actual objects that

5400
01:53:32,830 --> 01:53:32,840
mean these are like actual objects that
 

5401
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:36,270
mean these are like actual objects that
have like that vibrate I mean they move

5402
01:53:36,270 --> 01:53:36,280
have like that vibrate I mean they move
 

5403
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:38,270
have like that vibrate I mean they move
yeah there actually I mean there's a lot

5404
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:38,280
yeah there actually I mean there's a lot
 

5405
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:40,310
yeah there actually I mean there's a lot
of really really interesting physics

5406
01:53:40,310 --> 01:53:40,320
of really really interesting physics
 

5407
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,350
of really really interesting physics
that that that are involved and you know

5408
01:53:42,350 --> 01:53:42,360
that that that are involved and you know
 

5409
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:45,109
that that that are involved and you know
kind of going back to my um work on

5410
01:53:45,109 --> 01:53:45,119
kind of going back to my um work on
 

5411
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:48,950
kind of going back to my um work on
ultrasound uh during grad school there

5412
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:48,960
ultrasound uh during grad school there
 

5413
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,790
ultrasound uh during grad school there
there are groups and uh there were

5414
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:50,800
there are groups and uh there were
 

5415
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,709
there are groups and uh there were
groups and there are still groups um

5416
01:53:52,709 --> 01:53:52,719
groups and there are still groups um
 

5417
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:55,790
groups and there are still groups um
looking at ways to cause neurons to

5418
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:55,800
looking at ways to cause neurons to
 

5419
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:58,510
looking at ways to cause neurons to
actually fire an action potential using

5420
01:53:58,510 --> 01:53:58,520
actually fire an action potential using
 

5421
01:53:58,520 --> 01:54:00,229
actually fire an action potential using
ultrasound wave and the mechanism to

5422
01:54:00,229 --> 01:54:00,239
ultrasound wave and the mechanism to
 

5423
01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:02,629
ultrasound wave and the mechanism to
which that's happening is still unclear

5424
01:54:02,629 --> 01:54:02,639
which that's happening is still unclear
 

5425
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:05,109
which that's happening is still unclear
as I understand um you know it may just

5426
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:05,119
as I understand um you know it may just
 

5427
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:06,589
as I understand um you know it may just
be that you know you're imparting some

5428
01:54:06,589 --> 01:54:06,599
be that you know you're imparting some
 

5429
01:54:06,599 --> 01:54:08,510
be that you know you're imparting some
sort of thermal energy and that causes

5430
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:08,520
sort of thermal energy and that causes
 

5431
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:10,510
sort of thermal energy and that causes
cells to depolarize in some interesting

5432
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:10,520
cells to depolarize in some interesting
 

5433
01:54:10,520 --> 01:54:14,030
cells to depolarize in some interesting
ways um but there are also these um ion

5434
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:14,040
ways um but there are also these um ion
 

5435
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,629
ways um but there are also these um ion
channels or even membranes that actually

5436
01:54:16,629 --> 01:54:16,639
channels or even membranes that actually
 

5437
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:18,830
channels or even membranes that actually
just open up its pore as they're being

5438
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:18,840
just open up its pore as they're being
 

5439
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:21,589
just open up its pore as they're being
mechanically like shook right vibrated

5440
01:54:21,589 --> 01:54:21,599
mechanically like shook right vibrated
 

5441
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:24,109
mechanically like shook right vibrated
so there's just a lot of you know

5442
01:54:24,109 --> 01:54:24,119
so there's just a lot of you know
 

5443
01:54:24,119 --> 01:54:26,069
so there's just a lot of you know
elements of these like move

5444
01:54:26,069 --> 01:54:26,079
elements of these like move
 

5445
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:28,430
elements of these like move
particles um which again like that's

5446
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:28,440
particles um which again like that's
 

5447
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,790
particles um which again like that's
governed by diffusion physics right uh

5448
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:30,800
governed by diffusion physics right uh
 

5449
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:32,950
governed by diffusion physics right uh
movements of particles and there's also

5450
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:32,960
movements of particles and there's also
 

5451
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:34,870
movements of particles and there's also
a lot of kind of interesting physics

5452
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:34,880
a lot of kind of interesting physics
 

5453
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:38,030
a lot of kind of interesting physics
there also not to mention as Roger penos

5454
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:38,040
there also not to mention as Roger penos
 

5455
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:41,069
there also not to mention as Roger penos
talks about the there might be some uh

5456
01:54:41,069 --> 01:54:41,079
talks about the there might be some uh
 

5457
01:54:41,079 --> 01:54:42,550
talks about the there might be some uh
beautiful weirdness in the quantum

5458
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:42,560
beautiful weirdness in the quantum
 

5459
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,950
beautiful weirdness in the quantum
mechanical effects of all of this and he

5460
01:54:44,950 --> 01:54:44,960
mechanical effects of all of this and he
 

5461
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,589
mechanical effects of all of this and he
he actually believes that Consciousness

5462
01:54:46,589 --> 01:54:46,599
he actually believes that Consciousness
 

5463
01:54:46,599 --> 01:54:48,589
he actually believes that Consciousness
might emerge from the quantum mechanical

5464
01:54:48,589 --> 01:54:48,599
might emerge from the quantum mechanical
 

5465
01:54:48,599 --> 01:54:51,109
might emerge from the quantum mechanical
effects there so like there's physics

5466
01:54:51,109 --> 01:54:51,119
effects there so like there's physics
 

5467
01:54:51,119 --> 01:54:53,470
effects there so like there's physics
there's chemistry there bi all of that

5468
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:53,480
there's chemistry there bi all of that
 

5469
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:55,470
there's chemistry there bi all of that
is going on there oh yeah yeah I mean

5470
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:55,480
is going on there oh yeah yeah I mean
 

5471
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:58,149
is going on there oh yeah yeah I mean
you can yes I there's there's a lot of

5472
01:54:58,149 --> 01:54:58,159
you can yes I there's there's a lot of
 

5473
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:00,950
you can yes I there's there's a lot of
levels of physics that you can dive into

5474
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:00,960
levels of physics that you can dive into
 

5475
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:03,750
levels of physics that you can dive into
but yeah in the end you have these um uh

5476
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:03,760
but yeah in the end you have these um uh
 

5477
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,990
but yeah in the end you have these um uh
membranes with these voltage gated ion

5478
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
membranes with these voltage gated ion
 

5479

there's some sort of stimuli that
 

5495
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:33,350
there's some sort of stimuli that
changes uh the state such that they need

you have a depolarizing cell that sends
 

5515
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:54,709
you have a depolarizing cell that sends

5631
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:21,149
electrodes and then you're listening to
the chatter yeah you want to listen to

5632
01:58:21,149 --> 01:58:21,159
the chatter yeah you want to listen to
 

5633
01:58:21,159 --> 01:58:22,790
the chatter yeah you want to listen to
the chatter and and at the end of the

5634
01:58:22,790 --> 01:58:22,800
the chatter and and at the end of the
 

5635
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,109
the chatter and and at the end of the
day you also want to basically let the

5636
01:58:25,109 --> 01:58:25,119
day you also want to basically let the
 

5637
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:27,709
day you also want to basically let the
software do the do the job of decoding

5638
01:58:27,709 --> 01:58:27,719
software do the do the job of decoding
 

5639
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:32,149
software do the do the job of decoding
um and um just to kind of go to you know

5640
01:58:32,149 --> 01:58:32,159
um and um just to kind of go to you know
 

5641
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:36,790
um and um just to kind of go to you know
why EOG and EEG work at all right um

5642
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:36,800
why EOG and EEG work at all right um
 

5643
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,350
why EOG and EEG work at all right um
when you have these local changes you

5644
01:58:38,350 --> 01:58:38,360
when you have these local changes you
 

5645
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:40,189
when you have these local changes you
know obviously it's not just this one

5646
01:58:40,189 --> 01:58:40,199
know obviously it's not just this one
 

5647
01:58:40,199 --> 01:58:42,430
know obviously it's not just this one
neuron that's uh activating there's many

5648
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:42,440
neuron that's uh activating there's many
 

5649
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:44,270
neuron that's uh activating there's many
many other networks that are activating

5650
01:58:44,270 --> 01:58:44,280
many other networks that are activating
 

5651
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:47,069
many other networks that are activating
all the time and you do see sort of a

5652
01:58:47,069 --> 01:58:47,079
all the time and you do see sort of a
 

5653
01:58:47,079 --> 01:58:50,350
all the time and you do see sort of a
general change in the potential of this

5654
01:58:50,350 --> 01:58:50,360
general change in the potential of this
 

5655
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:52,790
general change in the potential of this
Electro like this charge medium

5656
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:52,800
Electro like this charge medium
 

5657
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:53,870
Electro like this charge medium
and that's what you're recording when

5658
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:53,880
and that's what you're recording when
 

5659
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,669
and that's what you're recording when
you're farther away I mean you you still

5660
01:58:55,669 --> 01:58:55,679
you're farther away I mean you you still
 

5661
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:57,589
you're farther away I mean you you still
have some reference Electro that's uh

5662
01:58:57,589 --> 01:58:57,599
have some reference Electro that's uh
 

5663
01:58:57,599 --> 01:58:59,470
have some reference Electro that's uh
stable and the Brain that's just

5664
01:58:59,470 --> 01:58:59,480
stable and the Brain that's just
 

5665
01:58:59,480 --> 01:59:01,990
stable and the Brain that's just
electroactive organ and you're seeing

5666
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:02,000
electroactive organ and you're seeing
 

5667
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,750
electroactive organ and you're seeing
some combination aggregate uh action

5668
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:04,760
some combination aggregate uh action
 

5669
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:06,669
some combination aggregate uh action
potential changes and then you can pick

5670
01:59:06,669 --> 01:59:06,679
potential changes and then you can pick
 

5671
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:09,950
potential changes and then you can pick
it up right it's a much slower um

5672
01:59:09,950 --> 01:59:09,960
it up right it's a much slower um
 

5673
01:59:09,960 --> 01:59:13,750
it up right it's a much slower um
changing uh signals but you know uh

5674
01:59:13,750 --> 01:59:13,760
changing uh signals but you know uh
 

5675
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:15,430
changing uh signals but you know uh
there there are these like canonical

5676
01:59:15,430 --> 01:59:15,440
there there are these like canonical
 

5677
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,030
there there are these like canonical
kind of oscillations and waves like

5678
01:59:17,030 --> 01:59:17,040
kind of oscillations and waves like
 

5679
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:18,669
kind of oscillations and waves like
gamma waves beta waves like when you

5680
01:59:18,669 --> 01:59:18,679
gamma waves beta waves like when you
 

5681
01:59:18,679 --> 01:59:21,229
gamma waves beta waves like when you
sleep that that can be detected cuz

5682
01:59:21,229 --> 01:59:21,239
sleep that that can be detected cuz
 

5683
01:59:21,239 --> 01:59:24,310
sleep that that can be detected cuz
there's sort of a syn ionized um kind of

5684
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:24,320
there's sort of a syn ionized um kind of
 

5685
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:27,550
there's sort of a syn ionized um kind of
global global effect of the brain that

5686
01:59:27,550 --> 01:59:27,560
global global effect of the brain that
 

5687
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:30,550
global global effect of the brain that
that you can detect um and I mean the

5688
01:59:30,550 --> 01:59:30,560
that you can detect um and I mean the
 

5689
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:33,030
that you can detect um and I mean the
physics of this go like I mean if we

5690
01:59:33,030 --> 01:59:33,040
physics of this go like I mean if we
 

5691
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:34,510
physics of this go like I mean if we
really want to go down that rabbit hole

5692
01:59:34,510 --> 01:59:34,520
really want to go down that rabbit hole
 

5693
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:36,910
really want to go down that rabbit hole
like there there's a lot that goes on in

5694
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:36,920
like there there's a lot that goes on in
 

5695
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:40,310
like there there's a lot that goes on in
terms of like why diffusion physics at

5696
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:40,320
terms of like why diffusion physics at
 

5697
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:41,830
terms of like why diffusion physics at
some point dominates when you're further

5698
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:41,840
some point dominates when you're further
 

5699
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:43,790
some point dominates when you're further
away from the source you know it it it's

5700
01:59:43,790 --> 01:59:43,800
away from the source you know it it it's
 

5701
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:46,390
away from the source you know it it it's
just a Charged medium um so similar to

5702
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:46,400
just a Charged medium um so similar to
 

5703
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:48,750
just a Charged medium um so similar to
how when you have electromagnetic waves

5704
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:48,760
how when you have electromagnetic waves
 

5705
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,750
how when you have electromagnetic waves
propagating in atmosphere or in in a

5706
01:59:50,750 --> 01:59:50,760
propagating in atmosphere or in in a
 

5707
01:59:50,760 --> 01:59:52,709
propagating in atmosphere or in in a
Charged medium like a plasma

5708
01:59:52,709 --> 01:59:52,719
Charged medium like a plasma
 

5709
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:54,229
Charged medium like a plasma
there's this weird shielding that

5710
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:54,239
there's this weird shielding that
 

5711
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,870
there's this weird shielding that
happens that actually um further

5712
01:59:56,870 --> 01:59:56,880
happens that actually um further
 

5713
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,310
happens that actually um further
attenuates the signal um as you move

5714
01:59:59,310 --> 01:59:59,320
attenuates the signal um as you move
 

5715
01:59:59,320 --> 02:00:02,350
attenuates the signal um as you move
away from it so yeah you see like if you

5716
02:00:02,350 --> 02:00:02,360
away from it so yeah you see like if you
 

5717
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:04,950
away from it so yeah you see like if you
do a really really deep dive on kind of

5718
02:00:04,950 --> 02:00:04,960
do a really really deep dive on kind of
 

5719
02:00:04,960 --> 02:00:07,310
do a really really deep dive on kind of
the signal attenuation over distance you

5720
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:07,320
the signal attenuation over distance you
 

5721
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:09,629
the signal attenuation over distance you
start to see kind of 1/ R square in the

5722
02:00:09,629 --> 02:00:09,639
start to see kind of 1/ R square in the
 

5723
02:00:09,639 --> 02:00:11,790
start to see kind of 1/ R square in the
beginning and then exponential drop off

5724
02:00:11,790 --> 02:00:11,800
beginning and then exponential drop off
 

5725
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:13,310
beginning and then exponential drop off
and that's the knee at which you know

5726
02:00:13,310 --> 02:00:13,320
and that's the knee at which you know
 

5727
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:16,030
and that's the knee at which you know
you go from electromagnet magnetism

5728
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:16,040
you go from electromagnet magnetism
 

5729
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:18,589
you go from electromagnet magnetism
dominating to diffusion physics

5730
02:00:18,589 --> 02:00:18,599
dominating to diffusion physics
 

5731
02:00:18,599 --> 02:00:20,510

5733
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,109
dominating but once again with the
electrodes

5734
02:00:22,109 --> 02:00:22,119
electrodes
 

5735
02:00:22,119 --> 02:00:24,510
electrodes
the the biophysics that you need to

5736
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:24,520
the the biophysics that you need to
 

5737
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:28,350
the the biophysics that you need to
understand is is um not as deep because

5738
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:28,360
understand is is um not as deep because
 

5739
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:29,430
understand is is um not as deep because
no matter where you're placing that

5740
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:29,440
no matter where you're placing that
 

5741
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,189
no matter where you're placing that
you're listening to a small crowd of

5742
02:00:31,189 --> 02:00:31,199
you're listening to a small crowd of
 

5743
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:33,430
you're listening to a small crowd of
local neurons correct yeah so once you

5744
02:00:33,430 --> 02:00:33,440
local neurons correct yeah so once you
 

5745
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:35,310
local neurons correct yeah so once you
penetrate the brain um you know you're

5746
02:00:35,310 --> 02:00:35,320
penetrate the brain um you know you're
 

5747
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:37,629
penetrate the brain um you know you're
in the arena so to speak and there's a

5748
02:00:37,629 --> 02:00:37,639
in the arena so to speak and there's a
 

5749
02:00:37,639 --> 02:00:40,109
in the arena so to speak and there's a
lot of neurons there many many of them

5750
02:00:40,109 --> 02:00:40,119
lot of neurons there many many of them
 

5751
02:00:40,119 --> 02:00:41,589
lot of neurons there many many of them
but then again there's like uh there's a

5752
02:00:41,589 --> 02:00:41,599
but then again there's like uh there's a
 

5753
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:42,990
but then again there's like uh there's a
whole field of Neuroscience that's

5754
02:00:42,990 --> 02:00:43,000
whole field of Neuroscience that's
 

5755
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,709
whole field of Neuroscience that's
studying like how the different

5756
02:00:45,709 --> 02:00:45,719
studying like how the different
 

5757
02:00:45,719 --> 02:00:47,870
studying like how the different
groupings the different sections of the

5758
02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:47,880
groupings the different sections of the
 

5759
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:49,589
groupings the different sections of the
seating in the arena what they usually

5760
02:00:49,589 --> 02:00:49,599
seating in the arena what they usually
 

5761
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:51,589
seating in the arena what they usually
are responsible for which is where the

5762
02:00:51,589 --> 02:00:51,599
are responsible for which is where the
 

5763
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:54,109
are responsible for which is where the
the Met probably falls apart cuz the the

5764
02:00:54,109 --> 02:00:54,119
the Met probably falls apart cuz the the
 

5765
02:00:54,119 --> 02:00:55,589
the Met probably falls apart cuz the the
seating is not that organized in an

5766
02:00:55,589 --> 02:00:55,599
seating is not that organized in an
 

5767
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:57,990
seating is not that organized in an
arena also most of them are silent they

5768
02:00:57,990 --> 02:00:58,000
arena also most of them are silent they
 

5769
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,350
arena also most of them are silent they
don't really do much um you know or or

5770
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:01,360
don't really do much um you know or or
 

5771
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:04,189
don't really do much um you know or or
they their activities are um you know

5772
02:01:04,189 --> 02:01:04,199
they their activities are um you know
 

5773
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:05,550
they their activities are um you know
you have to hit it with just the right

5774
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:05,560
you have to hit it with just the right
 

5775
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,830
you have to hit it with just the right
set of stimulus so they're usually quiet

5776
02:01:08,830 --> 02:01:08,840
set of stimulus so they're usually quiet
 

5777
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:10,830
set of stimulus so they're usually quiet
they're usually very quiet quiet there's

5778
02:01:10,830 --> 02:01:10,840
they're usually very quiet quiet there's
 

5779
02:01:10,840 --> 02:01:12,870
they're usually very quiet quiet there's
I mean similar to dark energy and dark

5780
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:12,880
I mean similar to dark energy and dark
 

5781
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:15,270
I mean similar to dark energy and dark
matter there's dark neurons what are

5782
02:01:15,270 --> 02:01:15,280
matter there's dark neurons what are
 

5783
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,189
matter there's dark neurons what are
they all doing when you place these

5784
02:01:17,189 --> 02:01:17,199
they all doing when you place these
 

5785
02:01:17,199 --> 02:01:19,270
they all doing when you place these
electrode again like within this 100

5786
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:19,280
electrode again like within this 100
 

5787
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:21,709

Micron volume you have 40 or so neurons

5788
02:01:21,709 --> 02:01:21,719
Micron volume you have 40 or so neurons
 

5789
02:01:21,719 --> 02:01:23,510
Micron volume you have 40 or so neurons
like why why do you not see 40 neurons

5790
02:01:23,510 --> 02:01:23,520
like why why do you not see 40 neurons
 

5791
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:25,069
like why why do you not see 40 neurons
why do you see only a handful what is

5792
02:01:25,069 --> 02:01:25,079
why do you see only a handful what is
 

5793
02:01:25,079 --> 02:01:26,510
why do you see only a handful what is
happening there well they're mostly

5794
02:01:26,510 --> 02:01:26,520
happening there well they're mostly
 

5795
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,510
happening there well they're mostly
quiet but like when they speak they say

5796
02:01:28,510 --> 02:01:28,520
quiet but like when they speak they say
 

5797
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,629
quiet but like when they speak they say
profound I think that's the way I'd

5798
02:01:30,629 --> 02:01:30,639
profound I think that's the way I'd
 

5799
02:01:30,639 --> 02:01:32,950
profound I think that's the way I'd
like to think about it anyway before we

5800
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:32,960
like to think about it anyway before we
 

5801
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,790
like to think about it anyway before we
zoom in even more let's zoom out so how

5802
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:36,800
zoom in even more let's zoom out so how
 

5803
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:39,830
zoom in even more let's zoom out so how
does neuralink work

5804

everything involved but on the technical
 

5837
02:02:23,719 --> 02:02:26,350
everything involved but on the technical
level how does neuralink work yeah so

5838
02:02:26,350 --> 02:02:26,360
level how does neuralink work yeah so
 

5839
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:28,189
level how does neuralink work yeah so
there are three major components to the

5840
02:02:28,189 --> 02:02:28,199
there are three major components to the
 

5841
02:02:28,199 --> 02:02:30,430
there are three major components to the
technology that we're building uh one is

5842
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:30,440
technology that we're building uh one is
 

5843
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:32,830
technology that we're building uh one is
the device um the thing that's actually

5844
02:02:32,830 --> 02:02:32,840
the device um the thing that's actually
 

5845
02:02:32,840 --> 02:02:36,189
the device um the thing that's actually
recording these neural Chatters uh we

5846
02:02:36,189 --> 02:02:36,199
recording these neural Chatters uh we
 

5847
02:02:36,199 --> 02:02:37,350
recording these neural Chatters uh we
call it

5848
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:37,360
call it
 

5849
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:41,149
call it
N1 implant or the link

5850
02:02:41,149 --> 02:02:41,159
N1 implant or the link
 

5851
02:02:41,159 --> 02:02:43,629
N1 implant or the link
and uh we have a surgical robot that's

5852
02:02:43,629 --> 02:02:43,639
and uh we have a surgical robot that's
 

5853
02:02:43,639 --> 02:02:46,390
and uh we have a surgical robot that's
actually doing an implantation of these

5854
02:02:46,390 --> 02:02:46,400
actually doing an implantation of these
 

5855
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,149
actually doing an implantation of these
tiny tiny wires that we call threads

5856
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:48,159
tiny tiny wires that we call threads
 

5857
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:50,629
tiny tiny wires that we call threads
that are you know smaller than uh human

5858
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:50,639
that are you know smaller than uh human
 

5859
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:53,030
that are you know smaller than uh human
hair and um

5860
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,040
hair and um
 

5861
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:55,830
hair and um
once everything is surged you have these

5862
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:55,840
once everything is surged you have these
 

5863
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:58,229
once everything is surged you have these
neural signals these spiking neurons

5864
02:02:58,229 --> 02:02:58,239
neural signals these spiking neurons
 

5865
02:02:58,239 --> 02:03:00,910
neural signals these spiking neurons
that are coming out of the brain and uh

5866
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:00,920
that are coming out of the brain and uh
 

5867
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,350
that are coming out of the brain and uh
you need to have some sort of software

5868
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:02,360
you need to have some sort of software
 

5869
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:06,229
you need to have some sort of software
to decode what the users intend to do

5870
02:03:06,229 --> 02:03:06,239
to decode what the users intend to do
 

5871
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:08,790
to decode what the users intend to do
with that um so there's What's called

5872
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:08,800
with that um so there's What's called
 

5873
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:11,350
with that um so there's What's called
the neuralink application or B1 app

5874
02:03:11,350 --> 02:03:11,360
the neuralink application or B1 app
 

5875
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:13,310
the neuralink application or B1 app
that's doing that translation is running

5876
02:03:13,310 --> 02:03:13,320
that's doing that translation is running
 

5877
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:16,390
that's doing that translation is running
the very very simple machine learning

the very very simple machine learning
model that decodes these um inputs that

5880
02:03:20,550 --> 02:03:20,560
model that decodes these um inputs that
 

5881
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,910
model that decodes these um inputs that
are neural signals and then convert it

5882
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:22,920
are neural signals and then convert it
 

5883
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:25,870
are neural signals and then convert it
to a set of outputs that allows um you

5884
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:25,880
to a set of outputs that allows um you
 

5885
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:27,550
to a set of outputs that allows um you
know our participant uh first

5886
02:03:27,550 --> 02:03:27,560
know our participant uh first
 

5887
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:29,870

02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:45,760
or not send that through Bluetooth to an
 

5941
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:47,669
or not send that through Bluetooth to an
external device whether it's a a phone

5942
02:04:47,669 --> 02:04:47,679
external device whether it's a a phone
 

5943
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:49,189
external device whether it's a a phone
or a computer that's running this

5944
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:49,199
or a computer that's running this
 

5945
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:51,069
or a computer that's running this
neuralink application so there's onboard

5946
02:04:51,069 --> 02:04:51,079
neuralink application so there's onboard
 

5947
02:04:51,079 --> 02:04:53,109
neuralink application so there's onboard
signal process in already just to decide

5948
02:04:53,109 --> 02:04:53,119
signal process in already just to decide
 

5949
02:04:53,119 --> 02:04:54,589
signal process in already just to decide
whether this is an interesting event or

5950
02:04:54,589 --> 02:04:54,599
whether this is an interesting event or
 

5951
02:04:54,599 --> 02:04:56,589
whether this is an interesting event or
not so there is some computational power

5952
02:04:56,589 --> 02:04:56,599
not so there is some computational power
 

5953
02:04:56,599 --> 02:04:59,069
not so there is some computational power
on board inside the in addition to the

5954
02:04:59,069 --> 02:04:59,079
on board inside the in addition to the
 

5955
02:04:59,079 --> 02:05:01,629
on board inside the in addition to the
human frame yeah so it does the signal

5956
02:05:01,629 --> 02:05:01,639
human frame yeah so it does the signal
 

5957
02:05:01,639 --> 02:05:03,950
human frame yeah so it does the signal
processing to kind of really compress

5958
02:05:03,950 --> 02:05:03,960
processing to kind of really compress
 

5959
02:05:03,960 --> 02:05:05,430
processing to kind of really compress
the amount of signal that you you're

5960
02:05:05,430 --> 02:05:05,440
the amount of signal that you you're
 

5961
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:08,310
the amount of signal that you you're
recording so we have a total of thousand

5962
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:08,320
recording so we have a total of thousand
 

5963
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:11,470
recording so we have a total of thousand
electrodes um sampling at uh you know

5964
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:11,480
electrodes um sampling at uh you know
 

5965
02:05:11,480 --> 02:05:14,870
electrodes um sampling at uh you know
just under 20 khz with 10 bit each so

5966
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:14,880
just under 20 khz with 10 bit each so
 

5967
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,629
just under 20 khz with 10 bit each so
wow uh that's 200 megabits um that's

5968
02:05:18,629 --> 02:05:18,639
wow uh that's 200 megabits um that's
 

5969
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:21,109
wow uh that's 200 megabits um that's
coming through to the chip uh from

5970
02:05:21,109 --> 02:05:21,119
coming through to the chip uh from
 

5971
02:05:21,119 --> 02:05:23,870
coming through to the chip uh from
thousand uh Channel simultaneous uh

5972
02:05:23,870 --> 02:05:23,880
thousand uh Channel simultaneous uh
 

5973
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:27,229
thousand uh Channel simultaneous uh
neural recording and that's quite a bit

5974
02:05:27,229 --> 02:05:27,239
neural recording and that's quite a bit
 

5975
02:05:27,239 --> 02:05:28,990
neural recording and that's quite a bit
of data and you know there is there are

5976
02:05:28,990 --> 02:05:29,000
of data and you know there is there are
 

5977
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,030
of data and you know there is there are
technology available to send that off

5978
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:31,040
technology available to send that off
 

5979
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,189

environment that is a brain so there has

5984
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:38,480
environment that is a brain so there has
 

5985
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:40,709
environment that is a brain so there has
to be some amount of compression that

5986
02:05:40,709 --> 02:05:40,719
to be some amount of compression that
 

5987
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:43,229
to be some amount of compression that
happens to send off only the interesting

so the implant itself processes it

6000
02:06:00,629 --> 02:06:00,639
so the implant itself processes it
 

6001
02:06:00,639 --> 02:06:02,669
so the implant itself processes it
figures out whether a spike happened or

6002
02:06:02,669 --> 02:06:02,679

and then sends it off packages it send

6006
02:06:08,109 --> 02:06:08,119
and then sends it off packages it send
 

6007
02:06:08,119 --> 02:06:11,310
and then sends it off packages it send
it off through Bluetooth um to an

the brain uh so I'm looking at a picture

6024
02:06:30,350 --> 02:06:30,360
the brain uh so I'm looking at a picture
 

6025
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:32,030
the brain uh so I'm looking at a picture
of it there's an

02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:32,040
of it there's an
 

6027
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:34,310
of it there's an
enclosure uh there's a charging coil so

6028
02:06:34,310 --> 02:06:34,320
enclosure uh there's a charging coil so
 

6029
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,709
enclosure uh there's a charging coil so
we didn't talk about the charging which

6030
02:06:36,709 --> 02:06:36,719
we didn't talk about the charging which
 

6031
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:38,030
we didn't talk about the charging which
is

6032
02:06:38,030 --> 02:06:38,040
is
 

6033
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:40,990
is
fascinating uh the the battery the Power

6034
02:06:40,990 --> 02:06:41,000
fascinating uh the the battery the Power
 

6035
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,390
fascinating uh the the battery the Power
Electronics the

Electronics the
 

6037
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,549
Electronics the
antenna uh then there's the signal

6038
02:06:44,549 --> 02:06:44,559

Electronics I wonder if there's more

6042
02:06:47,549 --> 02:06:47,559
Electronics I wonder if there's more
 

6043
02:06:47,559 --> 02:06:49,149
Electronics I wonder if there's more
kinds of signal processing you can do

6044
02:06:49,149 --> 02:06:49,159
kinds of signal processing you can do
 

6045
02:06:49,159 --> 02:06:50,510
kinds of signal processing you can do
that's that's another that's another

6046
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:50,520
that's that's another that's another
 

6047
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:53,149
that's that's another that's another
question and then there's the threads

6048
02:06:53,149 --> 02:06:53,159
question and then there's the threads
 

6049
02:06:53,159 --> 02:06:55,830
question and then there's the threads
themselves with the enclosure on the

6050
02:06:55,830 --> 02:06:55,840
themselves with the enclosure on the
 

6051
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:59,669
themselves with the enclosure on the
bottom so maybe to ask about the

6052
02:06:59,669 --> 02:06:59,679
bottom so maybe to ask about the
 

6053
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:02,310
bottom so maybe to ask about the
charging so there's a external charging

6054
02:07:02,310 --> 02:07:02,320
charging so there's a external charging
 

6055
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,229
charging so there's a external charging
device mhm yeah there's an external

6056
02:07:04,229 --> 02:07:04,239
device mhm yeah there's an external
 

6057
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:06,109
device mhm yeah there's an external
charging device um so yeah the the

02:07:06,109 --> 02:07:06,119
charging device um so yeah the the
 

6059
02:07:06,119 --> 02:07:08,030
charging device um so yeah the the
second part of the implant the threads

6060
02:07:08,030 --> 02:07:08,040
second part of the implant the threads
 

6061
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:11,430
second part of the implant the threads
are the ones again just the the last 3

are the ones again just the the last 3
 

6063
02:07:11,440 --> 02:07:13,310
are the ones again just the the last 3
to 5 millim are the ones that are

6064
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:13,320
to 5 millim are the ones that are
 

6065
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:16,430
to 5 millim are the ones that are
actually penetrating the cortex uh rest

6066
02:07:16,430 --> 02:07:16,440
actually penetrating the cortex uh rest
 

6067
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:19,310
actually penetrating the cortex uh rest
of it is actually most of the volume is

6068
02:07:19,310 --> 02:07:19,320
of it is actually most of the volume is
 

6069
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:22,109
of it is actually most of the volume is
occupied by the battery uh rechargeable

6070
02:07:22,109 --> 02:07:22,119
occupied by the battery uh rechargeable
 

6071
02:07:22,119 --> 02:07:25,310
occupied by the battery uh rechargeable
battery um and uh you know it's about a

6072
02:07:25,310 --> 02:07:25,320
battery um and uh you know it's about a
 

6073
02:07:25,320 --> 02:07:26,870
battery um and uh you know it's about a
size of a quarter uh you know I actually

6074
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:26,880
size of a quarter uh you know I actually
 

6075
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:28,549
size of a quarter uh you know I actually
have a device here if you want to take a

6076
02:07:28,549 --> 02:07:28,559
have a device here if you want to take a
 

6077
02:07:28,559 --> 02:07:29,390
have a device here if you want to take a
look at

6078
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:29,400
look at
 

6079
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,069
look at
it

6080
02:07:31,069 --> 02:07:31,079
it
 

6081
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:33,910
it
um you know this is the the flexible

6082
02:07:33,910 --> 02:07:33,920
um you know this is the the flexible
 

6083
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:35,750
um you know this is the the flexible
thread component of it and then this is

6084
02:07:35,750 --> 02:07:35,760
thread component of it and then this is
 

6085
02:07:35,760 --> 02:07:37,830
thread component of it and then this is
the

6086
02:07:37,830 --> 02:07:37,840
the
 

6087
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:40,109
the
implant so it's about a size of a US

6088
02:07:40,109 --> 02:07:40,119
implant so it's about a size of a US
 

6089
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:43,830
implant so it's about a size of a US
Quarter um it's about 9 mm thick so

6090
02:07:43,830 --> 02:07:43,840
Quarter um it's about 9 mm thick so
 

6091
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:45,870
Quarter um it's about 9 mm thick so
basically this implant uh you know once

6092
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:45,880
basically this implant uh you know once
 

6093
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:48,390
basically this implant uh you know once
you have the craniectomy and the and the

6094
02:07:48,390 --> 02:07:48,400
you have the craniectomy and the and the
 

6095
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:52,830
you have the craniectomy and the and the
diromy um threads are inserted and and

6096
02:07:52,830 --> 02:07:52,840
diromy um threads are inserted and and
 

6097
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:54,990
diromy um threads are inserted and and
um the the hole that you created this

6098
02:07:54,990 --> 02:07:55,000
um the the hole that you created this
 

6099
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,350
um the the hole that you created this
craniectomy gets replaced with that so

6100
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:57,360
craniectomy gets replaced with that so
 

6101
02:07:57,360 --> 02:07:59,910
craniectomy gets replaced with that so
basically that thing plugs that hole and

6102
02:07:59,910 --> 02:07:59,920
basically that thing plugs that hole and
 

6103
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,310
basically that thing plugs that hole and
you can screw in uh these self- drilling

6104
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:03,320
you can screw in uh these self- drilling
 

6105
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:08,069
you can screw in uh these self- drilling
cranial screws to hold it in place and

6106
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:08,079
cranial screws to hold it in place and
 

6107
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:09,350
cranial screws to hold it in place and
at the end of the day once you have the

6108
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
at the end of the day once you have the
 

6109
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:12,229
at the end of the day once you have the
skin flap over uh there's only about 2

6110
02:08:12,229 --> 02:08:12,239
skin flap over uh there's only about 2
 

6111
02:08:12,239 --> 02:08:14,990
skin flap over uh there's only about 2
to 3 mm that's you know obviously

6112
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:15,000
to 3 mm that's you know obviously
 

6113
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,069
to 3 mm that's you know obviously
transitioning off of the top of the

6114
02:08:17,069 --> 02:08:17,079
transitioning off of the top of the
 

6115
02:08:17,079 --> 02:08:19,950
transitioning off of the top of the
implant to where the screws are and and

6116
02:08:19,950 --> 02:08:19,960
implant to where the screws are and and
 

6117
02:08:19,960 --> 02:08:22,430
implant to where the screws are and and
that's the minor bump that you have

6118
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:22,440
that's the minor bump that you have
 

6119
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:24,950
that's the minor bump that you have
those threads look

6120
02:08:24,950 --> 02:08:24,960
those threads look
 

6121
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:28,470
those threads look
tiny that's incredible that is really

6122
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:28,480
tiny that's incredible that is really
 

6123
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:31,270
tiny that's incredible that is really
incredible that is really incredible and

6124
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:31,280
incredible that is really incredible and
 

6125
02:08:31,280 --> 02:08:33,669
incredible that is really incredible and
also as you're right most of the volume

6126
02:08:33,669 --> 02:08:33,679
also as you're right most of the volume
 

6127
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:36,149
also as you're right most of the volume
actual volume is the battery yeah wow

6128
02:08:36,149 --> 02:08:36,159
actual volume is the battery yeah wow
 

6129
02:08:36,159 --> 02:08:38,510
actual volume is the battery yeah wow
this is way smaller than I realized they

6130
02:08:38,510 --> 02:08:38,520
this is way smaller than I realized they
 

6131
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,310
this is way smaller than I realized they
they are also the threads themselves are

6132
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:40,320
they are also the threads themselves are
 

6133
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:43,109
they are also the threads themselves are
quite strong they look strong and and

6134
02:08:43,109 --> 02:08:43,119
quite strong they look strong and and
 

6135
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:45,430
quite strong they look strong and and
the thread themselves also has a very

6136
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:45,440
the thread themselves also has a very
 

6137
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:48,069
the thread themselves also has a very
interesting um feature at the end of it

6138
02:08:48,069 --> 02:08:48,079
interesting um feature at the end of it
 

6139
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:50,430
interesting um feature at the end of it
called The Loop and that's the mechanism

6140
02:08:50,430 --> 02:08:50,440
called The Loop and that's the mechanism
 

6141
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,350
called The Loop and that's the mechanism
to which the robot is able to interface

6142
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:52,360
to which the robot is able to interface
 

6143
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:54,910
to which the robot is able to interface
and manipulate this tiny hairlike

6144
02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:54,920
and manipulate this tiny hairlike
 

6145
02:08:54,920 --> 02:08:56,910
and manipulate this tiny hairlike
structure and they're tiny so what's the

6146
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:56,920
structure and they're tiny so what's the
 

6147
02:08:56,920 --> 02:08:59,790
structure and they're tiny so what's the
width of a thread yeah so the the width

6148
02:08:59,790 --> 02:08:59,800
width of a thread yeah so the the width
 

6149
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:03,790
width of a thread yeah so the the width
of a thread um starts from 16 Micron and

6150
02:09:03,790 --> 02:09:03,800
of a thread um starts from 16 Micron and
 

6151
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:07,589
of a thread um starts from 16 Micron and
then tapers out to about 84 Micron so

6152
02:09:07,589 --> 02:09:07,599
then tapers out to about 84 Micron so
 

6153
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:09,350
then tapers out to about 84 Micron so
you know average human hair is about

6154
02:09:09,350 --> 02:09:09,360
you know average human hair is about
 

6155
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:12,470
you know average human hair is about
8200 Micron in

6156
02:09:12,470 --> 02:09:12,480
8200 Micron in
 

6157
02:09:12,480 --> 02:09:15,030
8200 Micron in
width this thing is amazing this thing

6158
02:09:15,030 --> 02:09:15,040
width this thing is amazing this thing
 

6159
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:15,790
width this thing is amazing this thing
is

6160
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:15,800
is
 

6161
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:18,350
is
amazing yeah so most of the volume is

6162
02:09:18,350 --> 02:09:18,360
amazing yeah so most of the volume is
 

6163
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:20,510
amazing yeah so most of the volume is
occupied by the by the battery

6164
02:09:20,510 --> 02:09:20,520
occupied by the by the battery
 

6165
02:09:20,520 --> 02:09:25,629
occupied by the by the battery
rechargeable Li iion cell um and uh the

6166
02:09:25,629 --> 02:09:25,639
rechargeable Li iion cell um and uh the
 

6167
02:09:25,639 --> 02:09:28,030
rechargeable Li iion cell um and uh the
charging is done through inductive

6168
02:09:28,030 --> 02:09:28,040
charging is done through inductive
 

6169
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:29,950
charging is done through inductive
charging which is actually very commonly

6170
02:09:29,950 --> 02:09:29,960
charging which is actually very commonly
 

6171
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:31,470
charging which is actually very commonly
used you know your cell phone most cell

6172
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:31,480
used you know your cell phone most cell
 

6173
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:34,510
used you know your cell phone most cell
phones have that um the biggest

6174
02:09:34,510 --> 02:09:34,520
phones have that um the biggest
 

6175
02:09:34,520 --> 02:09:36,549
phones have that um the biggest
difference is that you know for

6176
02:09:36,549 --> 02:09:36,559
difference is that you know for
 

6177
02:09:36,559 --> 02:09:38,709
difference is that you know for
us you know usually when you have a

6178
02:09:38,709 --> 02:09:38,719
us you know usually when you have a
 

6179
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:40,149
us you know usually when you have a
phone and you want to charge it on a

6180
02:09:40,149 --> 02:09:40,159
phone and you want to charge it on a
 

6181
02:09:40,159 --> 02:09:41,830
phone and you want to charge it on a
charging pad you don't really care how

6182
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:41,840
charging pad you don't really care how
 

6183
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:44,589
charging pad you don't really care how
hot it gets whereas for us it matters

6184
02:09:44,589 --> 02:09:44,599
hot it gets whereas for us it matters
 

6185
02:09:44,599 --> 02:09:46,510
hot it gets whereas for us it matters
there's a very strict regulation and

6186
02:09:46,510 --> 02:09:46,520
there's a very strict regulation and
 

6187
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,589
there's a very strict regulation and
good reasons to not actually increase

6188
02:09:48,589 --> 02:09:48,599
good reasons to not actually increase
 

6189
02:09:48,599 --> 02:09:50,310
good reasons to not actually increase
the surrounding tissue temperature by

6190
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:50,320
the surrounding tissue temperature by
 

6191
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:53,350
the surrounding tissue temperature by
two degrees Celsius so there's actually

6192
02:09:53,350 --> 02:09:53,360
two degrees Celsius so there's actually
 

6193
02:09:53,360 --> 02:09:56,350
two degrees Celsius so there's actually
a lot of innovation that is packed into

6194
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:56,360
a lot of innovation that is packed into
 

6195
02:09:56,360 --> 02:10:00,709
a lot of innovation that is packed into
this to allow charging of this implant

6196
02:10:00,709 --> 02:10:00,719
this to allow charging of this implant
 

6197
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:02,470
this to allow charging of this implant
without causing that temperature

6198
02:10:02,470 --> 02:10:02,480
without causing that temperature
 

6199
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:05,229
without causing that temperature
threshold to reach and even small things

6200
02:10:05,229 --> 02:10:05,239
threshold to reach and even small things
 

6201
02:10:05,239 --> 02:10:07,229
threshold to reach and even small things
like you see this charging coil and

6202
02:10:07,229 --> 02:10:07,239
like you see this charging coil and
 

6203
02:10:07,239 --> 02:10:10,470
like you see this charging coil and
what's called The farite Shield right so

6204
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:10,480
what's called The farite Shield right so
 

6205
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:12,270
what's called The farite Shield right so
uh without that fite Shield what you end

6206
02:10:12,270 --> 02:10:12,280
uh without that fite Shield what you end
 

6207
02:10:12,280 --> 02:10:13,910
uh without that fite Shield what you end
up having when you have um you know

6208
02:10:13,910 --> 02:10:13,920
up having when you have um you know
 

6209
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:16,669
up having when you have um you know
resonant inductive charging is that the

6210
02:10:16,669 --> 02:10:16,679
resonant inductive charging is that the
 

6211
02:10:16,679 --> 02:10:19,990
resonant inductive charging is that the
battery itself is a metallic can and you

6212
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:20,000
battery itself is a metallic can and you
 

6213
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,069
battery itself is a metallic can and you
form these Ed currents

6214
02:10:22,069 --> 02:10:22,079
form these Ed currents
 

6215
02:10:22,079 --> 02:10:25,109
form these Ed currents
um from uh external charger and that

6216
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:25,119
um from uh external charger and that
 

6217
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:28,669
um from uh external charger and that
causes heating um and that actually

6218
02:10:28,669 --> 02:10:28,679
causes heating um and that actually
 

6219
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:31,629
causes heating um and that actually
contributes to inefficiency in charging

6220
02:10:31,629 --> 02:10:31,639
contributes to inefficiency in charging
 

6221
02:10:31,639 --> 02:10:34,390
contributes to inefficiency in charging
um so this ferite Shield what it does is

6222
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:34,400
um so this ferite Shield what it does is
 

6223
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,549
um so this ferite Shield what it does is
that it actually

6224
02:10:36,549 --> 02:10:36,559
that it actually
 

6225
02:10:36,559 --> 02:10:39,390
that it actually
concentrate that field line away from

6226
02:10:39,390 --> 02:10:39,400
concentrate that field line away from
 

6227
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,390
concentrate that field line away from
the battery and then around the coil

6228
02:10:41,390 --> 02:10:41,400
the battery and then around the coil
 

6229
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:42,870
the battery and then around the coil
that's actually wrapped around it

6230
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:42,880
that's actually wrapped around it
 

6231
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,549
that's actually wrapped around it
there's a lot of really fascinating

6232
02:10:44,549 --> 02:10:44,559
there's a lot of really fascinating
 

6233
02:10:44,559 --> 02:10:48,069
there's a lot of really fascinating
design here to to make it I mean you're

6234
02:10:48,069 --> 02:10:48,079
design here to to make it I mean you're
 

6235
02:10:48,079 --> 02:10:51,350
design here to to make it I mean you're
integrating a computer into a biological

6236
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:51,360
integrating a computer into a biological
 

6237
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,390
integrating a computer into a biological
complex biological system yeah there's a

6238
02:10:53,390 --> 02:10:53,400
complex biological system yeah there's a
 

6239
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,390
complex biological system yeah there's a
lot of innovation here I would say that

6240
02:10:55,390 --> 02:10:55,400
lot of innovation here I would say that
 

6241
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:59,310
lot of innovation here I would say that
part of what enabled this was just the

6242
02:10:59,310 --> 02:10:59,320
part of what enabled this was just the
 

6243
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:01,669
part of what enabled this was just the
Innovations in the wearable uh there's a

6244
02:11:01,669 --> 02:11:01,679
Innovations in the wearable uh there's a
 

6245
02:11:01,679 --> 02:11:05,910
Innovations in the wearable uh there's a
lot of really really powerful tiny low

6246
02:11:05,910 --> 02:11:05,920
lot of really really powerful tiny low
 

6247
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:07,870
lot of really really powerful tiny low
power uh

6248
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:07,880
power uh
 

6249
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:10,189
power uh
microcontrollers temperature sensors or

6250
02:11:10,189 --> 02:11:10,199
microcontrollers temperature sensors or
 

6251
02:11:10,199 --> 02:11:12,990

Electronics a lot of innovation really

6254
02:11:15,030 --> 02:11:15,040
Electronics a lot of innovation really
 

6255
02:11:15,040 --> 02:11:17,830
Electronics a lot of innovation really
came in the the charging coil design how

6256
02:11:17,830 --> 02:11:17,840
came in the the charging coil design how
 

6257
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:20,709
came in the the charging coil design how
this is packaged and how do you enable

6258
02:11:20,709 --> 02:11:20,719
this is packaged and how do you enable
 

6259
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:23,589
this is packaged and how do you enable
charging such that you don't really uh

6260
02:11:23,589 --> 02:11:23,599
charging such that you don't really uh
 

6261
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:25,030
charging such that you don't really uh
exceed that temperature limit which is

6262
02:11:25,030 --> 02:11:25,040
exceed that temperature limit which is
 

6263
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:27,149
exceed that temperature limit which is
not a constraint for other devices out

6264
02:11:27,149 --> 02:11:27,159
not a constraint for other devices out
 

6265
02:11:27,159 --> 02:11:29,350
not a constraint for other devices out
there so let's talk about the threads

6266
02:11:29,350 --> 02:11:29,360
there so let's talk about the threads
 

6267
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:31,870
there so let's talk about the threads
themselves those tiny tiny tiny things

6268
02:11:31,870 --> 02:11:31,880
themselves those tiny tiny tiny things
 

6269
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:34,750
themselves those tiny tiny tiny things
so uh how many of them are there you

6270
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:34,760
so uh how many of them are there you
 

6271
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:37,589
so uh how many of them are there you
mentioned a th000 electrodes how many

6272
02:11:37,589 --> 02:11:37,599
mentioned a th000 electrodes how many
 

6273
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:40,069
mentioned a th000 electrodes how many
threads are there and what do the

6274
02:11:40,069 --> 02:11:40,079
threads are there and what do the
 

6275
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:41,950
threads are there and what do the
electrodes have to do with the threads

6276
02:11:41,950 --> 02:11:41,960
electrodes have to do with the threads
 

6277
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:44,950
electrodes have to do with the threads
yeah so the current instantiation of the

6278
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:44,960
yeah so the current instantiation of the
 

6279
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:48,510
yeah so the current instantiation of the
device has 64 threads and each thread

it with naked

6314
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:41,040
it with naked
 

6315
02:12:41,040 --> 02:12:43,990
it with naked
eyes and I I mean to State the obvious

6316
02:12:43,990 --> 02:12:44,000
eyes and I I mean to State the obvious
 

6317
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,189
eyes and I I mean to State the obvious
or maybe for people who are just

6318
02:12:45,189 --> 02:12:45,199
or maybe for people who are just
 

6319
02:12:45,199 --> 02:12:46,750
or maybe for people who are just
listening they're

6320
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:46,760
listening they're
 

6321
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:49,950
listening they're
flexible yes yes that's also one element

6322
02:12:49,950 --> 02:12:49,960
flexible yes yes that's also one element
 

6323
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:52,589
flexible yes yes that's also one element
that uh was incredibly important for us

6324
02:12:52,589 --> 02:12:52,599
that uh was incredibly important for us
 

6325
02:12:52,599 --> 02:12:55,549
that uh was incredibly important for us
um so each of these thread are as I

6326
02:12:55,549 --> 02:12:55,559
um so each of these thread are as I
 

6327
02:12:55,559 --> 02:12:57,870
um so each of these thread are as I
mentioned 16 Micron in width and then

6328
02:12:57,870 --> 02:12:57,880
mentioned 16 Micron in width and then
 

6329
02:12:57,880 --> 02:13:00,589
mentioned 16 Micron in width and then
they taper to 84 Micron but in thickness

6330
02:13:00,589 --> 02:13:00,599
they taper to 84 Micron but in thickness
 

6331
02:13:00,599 --> 02:13:05,310
they taper to 84 Micron but in thickness
they're less than 5 Micron MH um and in

6332
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:05,320
they're less than 5 Micron MH um and in
 

6333
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:07,189
they're less than 5 Micron MH um and in
thickness it's mostly you know a poly

6334
02:13:07,189 --> 02:13:07,199
thickness it's mostly you know a poly
 

6335
02:13:07,199 --> 02:13:10,390
thickness it's mostly you know a poly

that is uh 37° C bag of salt water so

6348
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:26,000
that is uh 37° C bag of salt water so
 

6349
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:27,910
that is uh 37° C bag of salt water so
what what's some maybe can you speak to

6350
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:27,920
what what's some maybe can you speak to
 

6351
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,549
what what's some maybe can you speak to
some interesting aspects of the material

6352
02:13:30,549 --> 02:13:30,559
some interesting aspects of the material
 

6353
02:13:30,559 --> 02:13:33,310
some interesting aspects of the material
design here like what does it take to to

6354
02:13:33,310 --> 02:13:33,320
design here like what does it take to to
 

6355
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:35,109
design here like what does it take to to
design a thing like this and to be able

6356
02:13:35,109 --> 02:13:35,119
design a thing like this and to be able
 

6357
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:37,790
design a thing like this and to be able
to manufacture a thing like this uh for

6358
02:13:37,790 --> 02:13:37,800
to manufacture a thing like this uh for
 

6359
02:13:37,800 --> 02:13:39,709

6361
02:13:39,719 --> 02:13:41,709
people who don't know anything about
this kind of thing yeah so the material

6362
02:13:41,709 --> 02:13:41,719
this kind of thing yeah so the material
 

6363
02:13:41,719 --> 02:13:44,109
this kind of thing yeah so the material
selection that we have is not I don't

6364
02:13:44,109 --> 02:13:44,119
selection that we have is not I don't
 

6365
02:13:44,119 --> 02:13:47,270
selection that we have is not I don't
think it was particularly unique um

6366
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:47,280
think it was particularly unique um
 

6367
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:49,910
think it was particularly unique um
there there were other labs and there

6368

are other labs that are kind of looking
 

6371
02:13:51,599 --> 02:13:55,790
are other labs that are kind of looking
at similar um material stack um there's

6372
02:13:55,790 --> 02:13:55,800
at similar um material stack um there's
 

6373
02:13:55,800 --> 02:13:58,149
at similar um material stack um there's
kind of a fundamental question um and

6374
02:13:58,149 --> 02:13:58,159
kind of a fundamental question um and
 

6375
02:13:58,159 --> 02:14:00,870
kind of a fundamental question um and
and still needs to be answered around

6376
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:00,880
and still needs to be answered around
 

6377
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:03,189
and still needs to be answered around
the longevity and reliability of these

6378
02:14:03,189 --> 02:14:03,199
the longevity and reliability of these
 

6379
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:06,069

02:14:35,159 --> 02:14:37,750
Utah R because you know he was at
University of Utah and what is the Utah

6406
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:37,760
University of Utah and what is the Utah
 

6407
02:14:37,760 --> 02:14:41,109
University of Utah and what is the Utah
R look like so it's a rigid type of yeah

6408
02:14:41,109 --> 02:14:41,119
R look like so it's a rigid type of yeah
 

6409
02:14:41,119 --> 02:14:44,910
R look like so it's a rigid type of yeah
so we can actually look it

6410
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:44,920

 

6411
02:14:44,920 --> 02:14:47,270

up

6412
02:14:47,270 --> 02:14:47,280
up
 

6413
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:50,149
up
yeah yeah so it's a bed of needle um

6414
02:14:50,149 --> 02:14:50,159
yeah yeah so it's a bed of needle um
 

6415
02:14:50,159 --> 02:14:51,950
yeah yeah so it's a bed of needle um
there's

6416
02:14:51,950 --> 02:14:51,960
there's
 

6417
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:54,709
there's
yeah okay go ahead I'm sorry those are r

6418
02:14:54,709 --> 02:14:54,719
yeah okay go ahead I'm sorry those are r
 

6419
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,350
yeah okay go ahead I'm sorry those are r
r shank yeah you weren't kiding and the

6420
02:14:57,350 --> 02:14:57,360
r shank yeah you weren't kiding and the
 

6421
02:14:57,360 --> 02:14:59,270
r shank yeah you weren't kiding and the
size and the number of Shanks vary

6422
02:14:59,270 --> 02:14:59,280
size and the number of Shanks vary
 

6423
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:04,229
size and the number of Shanks vary
anywhere from 64 to 128 um at the very

6424
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:04,239
anywhere from 64 to 128 um at the very
 

6425
02:15:04,239 --> 02:15:05,950
anywhere from 64 to 128 um at the very
tip of it is an exposed electrode that

6426
02:15:05,950 --> 02:15:05,960
tip of it is an exposed electrode that
 

6427
02:15:05,960 --> 02:15:07,950
tip of it is an exposed electrode that
actually records neural signal um the

6428
02:15:07,950 --> 02:15:07,960
actually records neural signal um the
 

6429
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:09,510
actually records neural signal um the
other thing that's interesting to note

6430
02:15:09,510 --> 02:15:09,520
other thing that's interesting to note
 

6431
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:12,109
other thing that's interesting to note
is that uh unlike neuralink threads that

6432
02:15:12,109 --> 02:15:12,119
is that uh unlike neuralink threads that
 

6433
02:15:12,119 --> 02:15:14,390
is that uh unlike neuralink threads that
have recording electrodes that are

6434
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:14,400
have recording electrodes that are
 

6435
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,549
have recording electrodes that are
actually exposed iridium oxide recording

6436
02:15:16,549 --> 02:15:16,559
actually exposed iridium oxide recording
 

6437
02:15:16,559 --> 02:15:19,830
actually exposed iridium oxide recording
sites along the death this is only at a

6438
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:19,840
sites along the death this is only at a
 

6439
02:15:19,840 --> 02:15:22,669
sites along the death this is only at a
single death so these utar spokes can be

6440
02:15:22,669 --> 02:15:22,679
single death so these utar spokes can be
 

6441
02:15:22,679 --> 02:15:26,350
single death so these utar spokes can be
anywhere between .5 mm to 1.5 mm and

6442
02:15:26,350 --> 02:15:26,360
anywhere between .5 mm to 1.5 mm and
 

6443
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,990
anywhere between .5 mm to 1.5 mm and
they're they also have uh designs that

6444
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:28,000
they're they also have uh designs that
 

6445
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,149
they're they also have uh designs that
are slanted um so you can have it

6446
02:15:30,149 --> 02:15:30,159
are slanted um so you can have it
 

6447
02:15:30,159 --> 02:15:33,189
are slanted um so you can have it
inserted at different depth um but

6448
02:15:33,189 --> 02:15:33,199
inserted at different depth um but
 

6449
02:15:33,199 --> 02:15:35,390
inserted at different depth um but
that's one of the other big differences

6450
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:35,400
that's one of the other big differences
 

6451
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,030
that's one of the other big differences
and then uh I mean the main key

6452
02:15:37,030 --> 02:15:37,040
and then uh I mean the main key
 

6453
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:39,069
and then uh I mean the main key
difference is the fact that uh there's

6454
02:15:39,069 --> 02:15:39,079
difference is the fact that uh there's
 

6455
02:15:39,079 --> 02:15:41,069
difference is the fact that uh there's
no Active Electronics these are just

6456
02:15:41,069 --> 02:15:41,079
no Active Electronics these are just
 

6457
02:15:41,079 --> 02:15:42,870
no Active Electronics these are just
electrodes and then there's a bundle of

6458
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:42,880
electrodes and then there's a bundle of
 

6459
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:45,270
electrodes and then there's a bundle of
a wire that you're seeing and then that

6460
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:45,280
a wire that you're seeing and then that
 

6461
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:47,270
a wire that you're seeing and then that
actually then exits the

6462
02:15:47,270 --> 02:15:47,280
actually then exits the
 

6463
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:50,310
actually then exits the
craniectomy um that then has this port

6464
02:15:50,310 --> 02:15:50,320
craniectomy um that then has this port
 

6465
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:52,430
craniectomy um that then has this port
that you can connect to um for any

6466
02:15:52,430 --> 02:15:52,440
that you can connect to um for any
 

6467
02:15:52,440 --> 02:15:54,069
that you can connect to um for any
external electronic devices they are

6468
02:15:54,069 --> 02:15:54,079
external electronic devices they are
 

6469
02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:56,830
external electronic devices they are
working on a or have the wireless

6470
02:15:56,830 --> 02:15:56,840
working on a or have the wireless
 

6471
02:15:56,840 --> 02:15:58,750
working on a or have the wireless
Telemetry device but it still requires a

6472
02:15:58,750 --> 02:15:58,760
Telemetry device but it still requires a
 

6473
02:15:58,760 --> 02:16:02,589
Telemetry device but it still requires a
through the skin uh Port that actually

6474
02:16:02,589 --> 02:16:02,599
through the skin uh Port that actually
 

6475
02:16:02,599 --> 02:16:04,629
through the skin uh Port that actually
is one of the biggest failure modes for

6476
02:16:04,629 --> 02:16:04,639
is one of the biggest failure modes for
 

6477
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:07,189
is one of the biggest failure modes for
infection uh for the system what is some

6478
02:16:07,189 --> 02:16:07,199
infection uh for the system what is some
 

6479
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:10,750
infection uh for the system what is some
of the challenges associated with

6480
02:16:10,750 --> 02:16:10,760
of the challenges associated with
 

6481
02:16:10,760 --> 02:16:12,790
of the challenges associated with
flexible threads like for example on the

6482
02:16:12,790 --> 02:16:12,800
flexible threads like for example on the
 

6483
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,870
flexible threads like for example on the
robotic side

6484
02:16:14,870 --> 02:16:14,880
robotic side
 

6485
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:18,270
robotic side
R1 uh implanting those threads how

6486
02:16:18,270 --> 02:16:18,280
R1 uh implanting those threads how
 

6487
02:16:18,280 --> 02:16:21,229
R1 uh implanting those threads how
difficult does that t yeah um yeah so as

6488
02:16:21,229 --> 02:16:21,239
difficult does that t yeah um yeah so as
 

6489
02:16:21,239 --> 02:16:23,109
difficult does that t yeah um yeah so as
you mentioned they're they're very very

6490
02:16:23,109 --> 02:16:23,119
you mentioned they're they're very very
 

6491
02:16:23,119 --> 02:16:24,990
you mentioned they're they're very very
difficult to maneuver by hand um these

6492
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:25,000
difficult to maneuver by hand um these
 

6493
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,229
difficult to maneuver by hand um these
these utar rays that you you saw uh

6494
02:16:27,229 --> 02:16:27,239
these utar rays that you you saw uh
 

6495
02:16:27,239 --> 02:16:30,470
these utar rays that you you saw uh
earlier they're actually inserted by a

6496
02:16:30,470 --> 02:16:30,480
earlier they're actually inserted by a
 

6497
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:32,509
earlier they're actually inserted by a
neurosurgeon actually positioning it

6498
02:16:32,509 --> 02:16:32,519
neurosurgeon actually positioning it
 

6499
02:16:32,519 --> 02:16:34,509
neurosurgeon actually positioning it
near the site that they want and

6500
02:16:34,509 --> 02:16:34,519
near the site that they want and
 

6501
02:16:34,519 --> 02:16:36,549
near the site that they want and
then uh they're actually there's a

6502
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:36,559
then uh they're actually there's a
 

6503
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:37,990
then uh they're actually there's a
Pneumatic Hammer that actually pushes

6504
02:16:37,990 --> 02:16:38,000
Pneumatic Hammer that actually pushes
 

6505
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,950
Pneumatic Hammer that actually pushes
them in um so so it's a it's a pretty

6506
02:16:41,950 --> 02:16:41,960
them in um so so it's a it's a pretty
 

6507
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:44,230
them in um so so it's a it's a pretty
simple process um and they're easier to

6508
02:16:44,230 --> 02:16:44,240
simple process um and they're easier to
 

6509
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:47,230
simple process um and they're easier to
maneuver um but for for these thin FM

6510
02:16:47,230 --> 02:16:47,240
maneuver um but for for these thin FM
 

6511
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:49,509
maneuver um but for for these thin FM
arrays they're they're very very tiny

6512
02:16:49,509 --> 02:16:49,519
arrays they're they're very very tiny
 

6513
02:16:49,519 --> 02:16:52,030
arrays they're they're very very tiny
and uh flexible so they're they're very

6514
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:52,040
and uh flexible so they're they're very
 

6515
02:16:52,040 --> 02:16:53,589
and uh flexible so they're they're very
difficult to maneuver so that that's why

6516
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:53,599
difficult to maneuver so that that's why
 

6517
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:55,910
difficult to maneuver so that that's why
we built an entire robot to do that um

6518
02:16:55,910 --> 02:16:55,920
we built an entire robot to do that um
 

6519
02:16:55,920 --> 02:16:57,549
we built an entire robot to do that um
there are other other reasons for why we

6520
02:16:57,549 --> 02:16:57,559
there are other other reasons for why we
 

6521
02:16:57,559 --> 02:17:00,230
there are other other reasons for why we
built a robot um and and that is

6522
02:17:00,230 --> 02:17:00,240
built a robot um and and that is
 

6523
02:17:00,240 --> 02:17:02,349
built a robot um and and that is
ultimately we want this to help millions

6524
02:17:02,349 --> 02:17:02,359
ultimately we want this to help millions
 

6525
02:17:02,359 --> 02:17:03,870
ultimately we want this to help millions
and millions of people that can benefit

6526
02:17:03,870 --> 02:17:03,880
and millions of people that can benefit
 

6527
02:17:03,880 --> 02:17:05,509
and millions of people that can benefit
from this and there just aren't that

6528
02:17:05,509 --> 02:17:05,519
from this and there just aren't that
 

6529
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:09,509
from this and there just aren't that
many neurosurgeons out there um and uh

6530
02:17:09,509 --> 02:17:09,519
many neurosurgeons out there um and uh
 

6531
02:17:09,519 --> 02:17:12,910
many neurosurgeons out there um and uh
you know robots can be uh something that

6532
02:17:12,910 --> 02:17:12,920
you know robots can be uh something that
 

6533
02:17:12,920 --> 02:17:14,870
you know robots can be uh something that
you know we hope can actually do large

6534
02:17:14,870 --> 02:17:14,880
you know we hope can actually do large
 

6535
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:19,070
you know we hope can actually do large
parts of the surgery um but yeah yeah

6536
02:17:19,070 --> 02:17:19,080
parts of the surgery um but yeah yeah
 

6537
02:17:19,080 --> 02:17:21,870
parts of the surgery um but yeah yeah
the the the robot is this entire other

6538
02:17:21,870 --> 02:17:21,880
the the the robot is this entire other
 

6539
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:25,150
the the the robot is this entire other
um sort of category of product that

6540
02:17:25,150 --> 02:17:25,160
um sort of category of product that
 

6541
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:28,469
um sort of category of product that
we're working on and it it's essentially

6542
02:17:28,469 --> 02:17:28,479
we're working on and it it's essentially
 

6543
02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:30,150
we're working on and it it's essentially
this

6544
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:30,160
this
 

6545
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:34,070
this
multi-axis Gantry system that has the

6546
02:17:34,070 --> 02:17:34,080
multi-axis Gantry system that has the
 

6547
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:37,389
multi-axis Gantry system that has the
specialized robot head um that has all

6548
02:17:37,389 --> 02:17:37,399
specialized robot head um that has all
 

6549
02:17:37,399 --> 02:17:42,150
specialized robot head um that has all
of the Optics and um this this kind of a

6550
02:17:42,150 --> 02:17:42,160
of the Optics and um this this kind of a
 

6551
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:45,910
of the Optics and um this this kind of a
needle retracting mechanism that maners

6552
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:45,920
needle retracting mechanism that maners
 

6553
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:48,230
needle retracting mechanism that maners
these these threads

6554
02:17:48,230 --> 02:17:48,240
these these threads
 

6555
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:51,910
these these threads
um via this Loop structure that you have

6556
02:17:51,910 --> 02:17:51,920
um via this Loop structure that you have
 

6557
02:17:51,920 --> 02:17:53,429
um via this Loop structure that you have
on the thread so the thread already has

6558
02:17:53,429 --> 02:17:53,439
on the thread so the thread already has
 

6559
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:54,910
on the thread so the thread already has
a loop structure by which you can grab

6560
02:17:54,910 --> 02:17:54,920
a loop structure by which you can grab
 

6561
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:56,910
a loop structure by which you can grab
it correct correct so this is

6562
02:17:56,910 --> 02:17:56,920
it correct correct so this is
 

6563
02:17:56,920 --> 02:17:58,790
it correct correct so this is
fascinating so you mentioned Optics so

6564
02:17:58,790 --> 02:17:58,800
fascinating so you mentioned Optics so
 

6565
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:02,509
fascinating so you mentioned Optics so
there's a robot R1 so for now there's a

6566
02:18:02,509 --> 02:18:02,519
there's a robot R1 so for now there's a
 

6567
02:18:02,519 --> 02:18:07,030
there's a robot R1 so for now there's a
human that actually creates uh a hole in

6568
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:07,040
human that actually creates uh a hole in
 

6569
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:10,790
human that actually creates uh a hole in
the in the skull and then after that

6570
02:18:10,790 --> 02:18:10,800
the in the skull and then after that
 

6571
02:18:10,800 --> 02:18:13,190
the in the skull and then after that
there's a computer vision component

6572
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:13,200
there's a computer vision component
 

6573
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:16,910
there's a computer vision component
that's finding a way to avoid the blood

6574
02:18:16,910 --> 02:18:16,920
that's finding a way to avoid the blood
 

6575
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:19,070
that's finding a way to avoid the blood
vessels and then you're grabbing it by

6576
02:18:19,070 --> 02:18:19,080
vessels and then you're grabbing it by
 

6577
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:21,309
vessels and then you're grabbing it by
the loop each individual thread and

6578
02:18:21,309 --> 02:18:21,319
the loop each individual thread and
 

6579
02:18:21,319 --> 02:18:23,669
the loop each individual thread and
placing it in a particular location to

6580
02:18:23,669 --> 02:18:23,679
placing it in a particular location to
 

6581
02:18:23,679 --> 02:18:25,549
placing it in a particular location to
avoid the blood vessels and also

6582
02:18:25,549 --> 02:18:25,559
avoid the blood vessels and also
 

6583
02:18:25,559 --> 02:18:27,950
avoid the blood vessels and also
choosing the depth of placement all that

6584
02:18:27,950 --> 02:18:27,960
choosing the depth of placement all that
 

6585
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:29,950
choosing the depth of placement all that
so controlling every like the 3D

6586
02:18:29,950 --> 02:18:29,960
so controlling every like the 3D
 

6587
02:18:29,960 --> 02:18:32,870
so controlling every like the 3D
geometry of the placement correct so the

6588
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:32,880
geometry of the placement correct so the
 

6589
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:34,790
geometry of the placement correct so the
the aspect of this robot that is unique

6590
02:18:34,790 --> 02:18:34,800
the aspect of this robot that is unique
 

6591
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:37,669
the aspect of this robot that is unique
is that it's not surgeon assisted or

6592
02:18:37,669 --> 02:18:37,679
is that it's not surgeon assisted or
 

6593
02:18:37,679 --> 02:18:40,589
is that it's not surgeon assisted or
human assisted it's a semi-automatic or

6594
02:18:40,589 --> 02:18:40,599
human assisted it's a semi-automatic or
 

6595
02:18:40,599 --> 02:18:43,150
human assisted it's a semi-automatic or
automatic uh robot once you you know

6596
02:18:43,150 --> 02:18:43,160
automatic uh robot once you you know
 

6597
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:44,709
automatic uh robot once you you know
obviously there are human component to

6598
02:18:44,709 --> 02:18:44,719
obviously there are human component to
 

6599
02:18:44,719 --> 02:18:47,150
obviously there are human component to
it when you're placing Target um you can

6600
02:18:47,150 --> 02:18:47,160
it when you're placing Target um you can
 

6601
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:49,870
it when you're placing Target um you can
always move it away from kind of major

6602
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:49,880
always move it away from kind of major
 

6603
02:18:49,880 --> 02:18:51,469
always move it away from kind of major
vessels that you see

6604
02:18:51,469 --> 02:18:51,479
vessels that you see
 

6605
02:18:51,479 --> 02:18:53,549
vessels that you see
um but I mean we want to get to a point

6606
02:18:53,549 --> 02:18:53,559
um but I mean we want to get to a point
 

6607
02:18:53,559 --> 02:18:55,509
um but I mean we want to get to a point
where one click and it just does the

6608
02:18:55,509 --> 02:18:55,519
where one click and it just does the
 

6609
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:58,070
where one click and it just does the
surgery within minutes so the computer

6610
02:18:58,070 --> 02:18:58,080
surgery within minutes so the computer
 

6611
02:18:58,080 --> 02:19:02,030
surgery within minutes so the computer
vision component finds great targets

6612
02:19:02,030 --> 02:19:02,040
vision component finds great targets
 

6613
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:03,589
vision component finds great targets
candidates and the human kind of

6614
02:19:03,589 --> 02:19:03,599
candidates and the human kind of
 

6615
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:06,070
candidates and the human kind of
approves them and the robot does is does

6616
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:06,080
approves them and the robot does is does
 

6617
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,830
approves them and the robot does is does
it do like one3 at a time or does it do

6618
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:07,840
it do like one3 at a time or does it do
 

6619
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,389
it do like one3 at a time or does it do
it does one thread at a time uh and

6620
02:19:09,389 --> 02:19:09,399
it does one thread at a time uh and
 

6621
02:19:09,399 --> 02:19:10,830
it does one thread at a time uh and
that's that's actually also one thing

6622
02:19:10,830 --> 02:19:10,840
that's that's actually also one thing
 

6623
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:14,830
that's that's actually also one thing
that we um uh are looking at ways to do

6624
02:19:14,830 --> 02:19:14,840
that we um uh are looking at ways to do
 

6625
02:19:14,840 --> 02:19:16,429
that we um uh are looking at ways to do
multiple threads at a time there's

6626
02:19:16,429 --> 02:19:16,439
multiple threads at a time there's
 

6627
02:19:16,439 --> 02:19:17,950
multiple threads at a time there's
nothing stopping from it you can have

6628
02:19:17,950 --> 02:19:17,960
nothing stopping from it you can have
 

6629
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:21,070
nothing stopping from it you can have
multiple kind of Engagement uh

6630
02:19:21,070 --> 02:19:21,080
multiple kind of Engagement uh
 

6631
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:23,429
multiple kind of Engagement uh
mechanisms um but right now it's one by

6632
02:19:23,429 --> 02:19:23,439
mechanisms um but right now it's one by
 

6633
02:19:23,439 --> 02:19:27,070
mechanisms um but right now it's one by
one and uh you know we also still do

6634
02:19:27,070 --> 02:19:27,080
one and uh you know we also still do
 

6635
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,830
one and uh you know we also still do
quite a bit of just just kind of

6636
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:28,840
quite a bit of just just kind of
 

6637
02:19:28,840 --> 02:19:30,190
quite a bit of just just kind of
verification to make sure that it got

6638
02:19:30,190 --> 02:19:30,200
verification to make sure that it got
 

6639
02:19:30,200 --> 02:19:32,230
verification to make sure that it got
inserted if so how deep you know did it

6640
02:19:32,230 --> 02:19:32,240
inserted if so how deep you know did it
 

6641
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:34,589
inserted if so how deep you know did it
actually match um what was programmed in

6642
02:19:34,589 --> 02:19:34,599
actually match um what was programmed in
 

6643
02:19:34,599 --> 02:19:36,790
actually match um what was programmed in
and you know so on and so forth and the

6644
02:19:36,790 --> 02:19:36,800
and you know so on and so forth and the
 

6645
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:39,150
and you know so on and so forth and the
the actual electros are placed a very at

6646
02:19:39,150 --> 02:19:39,160
the actual electros are placed a very at
 

6647
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:42,990
the actual electros are placed a very at
differing depths in the uh like I mean

6648
02:19:42,990 --> 02:19:43,000
differing depths in the uh like I mean
 

6649
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,309
differing depths in the uh like I mean
it's very small differences but

6650
02:19:44,309 --> 02:19:44,319
it's very small differences but
 

6651
02:19:44,319 --> 02:19:47,429
it's very small differences but
differences yeah yeah and so that

6652
02:19:47,429 --> 02:19:47,439
differences yeah yeah and so that
 

6653
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:49,830
differences yeah yeah and so that
there's some reasoning behind that as

6654
02:19:49,830 --> 02:19:49,840
there's some reasoning behind that as
 

6655
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:53,910
there's some reasoning behind that as
you mentioned like it it gets more

6656
02:19:53,910 --> 02:19:53,920
you mentioned like it it gets more
 

6657
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:55,110
you mentioned like it it gets more
varied

6658
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:55,120
varied
 

6659
02:19:55,120 --> 02:19:57,710
varied
signal yeah we I mean we try to place

6660
02:19:57,710 --> 02:19:57,720
signal yeah we I mean we try to place
 

6661
02:19:57,720 --> 02:20:02,910
signal yeah we I mean we try to place
them all around 3 or 4 millim from the

6662
02:20:02,910 --> 02:20:02,920
them all around 3 or 4 millim from the
 

6663
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:05,429
them all around 3 or 4 millim from the
surface um just cuz the span of the

6664
02:20:05,429 --> 02:20:05,439
surface um just cuz the span of the
 

6665
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:07,349
surface um just cuz the span of the
electrode those 16 electrod that we

6666
02:20:07,349 --> 02:20:07,359
electrode those 16 electrod that we
 

6667
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:10,670
electrode those 16 electrod that we
currently have in this uh version spans

6668
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:10,680
currently have in this uh version spans
 

6669
02:20:10,680 --> 02:20:13,190
currently have in this uh version spans
um you know roughly around 3 mm so we

6670
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,200
um you know roughly around 3 mm so we
 

6671
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:15,309
um you know roughly around 3 mm so we
want to get all of those in the

6672
02:20:15,309 --> 02:20:15,319
want to get all of those in the
 

6673
02:20:15,319 --> 02:20:17,790
want to get all of those in the
brain this is fascinating okay so

6674
02:20:17,790 --> 02:20:17,800
brain this is fascinating okay so
 

6675
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:19,510
brain this is fascinating okay so
there's a million questions here if we

6676
02:20:19,510 --> 02:20:19,520
there's a million questions here if we
 

6677
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:21,790
there's a million questions here if we
go zoom in specific on the electrod so

6678
02:20:21,790 --> 02:20:21,800
go zoom in specific on the electrod so
 

6679
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:24,510
go zoom in specific on the electrod so
what is your sense how many neurons is

6680
02:20:24,510 --> 02:20:24,520
what is your sense how many neurons is
 

6681
02:20:24,520 --> 02:20:27,070
what is your sense how many neurons is
each individual Electro listening to

6682
02:20:27,070 --> 02:20:27,080
each individual Electro listening to
 

6683
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,950
each individual Electro listening to
yeah each Electro can record from

6684
02:20:28,950 --> 02:20:28,960
yeah each Electro can record from
 

6685
02:20:28,960 --> 02:20:32,030
yeah each Electro can record from
anywhere between zero to 40 as I

6686
02:20:32,030 --> 02:20:32,040
anywhere between zero to 40 as I
 

6687
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:34,790
anywhere between zero to 40 as I
mentioned right earlier um but

6688
02:20:34,790 --> 02:20:34,800
mentioned right earlier um but
 

6689
02:20:34,800 --> 02:20:38,429
mentioned right earlier um but
practically speaking uh we only see

6690
02:20:38,429 --> 02:20:38,439
practically speaking uh we only see
 

6691
02:20:38,439 --> 02:20:41,550
practically speaking uh we only see
about at most like two to three um and

6692
02:20:41,550 --> 02:20:41,560
about at most like two to three um and
 

6693
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:43,110
about at most like two to three um and
you can actually distinguish which

6694
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:43,120
you can actually distinguish which
 

6695
02:20:43,120 --> 02:20:46,389
you can actually distinguish which
neuron it's coming from by the shape of

6696
02:20:46,389 --> 02:20:46,399
neuron it's coming from by the shape of
 

6697
02:20:46,399 --> 02:20:50,389
neuron it's coming from by the shape of
the spikes oh cool um so I mentioned the

6698
02:20:50,389 --> 02:20:50,399
the spikes oh cool um so I mentioned the
 

6699
02:20:50,399 --> 02:20:52,030
the spikes oh cool um so I mentioned the
 like detection algorithm that we

6700
02:20:52,030 --> 02:20:52,040
like detection algorithm that we
 

6701
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:56,389
like detection algorithm that we
have it's called boss algorithm um

6702
02:20:56,389 --> 02:20:56,399
have it's called boss algorithm um
 

6703
02:20:56,399 --> 02:20:59,469
have it's called boss algorithm um
buffer online Spike sorter nice it

6704
02:20:59,469 --> 02:20:59,479
buffer online Spike sorter nice it
 

6705
02:20:59,479 --> 02:21:01,790
buffer online Spike sorter nice it
actually outputs at the end of the day

6706
02:21:01,790 --> 02:21:01,800
actually outputs at the end of the day
 

6707
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:06,270
actually outputs at the end of the day
uh six unique values which are um you

6708
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:06,280
uh six unique values which are um you
 

6709
02:21:06,280 --> 02:21:08,550
uh six unique values which are um you
know kind of the amplitude of these like

6710
02:21:08,550 --> 02:21:08,560
know kind of the amplitude of these like
 

6711
02:21:08,560 --> 02:21:11,670
know kind of the amplitude of these like
negative going Hump Middle hump like uh

6712
02:21:11,670 --> 02:21:11,680
negative going Hump Middle hump like uh
 

6713
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:13,469
negative going Hump Middle hump like uh
positive going hump and then also the

6714
02:21:13,469 --> 02:21:13,479
positive going hump and then also the
 

6715
02:21:13,479 --> 02:21:16,190
positive going hump and then also the
time at which these happen and from that

6716
02:21:16,190 --> 02:21:16,200
time at which these happen and from that
 

6717
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:18,510
time at which these happen and from that
you can have a you kind of a statistical

6718
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:18,520
you can have a you kind of a statistical
 

6719
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:21,070
you can have a you kind of a statistical
probab probability um estimate of is

6720
02:21:21,070 --> 02:21:21,080
probab probability um estimate of is
 

6721
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:22,469
probab probability um estimate of is
that a spike is it not a spike and then

6722
02:21:22,469 --> 02:21:22,479
that a spike is it not a spike and then
 

6723
02:21:22,479 --> 02:21:24,630
that a spike is it not a spike and then
based on that you could also determine

6724
02:21:24,630 --> 02:21:24,640
based on that you could also determine
 

6725
02:21:24,640 --> 02:21:26,230
based on that you could also determine
oh that Spike looks different than that

6726
02:21:26,230 --> 02:21:26,240
oh that Spike looks different than that
 

6727
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:28,070
oh that Spike looks different than that
Spike must come from a different neuron

6728
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:28,080
Spike must come from a different neuron
 

6729
02:21:28,080 --> 02:21:31,110
Spike must come from a different neuron
okay so that that's a nice signal

6730
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:31,120
okay so that that's a nice signal
 

6731
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:33,389
okay so that that's a nice signal
processing step from which you can then

6732
02:21:33,389 --> 02:21:33,399
processing step from which you can then
 

6733
02:21:33,399 --> 02:21:34,910
processing step from which you can then
make much better predictions about if

6734
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:34,920
make much better predictions about if
 

6735
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:36,429
make much better predictions about if
there's a spike especially in this kind

6736
02:21:36,429 --> 02:21:36,439
there's a spike especially in this kind
 

6737
02:21:36,439 --> 02:21:38,150
there's a spike especially in this kind
of context where there could be multiple

6738
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:38,160
of context where there could be multiple
 

6739
02:21:38,160 --> 02:21:40,070
of context where there could be multiple
neurons

6740
02:21:40,070 --> 02:21:40,080
neurons
 

6741
02:21:40,080 --> 02:21:42,790
neurons
screaming and that that also results in

6742
02:21:42,790 --> 02:21:42,800
screaming and that that also results in
 

6743
02:21:42,800 --> 02:21:44,150
screaming and that that also results in
you being able to compress the data

6744
02:21:44,150 --> 02:21:44,160
you being able to compress the data
 

6745
02:21:44,160 --> 02:21:46,830
you being able to compress the data
better yeah of day okay that's and just

6746
02:21:46,830 --> 02:21:46,840
better yeah of day okay that's and just
 

6747
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:49,510
better yeah of day okay that's and just
to be clear I mean there the the labs do

6748
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:49,520
to be clear I mean there the the labs do
 

6749
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:52,070
to be clear I mean there the the labs do
this what's called Spike sorting um

6750
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:52,080
this what's called Spike sorting um
 

6751
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:54,070
this what's called Spike sorting um
usually once you have these like

6752
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:54,080
usually once you have these like
 

6753
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:57,030
usually once you have these like
Broadband you know like the fully

6754
02:21:57,030 --> 02:21:57,040
Broadband you know like the fully
 

6755
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:00,190
Broadband you know like the fully
digitized signals and then you run a

6756
02:22:00,190 --> 02:22:00,200
digitized signals and then you run a
 

6757
02:22:00,200 --> 02:22:01,990
digitized signals and then you run a
bunch of different set of algorithms to

6758
02:22:01,990 --> 02:22:02,000
bunch of different set of algorithms to
 

6759
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,030
bunch of different set of algorithms to
kind of tease apart it's just all of

6760
02:22:04,030 --> 02:22:04,040
kind of tease apart it's just all of
 

6761
02:22:04,040 --> 02:22:07,110
kind of tease apart it's just all of
this for us is done on the device on the

6777
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:26,910
uh you know a very very short amount of

6778
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:26,920
time oh yeah so the latency has to be
 

6779
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:30,070
time oh yeah so the latency has to be
super short correct oh wow oh that's a

6780
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:30,080
super short correct oh wow oh that's a
 

6781
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:32,429
super short correct oh wow oh that's a
pain in the ass yeah latency is this uh

6782
02:22:32,429 --> 02:22:32,439
pain in the ass yeah latency is this uh
 

6783
02:22:32,439 --> 02:22:34,110
pain in the ass yeah latency is this uh
huge huge thing that you have to deal

6784
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:34,120
huge huge thing that you have to deal
 

6785
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:36,110
huge huge thing that you have to deal
with uh right now the biggest source of

6786
02:22:36,110 --> 02:22:36,120
with uh right now the biggest source of
 

6787
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:38,950
with uh right now the biggest source of
latency comes from the Bluetooth uh the

6788
02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:38,960
latency comes from the Bluetooth uh the
 

6789
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:40,510
latency comes from the Bluetooth uh the
the way in which they're packetized and

6790
02:22:40,510 --> 02:22:40,520
the way in which they're packetized and
 

6791
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:43,270
the way in which they're packetized and
you know we bend them in 15 millisecond

6792
02:22:43,270 --> 02:22:43,280
you know we bend them in 15 millisecond
 

6793
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:45,550
you know we bend them in 15 millisecond
inter communication constraint is there

6794
02:22:45,550 --> 02:22:45,560
inter communication constraint is there
 

6795
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:47,190
inter communication constraint is there
some potential Innovation there on the

6796
02:22:47,190 --> 02:22:47,200
some potential Innovation there on the
 

6797
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:49,790
some potential Innovation there on the
protocol used absolutely okay yeah

6798
02:22:49,790 --> 02:22:49,800
protocol used absolutely okay yeah
 

6799
02:22:49,800 --> 02:22:53,870
protocol used absolutely okay yeah
Bluetooth is definitely not uh our

6800
02:22:53,870 --> 02:22:53,880
Bluetooth is definitely not uh our
 

6801
02:22:53,880 --> 02:22:57,469
Bluetooth is definitely not uh our
final uh wireless communication protocol

6802
02:22:57,469 --> 02:22:57,479
final uh wireless communication protocol
 

6803
02:22:57,479 --> 02:22:59,190
final uh wireless communication protocol
that we want to get to it's a high H

6804
02:22:59,190 --> 02:22:59,200
that we want to get to it's a high H
 

6805
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:02,910
that we want to get to it's a high H
hence the N1 and the R1 I imagine that

6806
02:23:02,910 --> 02:23:02,920
hence the N1 and the R1 I imagine that
 

6807
02:23:02,920 --> 02:23:05,670
hence the N1 and the R1 I imagine that
increases NX

6808
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:05,680
increases NX
 

6809
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,469
increases NX
RX uh yeah that's you know the

6810
02:23:08,469 --> 02:23:08,479
RX uh yeah that's you know the
 

6811
02:23:08,479 --> 02:23:11,070
RX uh yeah that's you know the
communication protocol because Bluetooth

6812
02:23:11,070 --> 02:23:11,080
communication protocol because Bluetooth
 

6813
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:13,070
communication protocol because Bluetooth
uh allows you to communicate against

6814
02:23:13,070 --> 02:23:13,080
uh allows you to communicate against
 

6815
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:14,990
uh allows you to communicate against
farther distances than you need to so

6816
02:23:14,990 --> 02:23:15,000
farther distances than you need to so
 

6817
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,150
farther distances than you need to so
you can go much shorter yeah the only uh

6818
02:23:17,150 --> 02:23:17,160
you can go much shorter yeah the only uh
 

6819
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:18,990
you can go much shorter yeah the only uh
well the primary motivation for choosing

6820
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:19,000
well the primary motivation for choosing
 

6821
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,269
well the primary motivation for choosing
Bluetooth is that I everything has

6822
02:23:21,269 --> 02:23:21,279
Bluetooth is that I everything has
 

6823
02:23:21,279 --> 02:23:22,870
Bluetooth is that I everything has
Bluetooth all right so you can talk to

6824
02:23:22,870 --> 02:23:22,880
Bluetooth all right so you can talk to
 

6825
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:25,710
Bluetooth all right so you can talk to
any devic interoperability is just

6826
02:23:25,710 --> 02:23:25,720
any devic interoperability is just
 

6827
02:23:25,720 --> 02:23:27,590
any devic interoperability is just
absolutely essential especially in this

6828
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:27,600
absolutely essential especially in this
 

6829
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:30,389
absolutely essential especially in this
early phase um and in many ways if you

6830
02:23:30,389 --> 02:23:30,399
early phase um and in many ways if you
 

6831
02:23:30,399 --> 02:23:33,070
early phase um and in many ways if you
can access a phone or a computer you can

6832
02:23:33,070 --> 02:23:33,080
can access a phone or a computer you can
 

6833
02:23:33,080 --> 02:23:34,349
can access a phone or a computer you can
do

6834
02:23:34,349 --> 02:23:34,359
do
 

6835
02:23:34,359 --> 02:23:36,630
do
anything it be interesting to step back

6836
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:36,640
anything it be interesting to step back
 

6837
02:23:36,640 --> 02:23:39,230
anything it be interesting to step back
and actually look at again the same

6838
02:23:39,230 --> 02:23:39,240
and actually look at again the same
 

6839
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:42,830
and actually look at again the same
pipeline that you mentioned for Nolan

6840
02:23:42,830 --> 02:23:42,840
pipeline that you mentioned for Nolan
 

6841
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:46,710
pipeline that you mentioned for Nolan
so what is this whole process look like

6842
02:23:46,710 --> 02:23:46,720
so what is this whole process look like
 

6843
02:23:46,720 --> 02:23:50,070
so what is this whole process look like
from finding and selecting a human being

6844
02:23:50,070 --> 02:23:50,080
from finding and selecting a human being
 

6845
02:23:50,080 --> 02:23:52,910
from finding and selecting a human being
to the the to the surgery to the the

6846
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:52,920
to the the to the surgery to the the
 

6847
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:55,830
to the the to the surgery to the the
first time he's able to use this thing

6848
02:23:55,830 --> 02:23:55,840
first time he's able to use this thing
 

6849
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,870
first time he's able to use this thing
so we have what's called a patient

6850
02:23:57,870 --> 02:23:57,880
so we have what's called a patient
 

6851
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:01,429
so we have what's called a patient
registry that people can sign up to um

6852
02:24:01,429 --> 02:24:01,439
registry that people can sign up to um
 

6853
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:04,190
registry that people can sign up to um
you know hear more about the updates and

6854
02:24:04,190 --> 02:24:04,200
you know hear more about the updates and
 

6855
02:24:04,200 --> 02:24:07,269
you know hear more about the updates and
that was a route to which Nolan applied

6856
02:24:07,269 --> 02:24:07,279
that was a route to which Nolan applied
 

6857
02:24:07,279 --> 02:24:09,269
that was a route to which Nolan applied
and the process is that once the

6858
02:24:09,269 --> 02:24:09,279
and the process is that once the
 

6859
02:24:09,279 --> 02:24:11,110
and the process is that once the
application comes in you know it it

6860
02:24:11,110 --> 02:24:11,120
application comes in you know it it
 

6861
02:24:11,120 --> 02:24:14,670
application comes in you know it it
contains some medical records and

6862
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:14,680
contains some medical records and
 

6863
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:17,230
contains some medical records and
we uh you know based on their medical

6864
02:24:17,230 --> 02:24:17,240
we uh you know based on their medical
 

6865
02:24:17,240 --> 02:24:19,110
we uh you know based on their medical
eligibility that there's a lot of

6866
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:19,120
eligibility that there's a lot of
 

6867
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:21,070
eligibility that there's a lot of
different inclusion exclusion criteria

6868
02:24:21,070 --> 02:24:21,080
different inclusion exclusion criteria
 

6869
02:24:21,080 --> 02:24:23,309
different inclusion exclusion criteria
for them to meet and we go through a

6870
02:24:23,309 --> 02:24:23,319
for them to meet and we go through a
 

6871
02:24:23,319 --> 02:24:25,230
for them to meet and we go through a
pre-screening interview process with

6872
02:24:25,230 --> 02:24:25,240
pre-screening interview process with
 

6873
02:24:25,240 --> 02:24:28,269
pre-screening interview process with
someone from neuralink and at some point

6874
02:24:28,269 --> 02:24:28,279
someone from neuralink and at some point
 

6875
02:24:28,279 --> 02:24:31,469
someone from neuralink and at some point
we also go out to their homes to do a

6876
02:24:31,469 --> 02:24:31,479
we also go out to their homes to do a
 

6877
02:24:31,479 --> 02:24:34,150
we also go out to their homes to do a
BCI home audit um because one one of the

6878
02:24:34,150 --> 02:24:34,160
BCI home audit um because one one of the
 

6879
02:24:34,160 --> 02:24:36,790
BCI home audit um because one one of the
most kind of revolutionary part about

6880
02:24:36,790 --> 02:24:36,800
most kind of revolutionary part about
 

6881
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:39,150
most kind of revolutionary part about
you know having this N1 system that is

6882
02:24:39,150 --> 02:24:39,160
you know having this N1 system that is
 

6883
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:40,870
you know having this N1 system that is
completely wireless is that you can use

6884
02:24:40,870 --> 02:24:40,880
completely wireless is that you can use
 

6885
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:42,190
completely wireless is that you can use
it at home like you don't actually have

6886
02:24:42,190 --> 02:24:42,200
it at home like you don't actually have
 

6887
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:45,349
it at home like you don't actually have
to go to the lab um and and you know go

6888
02:24:45,349 --> 02:24:45,359
to go to the lab um and and you know go
 

6889
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:47,870
to go to the lab um and and you know go
to the clinic to get connectorized to

6890
02:24:47,870 --> 02:24:47,880
to the clinic to get connectorized to
 

6891
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:49,230
to the clinic to get connectorized to
these like specialized equipment that

6892
02:24:49,230 --> 02:24:49,240
these like specialized equipment that
 

6893
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:50,910
these like specialized equipment that
you can't take home with you

6894
02:24:50,910 --> 02:24:50,920
you can't take home with you
 

6895
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:54,269
you can't take home with you
um so that's one of the the key elements

6896
02:24:54,269 --> 02:24:54,279
um so that's one of the the key elements
 

6897
02:24:54,279 --> 02:24:56,030
um so that's one of the the key elements
of you know when we're designing the

6898
02:24:56,030 --> 02:24:56,040
of you know when we're designing the
 

6899
02:24:56,040 --> 02:24:57,309
of you know when we're designing the
system that we wanted to keep in mind

6900
02:24:57,309 --> 02:24:57,319
system that we wanted to keep in mind
 

6901
02:24:57,319 --> 02:24:59,469
system that we wanted to keep in mind
like you know people you know hopefully

6902
02:24:59,469 --> 02:24:59,479
like you know people you know hopefully
 

6903
02:24:59,479 --> 02:25:01,630
like you know people you know hopefully
would want to be able to use us every

6904
02:25:01,630 --> 02:25:01,640
would want to be able to use us every
 

6905
02:25:01,640 --> 02:25:05,389
would want to be able to use us every
day in the comfort of their homes and um

6906
02:25:05,389 --> 02:25:05,399
day in the comfort of their homes and um
 

6907
02:25:05,399 --> 02:25:07,950
day in the comfort of their homes and um
so part of our engagement and and what

6908
02:25:07,950 --> 02:25:07,960
so part of our engagement and and what
 

6909
02:25:07,960 --> 02:25:09,910
so part of our engagement and and what
we're looking for during BCI home audit

6910
02:25:09,910 --> 02:25:09,920
we're looking for during BCI home audit
 

6911
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:11,190
we're looking for during BCI home audit
is to just kind of understand their

6912
02:25:11,190 --> 02:25:11,200
is to just kind of understand their
 

6913
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:13,190
is to just kind of understand their
situation what other assisted technology

6914
02:25:13,190 --> 02:25:13,200
situation what other assisted technology
 

6915
02:25:13,200 --> 02:25:14,990
situation what other assisted technology
that they use and we should also step

6916
02:25:14,990 --> 02:25:15,000
that they use and we should also step
 

6917
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,950
that they use and we should also step
back and kind of say that uh the

6918
02:25:17,950 --> 02:25:17,960
back and kind of say that uh the
 

6919
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:20,790
back and kind of say that uh the
estimate is uh 180,000

6920
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:20,800
estimate is uh 180,000
 

6921
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:22,510
estimate is uh 180,000
people live with quadriplegia in the

6922
02:25:22,510 --> 02:25:22,520
people live with quadriplegia in the
 

6923
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:24,429
people live with quadriplegia in the
United States and each year an

6924
02:25:24,429 --> 02:25:24,439
United States and each year an
 

6925
02:25:24,439 --> 02:25:27,550
United States and each year an
additional 18,000 suffer uh a paralyzing

6926
02:25:27,550 --> 02:25:27,560
additional 18,000 suffer uh a paralyzing
 

6927
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:32,590
additional 18,000 suffer uh a paralyzing
spinal cord injury so these are folks uh

6928
02:25:32,590 --> 02:25:32,600
spinal cord injury so these are folks uh
 

6929
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:36,150
spinal cord injury so these are folks uh
who have a lot of challenges living life

6930
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:36,160
who have a lot of challenges living life
 

6931
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:38,670
who have a lot of challenges living life
in terms of accessibility in terms of

6932
02:25:38,670 --> 02:25:38,680
in terms of accessibility in terms of
 

6933
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:40,590
in terms of accessibility in terms of
doing the things that many of us just

6934
02:25:40,590 --> 02:25:40,600
doing the things that many of us just
 

6935
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:42,630
doing the things that many of us just
take for granted dayto day and one of

6936
02:25:42,630 --> 02:25:42,640
take for granted dayto day and one of
 

6937
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:44,269
take for granted dayto day and one of
the things one of the goals of this

6938
02:25:44,269 --> 02:25:44,279
the things one of the goals of this
 

6939
02:25:44,279 --> 02:25:48,469
the things one of the goals of this
initial study is to enable them to have

6940
02:25:48,469 --> 02:25:48,479
initial study is to enable them to have
 

6941
02:25:48,479 --> 02:25:51,349
initial study is to enable them to have
sort of digital autonomy where they by

6942
02:25:51,349 --> 02:25:51,359
sort of digital autonomy where they by
 

6943
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:52,910
sort of digital autonomy where they by
themselves can interact with a digital

6944
02:25:52,910 --> 02:25:52,920
themselves can interact with a digital
 

6945
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:55,469
themselves can interact with a digital
device using just their mind something

6946
02:25:55,469 --> 02:25:55,479
device using just their mind something
 

6947
02:25:55,479 --> 02:25:57,950
device using just their mind something
that you're calling telepathy so digital

6948
02:25:57,950 --> 02:25:57,960
that you're calling telepathy so digital
 

6949
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:01,190
that you're calling telepathy so digital
telepathy where uh a quadruple can

6950
02:26:01,190 --> 02:26:01,200
telepathy where uh a quadruple can
 

6951
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:03,590
telepathy where uh a quadruple can
communicate with a digital device in all

6952
02:26:03,590 --> 02:26:03,600
communicate with a digital device in all
 

6953
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:05,670
communicate with a digital device in all
the ways that we've been talking

6954
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:05,680
the ways that we've been talking
 

6955
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:10,190
the ways that we've been talking
about uh control the mouse cursor enough

6956
02:26:10,190 --> 02:26:10,200
about uh control the mouse cursor enough
 

6957
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:11,630
about uh control the mouse cursor enough
to be able to do all kinds of stuff

6958
02:26:11,630 --> 02:26:11,640
to be able to do all kinds of stuff
 

6959
02:26:11,640 --> 02:26:13,510
to be able to do all kinds of stuff
including play games and tweet and all

including play games and tweet and all
 

6961
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:15,790
including play games and tweet and all
that kind of stuff and there's there's a

6962
02:26:15,790 --> 02:26:15,800
that kind of stuff and there's there's a
 

6963
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:18,070
that kind of stuff and there's there's a
lot of people for whom life the basics

6964
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:18,080
lot of people for whom life the basics
 

6965
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:21,150
lot of people for whom life the basics
of Life are difficult

6966
02:26:21,150 --> 02:26:21,160
of Life are difficult
 

6967
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:23,110
of Life are difficult
uh because of the things that have

6968
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:23,120
uh because of the things that have
 

6969
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:25,670
uh because of the things that have
happened to them so yeah I mean movement

6970
02:26:25,670 --> 02:26:25,680
happened to them so yeah I mean movement
 

6971
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:29,510
happened to them so yeah I mean movement
is so so fundamental to our ex existence

6972
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:29,520
is so so fundamental to our ex existence
 

6973
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:32,309
is so so fundamental to our ex existence
I mean even even speaking involves

6974
02:26:32,309 --> 02:26:32,319
I mean even even speaking involves
 

6975
02:26:32,319 --> 02:26:37,150
I mean even even speaking involves
movement of mouth lip larynx and um

6976
02:26:37,150 --> 02:26:37,160
movement of mouth lip larynx and um
 

6977
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:40,070
movement of mouth lip larynx and um
without that it's it's it's um extremely

6978
02:26:40,070 --> 02:26:40,080
without that it's it's it's um extremely
 

6979
02:26:40,080 --> 02:26:43,790
without that it's it's it's um extremely
debilitating um and they're um yeah

6980
02:26:43,790 --> 02:26:43,800
debilitating um and they're um yeah
 

6981
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:45,469
debilitating um and they're um yeah
they're they're many many people that we

6982
02:26:45,469 --> 02:26:45,479
they're they're many many people that we
 

6983
02:26:45,479 --> 02:26:48,870
they're they're many many people that we
can help and I mean like especially if

6984
02:26:48,870 --> 02:26:48,880
can help and I mean like especially if
 

6985
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:50,830
can help and I mean like especially if
you start to kind of look at other forms

6986
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:50,840
you start to kind of look at other forms
 

6987
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:53,550
you start to kind of look at other forms
of movement disorders um that are not

6988
02:26:53,550 --> 02:26:53,560
of movement disorders um that are not
 

6989
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:56,110
of movement disorders um that are not
just from spinal cord injury but from uh

6990
02:26:56,110 --> 02:26:56,120
just from spinal cord injury but from uh
 

6991
02:26:56,120 --> 02:26:56,870
just from spinal cord injury but from uh
you know

6992
02:26:56,870 --> 02:26:56,880
you know
 

6993
02:26:56,880 --> 02:27:01,030
you know
ALS uh Ms or even stroke that that leads

6994
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:01,040
ALS uh Ms or even stroke that that leads
 

6995
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:03,510
ALS uh Ms or even stroke that that leads
you and or just just aging right that

6996
02:27:03,510 --> 02:27:03,520
you and or just just aging right that
 

6997
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:06,389
you and or just just aging right that
leads you to lose some of that Mobility

6998
02:27:06,389 --> 02:27:06,399
leads you to lose some of that Mobility
 

6999
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:08,230
leads you to lose some of that Mobility
that Independence it's uh extremely

7000
02:27:08,230 --> 02:27:08,240
that Independence it's uh extremely
 

7001
02:27:08,240 --> 02:27:10,190
that Independence it's uh extremely
debilitating and all of these are

7002
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:10,200
debilitating and all of these are
 

7003
02:27:10,200 --> 02:27:12,309
debilitating and all of these are
opportunities to help people to help

7004
02:27:12,309 --> 02:27:12,319
opportunities to help people to help
 

7005
02:27:12,319 --> 02:27:14,230
opportunities to help people to help
alleviate suffering to help improve the

7006
02:27:14,230 --> 02:27:14,240
alleviate suffering to help improve the
 

7007
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:16,030
alleviate suffering to help improve the
quality of life but each of the things

7008
02:27:16,030 --> 02:27:16,040
quality of life but each of the things
 

7009
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:18,469
quality of life but each of the things
you mentioned is its own little puzzle

7010
02:27:18,469 --> 02:27:18,479
you mentioned is its own little puzzle
 

7011
02:27:18,479 --> 02:27:22,269
you mentioned is its own little puzzle
then you uh to have increasing levels of

7012
02:27:22,269 --> 02:27:22,279
then you uh to have increasing levels of
 

7013
02:27:22,279 --> 02:27:23,870
then you uh to have increasing levels of
capability from a device like a neur

7014
02:27:23,870 --> 02:27:23,880
capability from a device like a neur
 

7015
02:27:23,880 --> 02:27:26,030
capability from a device like a neur
link device and so the first one you're

7016
02:27:26,030 --> 02:27:26,040
link device and so the first one you're
 

7017
02:27:26,040 --> 02:27:29,389
link device and so the first one you're
you're focusing on is uh it's just a

7018
02:27:29,389 --> 02:27:29,399
you're focusing on is uh it's just a
 

7019
02:27:29,399 --> 02:27:31,990
you're focusing on is uh it's just a
beautiful word telepathy so being able

7020
02:27:31,990 --> 02:27:32,000
beautiful word telepathy so being able
 

7021
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,870
beautiful word telepathy so being able
to communicate using your mind

7022
02:27:33,870 --> 02:27:33,880
to communicate using your mind
 

7023
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:36,389
to communicate using your mind
wirelessly with a digital device can you

7024
02:27:36,389 --> 02:27:36,399
wirelessly with a digital device can you
 

7025
02:27:36,399 --> 02:27:39,030
wirelessly with a digital device can you
just explain this exactly what we're

7026
02:27:39,030 --> 02:27:39,040
just explain this exactly what we're
 

7027
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:41,349
just explain this exactly what we're
talking about yeah I mean it's exactly

7028
02:27:41,349 --> 02:27:41,359
talking about yeah I mean it's exactly
 

7029
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:43,190
talking about yeah I mean it's exactly
that I mean I I think if you are able to

7030
02:27:43,190 --> 02:27:43,200
that I mean I I think if you are able to
 

7031
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:48,710
that I mean I I think if you are able to
control a uh cursor and able to click um

7032
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:48,720
control a uh cursor and able to click um
 

7033
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:51,150
control a uh cursor and able to click um
and be able to get access to computer or

7034
02:27:51,150 --> 02:27:51,160
and be able to get access to computer or
 

7035
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:53,710
and be able to get access to computer or
phone I mean the the whole world opens

7036
02:27:53,710 --> 02:27:53,720
phone I mean the the whole world opens
 

7037
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:58,030
phone I mean the the whole world opens
up to you and I mean I guess the word

7038
02:27:58,030 --> 02:27:58,040
up to you and I mean I guess the word
 

7039
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:00,429
up to you and I mean I guess the word
telepathy if you kind of think about

7040
02:28:00,429 --> 02:28:00,439
telepathy if you kind of think about
 

7041
02:28:00,439 --> 02:28:02,870
telepathy if you kind of think about
that as um you know just definitionally

7042
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:02,880
that as um you know just definitionally
 

7043
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:05,150
that as um you know just definitionally
being able to transfer information from

7044
02:28:05,150 --> 02:28:05,160
being able to transfer information from
 

7045
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:08,950
being able to transfer information from
my brain to your brain um without using

7046
02:28:08,950 --> 02:28:08,960
my brain to your brain um without using
 

7047
02:28:08,960 --> 02:28:11,510
my brain to your brain um without using
some of the the physical faculties that

7048
02:28:11,510 --> 02:28:11,520
some of the the physical faculties that
 

7049
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:14,070
some of the the physical faculties that
we have you know like voices but the

7050
02:28:14,070 --> 02:28:14,080
we have you know like voices but the
 

7051
02:28:14,080 --> 02:28:16,309
we have you know like voices but the
interesting thing here is I think the

7052
02:28:16,309 --> 02:28:16,319
interesting thing here is I think the
 

7053
02:28:16,319 --> 02:28:18,870
interesting thing here is I think the
thing that's not obviously clear is how

7054
02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:18,880
thing that's not obviously clear is how
 

7055
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:21,990
thing that's not obviously clear is how
exactly it works so in order to move a

7056
02:28:21,990 --> 02:28:22,000
exactly it works so in order to move a
 

7057
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,510
exactly it works so in order to move a
cursor

7058
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,520
cursor
 

7059
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:26,830
cursor
mhm there's uh at least a couple ways of

7060
02:28:26,830 --> 02:28:26,840
mhm there's uh at least a couple ways of
 

7061
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:29,950
mhm there's uh at least a couple ways of
doing that so one is you imagine

7062
02:28:29,950 --> 02:28:29,960
doing that so one is you imagine
 

7063
02:28:29,960 --> 02:28:33,070
doing that so one is you imagine
yourself maybe moving a mouse with your

7064
02:28:33,070 --> 02:28:33,080
yourself maybe moving a mouse with your
 

7065
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:37,070
yourself maybe moving a mouse with your
hand mhm or you can then which Nolan

7066
02:28:37,070 --> 02:28:37,080
hand mhm or you can then which Nolan
 

7067
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:40,429
hand mhm or you can then which Nolan
talked about like imagine moving the

7068
02:28:40,429 --> 02:28:40,439
talked about like imagine moving the
 

7069
02:28:40,439 --> 02:28:44,269
talked about like imagine moving the
cursor with your mind like I don't but

7070
02:28:44,269 --> 02:28:44,279
cursor with your mind like I don't but
 

7071
02:28:44,279 --> 02:28:46,469
cursor with your mind like I don't but
it's like there is a cognitive step here

7072
02:28:46,469 --> 02:28:46,479
it's like there is a cognitive step here
 

7073
02:28:46,479 --> 02:28:48,349
it's like there is a cognitive step here
that's fascinating cuz you you have to

7074
02:28:48,349 --> 02:28:48,359
that's fascinating cuz you you have to
 

7075
02:28:48,359 --> 02:28:50,150
that's fascinating cuz you you have to
use the brain and you have to learn how

7076
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:50,160
use the brain and you have to learn how
 

7077
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:52,070
use the brain and you have to learn how
to use the brain mhm and you kind of

7078
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:52,080
to use the brain mhm and you kind of
 

7079
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:55,389
to use the brain mhm and you kind of
have to figure it out dynamically like

7080
02:28:55,389 --> 02:28:55,399
have to figure it out dynamically like
 

7081
02:28:55,399 --> 02:28:57,910
have to figure it out dynamically like
uh because you reward yourself if it

7082
02:28:57,910 --> 02:28:57,920
uh because you reward yourself if it
 

7083
02:28:57,920 --> 02:28:59,870
uh because you reward yourself if it
works so you're like I mean there's a

7084
02:28:59,870 --> 02:28:59,880
works so you're like I mean there's a
 

7085
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:01,630
works so you're like I mean there's a
step that this is it's just a

7086
02:29:01,630 --> 02:29:01,640
step that this is it's just a
 

7087
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:03,190
step that this is it's just a
fascinating step because you have to get

7088
02:29:03,190 --> 02:29:03,200
fascinating step because you have to get
 

7089
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:05,510
fascinating step because you have to get
the brain to start firing in the right

7090
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:05,520
the brain to start firing in the right
 

7091
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:09,349
the brain to start firing in the right
way yeah and you do that by

7092
02:29:09,349 --> 02:29:09,359
way yeah and you do that by
 

7093
02:29:09,359 --> 02:29:11,870
way yeah and you do that by
imagining uh like fake it till you make

7094
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:11,880
imagining uh like fake it till you make
 

7095
02:29:11,880 --> 02:29:14,630
imagining uh like fake it till you make
it and all of a sudden it creates the

7096
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:14,640
it and all of a sudden it creates the
 

7097
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:17,110
it and all of a sudden it creates the
right kind of signal that if decoded

7098
02:29:17,110 --> 02:29:17,120
right kind of signal that if decoded
 

7099
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:19,630
right kind of signal that if decoded
correctly uh can create the kind of

7100
02:29:19,630 --> 02:29:19,640
correctly uh can create the kind of
 

7101
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:21,110
correctly uh can create the kind of
effect and then there's like noise

7102
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:21,120
effect and then there's like noise
 

7103
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,469
effect and then there's like noise
around that you have to figure all of

7104
02:29:22,469 --> 02:29:22,479
around that you have to figure all of
 

7105
02:29:22,479 --> 02:29:25,190
around that you have to figure all of
that out but on the Human Side imagine

7106
02:29:25,190 --> 02:29:25,200
that out but on the Human Side imagine
 

7107
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:27,469
that out but on the Human Side imagine
the cursor moving is what you have to do

7108
02:29:27,469 --> 02:29:27,479
the cursor moving is what you have to do
 

7109
02:29:27,479 --> 02:29:29,750
the cursor moving is what you have to do
yeah he says using the force the

7110
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:29,760
yeah he says using the force the
 

7111
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:32,469
yeah he says using the force the
force I mean that's isn't that just like

7112
02:29:32,469 --> 02:29:32,479
force I mean that's isn't that just like
 

7113
02:29:32,479 --> 02:29:35,110
force I mean that's isn't that just like
fascinating to you that it works like to

7114
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:35,120
fascinating to you that it works like to
 

7115
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:37,950
fascinating to you that it works like to
me it's like holy that actually

7116
02:29:37,950 --> 02:29:37,960
me it's like holy that actually
 

7117
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:40,429
me it's like holy that actually
works like you could move a cursor with

7118
02:29:40,429 --> 02:29:40,439
works like you could move a cursor with
 

7119
02:29:40,439 --> 02:29:43,070
works like you could move a cursor with
your mind you know as much as

7120
02:29:43,070 --> 02:29:43,080
your mind you know as much as
 

7121
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:45,910
your mind you know as much as
you're learning to use that thing that

7122
02:29:45,910 --> 02:29:45,920
you're learning to use that thing that
 

7123
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:48,590
you're learning to use that thing that
thing's also learning about you like our

7124
02:29:48,590 --> 02:29:48,600
thing's also learning about you like our
 

7125
02:29:48,600 --> 02:29:50,550
thing's also learning about you like our
our model is constantly up updating the

7126
02:29:50,550 --> 02:29:50,560
our model is constantly up updating the
 

7127
02:29:50,560 --> 02:29:53,590
our model is constantly up updating the
weights to say oh if if someone is

7128
02:29:53,590 --> 02:29:53,600
weights to say oh if if someone is
 

7129
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,710
weights to say oh if if someone is
thinking about you know this

7130
02:29:56,710 --> 02:29:56,720
thinking about you know this
 

7131
02:29:56,720 --> 02:29:59,469
thinking about you know this
sophisticated forms of like spiking

7132
02:29:59,469 --> 02:29:59,479
sophisticated forms of like spiking
 

7133
02:29:59,479 --> 02:30:01,469
sophisticated forms of like spiking
patterns like that actually means to do

7134
02:30:01,469 --> 02:30:01,479
patterns like that actually means to do
 

7135
02:30:01,479 --> 02:30:03,389
patterns like that actually means to do
this right so the the machine is

7136
02:30:03,389 --> 02:30:03,399
this right so the the machine is
 

7137
02:30:03,399 --> 02:30:04,710
this right so the the machine is
learning about the human and the human

7138
02:30:04,710 --> 02:30:04,720
learning about the human and the human
 

7139
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,389
learning about the human and the human
is learning about the machine so there's

7140
02:30:06,389 --> 02:30:06,399
is learning about the machine so there's
 

7141
02:30:06,399 --> 02:30:08,750
is learning about the machine so there's
a adaptability to the signal processing

7142
02:30:08,750 --> 02:30:08,760
a adaptability to the signal processing
 

7143
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:11,710
a adaptability to the signal processing
the decoding step and then there's the

7144
02:30:11,710 --> 02:30:11,720
the decoding step and then there's the
 

7145
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:15,349
the decoding step and then there's the
adaptation of noan the human being like

7146
02:30:15,349 --> 02:30:15,359
adaptation of noan the human being like
 

7147
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:17,110
adaptation of noan the human being like
the same way if if you give me a new

7148
02:30:17,110 --> 02:30:17,120
the same way if if you give me a new
 

7149
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:20,349
the same way if if you give me a new
mouse and I move it I learn very quickly

7150
02:30:20,349 --> 02:30:20,359
mouse and I move it I learn very quickly
 

7151
02:30:20,359 --> 02:30:21,990
mouse and I move it I learn very quickly
about its sensitivity so I learned to

7152
02:30:21,990 --> 02:30:22,000
about its sensitivity so I learned to
 

7153
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:27,070
about its sensitivity so I learned to
move it slower mhm and then there's

7154
02:30:27,070 --> 02:30:27,080
move it slower mhm and then there's
 

7155
02:30:27,080 --> 02:30:29,030
move it slower mhm and then there's
other kind of signal drift and all that

7156
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,040
other kind of signal drift and all that
 

7157
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,070
other kind of signal drift and all that
kind of stuff they have to adapt to so

7158
02:30:31,070 --> 02:30:31,080
kind of stuff they have to adapt to so
 

7159
02:30:31,080 --> 02:30:33,870
kind of stuff they have to adapt to so
both are adapting to each other

7160
02:30:33,870 --> 02:30:33,880
both are adapting to each other
 

7161
02:30:33,880 --> 02:30:36,510
both are adapting to each other
correct that's a fascinating like

7162
02:30:36,510 --> 02:30:36,520
correct that's a fascinating like
 

7163
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:38,510
correct that's a fascinating like
software Challenge on both sides the

7164
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:38,520
software Challenge on both sides the
 

7165
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:40,429
software Challenge on both sides the
software on both on the the human

7166
02:30:40,429 --> 02:30:40,439
software on both on the the human
 

7167
02:30:40,439 --> 02:30:42,870
software on both on the the human
software and organic and the inorganic

7168
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:42,880
software and organic and the inorganic
 

7169
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:45,830
software and organic and the inorganic
the organic and the inorganic anyway so

7170
02:30:45,830 --> 02:30:45,840
the organic and the inorganic anyway so
 

7171
02:30:45,840 --> 02:30:48,030
the organic and the inorganic anyway so
sorry to rudely interrupt so there's a

7172
02:30:48,030 --> 02:30:48,040
sorry to rudely interrupt so there's a
 

7173
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:50,469
sorry to rudely interrupt so there's a
selection that Nolan has pass with

7174
02:30:50,469 --> 02:30:50,479
selection that Nolan has pass with
 

7175
02:30:50,479 --> 02:30:54,790
selection that Nolan has pass with
flying colors um so everything including

7176
02:30:54,790 --> 02:30:54,800
flying colors um so everything including
 

7177
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:57,630
flying colors um so everything including
that it's a BCI friendly home all of

7178
02:30:57,630 --> 02:30:57,640
that it's a BCI friendly home all of
 

7179
02:30:57,640 --> 02:31:00,349
that it's a BCI friendly home all of
that so what is the the process of the

7180
02:31:00,349 --> 02:31:00,359
that so what is the the process of the
 

7181
02:31:00,359 --> 02:31:02,790
that so what is the the process of the
surgery the implantation the first

7182
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:02,800
surgery the implantation the first
 

7183
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:06,110
surgery the implantation the first
moment when he gets to use the system

7184
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:06,120
moment when he gets to use the system
 

7185
02:31:06,120 --> 02:31:07,950
moment when he gets to use the system
the end to end uh you know we say

7186
02:31:07,950 --> 02:31:07,960
the end to end uh you know we say
 

7187
02:31:07,960 --> 02:31:10,349
the end to end uh you know we say
patient in to Patient out is anywhere

7188
02:31:10,349 --> 02:31:10,359
patient in to Patient out is anywhere
 

7189
02:31:10,359 --> 02:31:13,469
patient in to Patient out is anywhere
between 2 to four hours uh in particular

7190
02:31:13,469 --> 02:31:13,479
between 2 to four hours uh in particular
 

7191
02:31:13,479 --> 02:31:14,950
between 2 to four hours uh in particular
case for n and it was about 3 and 1/

7192
02:31:14,950 --> 02:31:14,960
case for n and it was about 3 and 1/
 

7193
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:17,230
case for n and it was about 3 and 1/
half hours and there's many steps

7194
02:31:17,230 --> 02:31:17,240
half hours and there's many steps
 

7195
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:19,469
half hours and there's many steps
leading to you know the actual robot

7196
02:31:19,469 --> 02:31:19,479
leading to you know the actual robot
 

7197
02:31:19,479 --> 02:31:22,030
leading to you know the actual robot
insertion right so there's anesthesia

7198
02:31:22,030 --> 02:31:22,040
insertion right so there's anesthesia
 

7199
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:26,110
insertion right so there's anesthesia
induction and we do intraop CT Imaging

7200
02:31:26,110 --> 02:31:26,120
induction and we do intraop CT Imaging
 

7201
02:31:26,120 --> 02:31:27,990
induction and we do intraop CT Imaging
to make sure that we're you know

7202
02:31:27,990 --> 02:31:28,000
to make sure that we're you know
 

7203
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,990
to make sure that we're you know
drilling the hole in the right location

7204
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:30,000
drilling the hole in the right location
 

7205
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,429
drilling the hole in the right location
and this is also pre-planned beforehand

7206
02:31:32,429 --> 02:31:32,439
and this is also pre-planned beforehand
 

7207
02:31:32,439 --> 02:31:34,910
and this is also pre-planned beforehand
um uh someone goes through someone like

7208
02:31:34,910 --> 02:31:34,920
um uh someone goes through someone like
 

7209
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:38,030
um uh someone goes through someone like
Nolan would go through fmri and then um

7210
02:31:38,030 --> 02:31:38,040
Nolan would go through fmri and then um
 

7211
02:31:38,040 --> 02:31:40,309
Nolan would go through fmri and then um
they can think about W wiggling their

7212
02:31:40,309 --> 02:31:40,319
they can think about W wiggling their
 

7213
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:41,790
they can think about W wiggling their
hand you know obviously due to their

7214
02:31:41,790 --> 02:31:41,800
hand you know obviously due to their
 

7215
02:31:41,800 --> 02:31:43,790
hand you know obviously due to their
injury it's not going to actually lead

7216
02:31:43,790 --> 02:31:43,800
injury it's not going to actually lead
 

7217
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:47,550
injury it's not going to actually lead
to um any any sort of intended output

7218
02:31:47,550 --> 02:31:47,560
to um any any sort of intended output
 

7219
02:31:47,560 --> 02:31:50,070
to um any any sort of intended output
but it's the same part of the brain that

7220
02:31:50,070 --> 02:31:50,080
but it's the same part of the brain that
 

7221
02:31:50,080 --> 02:31:52,070
but it's the same part of the brain that
lights up when you're imagining moving

7222
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:52,080
lights up when you're imagining moving
 

7223
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:53,790
lights up when you're imagining moving
your finger to actually moving your

7224
02:31:53,790 --> 02:31:53,800
your finger to actually moving your
 

7225
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:55,790
your finger to actually moving your
finger and that's one of the ways in

7226
02:31:55,790 --> 02:31:55,800
finger and that's one of the ways in
 

7227
02:31:55,800 --> 02:31:58,750
finger and that's one of the ways in
which we can actually know where to

7228
02:31:58,750 --> 02:31:58,760
which we can actually know where to
 

7229
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:00,910
which we can actually know where to
place our threads um because we want to

7230
02:32:00,910 --> 02:32:00,920
place our threads um because we want to
 

7231
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:02,990
place our threads um because we want to
go into What's called the hand knob area

7232
02:32:02,990 --> 02:32:03,000
go into What's called the hand knob area
 

7233
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:06,150
go into What's called the hand knob area
in the motal cortex and you know as as

7234
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:06,160
in the motal cortex and you know as as
 

7235
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:09,309
in the motal cortex and you know as as
much as possible densely put our Electro

7236
02:32:09,309 --> 02:32:09,319
much as possible densely put our Electro
 

7237
02:32:09,319 --> 02:32:10,950
much as possible densely put our Electro
threads

7238
02:32:10,950 --> 02:32:10,960
threads
 

7239
02:32:10,960 --> 02:32:14,630
threads
um so yeah we do intraop CT Imaging to

7240
02:32:14,630 --> 02:32:14,640
um so yeah we do intraop CT Imaging to
 

7241
02:32:14,640 --> 02:32:16,750
um so yeah we do intraop CT Imaging to
make sure and double check the location

7242
02:32:16,750 --> 02:32:16,760
make sure and double check the location
 

7243
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:17,550
make sure and double check the location
of the

7244
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:17,560
of the
 

7245
02:32:17,560 --> 02:32:22,070
of the
craniectomy and um surgeon comes in does

7246
02:32:22,070 --> 02:32:22,080
craniectomy and um surgeon comes in does
 

7247
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:25,550
craniectomy and um surgeon comes in does
their thing in terms of like skin uh

7248
02:32:25,550 --> 02:32:25,560
their thing in terms of like skin uh
 

7249
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:28,150
their thing in terms of like skin uh
incision craniectomy so drilling of the

7250
02:32:28,150 --> 02:32:28,160
incision craniectomy so drilling of the
 

7251
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,630
incision craniectomy so drilling of the
skull and then there's many different

7252
02:32:29,630 --> 02:32:29,640
skull and then there's many different
 

7253
02:32:29,640 --> 02:32:31,110
skull and then there's many different
layers of the brain uh there's What's

7254
02:32:31,110 --> 02:32:31,120
layers of the brain uh there's What's
 

7255
02:32:31,120 --> 02:32:33,349
layers of the brain uh there's What's
called the dura which is a very very

7256
02:32:33,349 --> 02:32:33,359
called the dura which is a very very
 

7257
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:36,070
called the dura which is a very very
thick layer that surrounds the brain

7258
02:32:36,070 --> 02:32:36,080
thick layer that surrounds the brain
 

7259
02:32:36,080 --> 02:32:38,190
thick layer that surrounds the brain
that gets actually reective in a process

7260
02:32:38,190 --> 02:32:38,200
that gets actually reective in a process
 

7261
02:32:38,200 --> 02:32:41,750
that gets actually reective in a process
called dctom and that then expose the pi

7262
02:32:41,750 --> 02:32:41,760
called dctom and that then expose the pi
 

7263
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:43,910
called dctom and that then expose the pi
and the brain that you want to insert

7264
02:32:43,910 --> 02:32:43,920
and the brain that you want to insert
 

7265
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:45,750
and the brain that you want to insert
and by the time it's been around

7266
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:45,760
and by the time it's been around
 

7267
02:32:45,760 --> 02:32:47,950
and by the time it's been around
anywhere between 1 to 1 and a half hours

7268
02:32:47,950 --> 02:32:47,960
anywhere between 1 to 1 and a half hours
 

7269
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:49,830
anywhere between 1 to 1 and a half hours
robot comes in does this thing play

7270
02:32:49,830 --> 02:32:49,840
robot comes in does this thing play
 

7271
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,550
robot comes in does this thing play
placement of the targets inserting of

7272
02:32:51,550 --> 02:32:51,560
placement of the targets inserting of
 

7273
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:53,870
placement of the targets inserting of
the thread that takes anywhere between

7274
02:32:53,870 --> 02:32:53,880
the thread that takes anywhere between
 

7275
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:55,630
the thread that takes anywhere between
20 to 40 minutes in the particular case

7276
02:32:55,630 --> 02:32:55,640
20 to 40 minutes in the particular case
 

7277
02:32:55,640 --> 02:32:57,870
20 to 40 minutes in the particular case
for Nolan was just under or just over 30

7278
02:32:57,870 --> 02:32:57,880
for Nolan was just under or just over 30
 

7279
02:32:57,880 --> 02:33:00,670
for Nolan was just under or just over 30
minutes and then after that the surgeon

7280
02:33:00,670 --> 02:33:00,680
minutes and then after that the surgeon
 

7281
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:02,590
minutes and then after that the surgeon
comes in there's a couple other steps of

7282
02:33:02,590 --> 02:33:02,600
comes in there's a couple other steps of
 

7283
02:33:02,600 --> 02:33:04,190
comes in there's a couple other steps of
like actually inserting the Dural

7284
02:33:04,190 --> 02:33:04,200
like actually inserting the Dural
 

7285
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:06,269
like actually inserting the Dural
substitute layer um to protect the

7286
02:33:06,269 --> 02:33:06,279
substitute layer um to protect the
 

7287
02:33:06,279 --> 02:33:09,469
substitute layer um to protect the
thread as well as the the brain and then

7288
02:33:09,469 --> 02:33:09,479
thread as well as the the brain and then
 

7289
02:33:09,479 --> 02:33:12,349
thread as well as the the brain and then
um yeah screw screw in the implant and

7290
02:33:12,349 --> 02:33:12,359
um yeah screw screw in the implant and
 

7291
02:33:12,359 --> 02:33:15,630
um yeah screw screw in the implant and
then skin flap and then suture and then

7292
02:33:15,630 --> 02:33:15,640
then skin flap and then suture and then
 

7293
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:17,389
then skin flap and then suture and then
you're

7294
02:33:17,389 --> 02:33:17,399
you're
 

7295
02:33:17,399 --> 02:33:21,830
you're
out so uh where when uh Nolan woke

7296
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:21,840
out so uh where when uh Nolan woke
 

7297
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:23,910
out so uh where when uh Nolan woke
up what was that like what was the

7298
02:33:23,910 --> 02:33:23,920
up what was that like what was the
 

7299
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:25,710
up what was that like what was the
recovery like and when was the first

7300
02:33:25,710 --> 02:33:25,720
recovery like and when was the first
 

7301
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:28,349
recovery like and when was the first
time he was able to use it so he was

7302
02:33:28,349 --> 02:33:28,359
time he was able to use it so he was
 

7303
02:33:28,359 --> 02:33:30,990
time he was able to use it so he was
actually immediately after the surgery

7304
02:33:30,990 --> 02:33:31,000
actually immediately after the surgery
 

7305
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,309
actually immediately after the surgery
um you know like an hour after the

7306
02:33:33,309 --> 02:33:33,319
um you know like an hour after the
 

7307
02:33:33,319 --> 02:33:36,550
um you know like an hour after the
surgery as he was waking up um we did

7308
02:33:36,550 --> 02:33:36,560
surgery as he was waking up um we did
 

7309
02:33:36,560 --> 02:33:38,670
surgery as he was waking up um we did
turn on the device um make sure that we

7310
02:33:38,670 --> 02:33:38,680
turn on the device um make sure that we
 

7311
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:40,830
turn on the device um make sure that we
are recording neural signals and we

7312
02:33:40,830 --> 02:33:40,840
are recording neural signals and we
 

7313
02:33:40,840 --> 02:33:43,630
are recording neural signals and we
actually did have uh couple signals that

7314
02:33:43,630 --> 02:33:43,640
actually did have uh couple signals that
 

7315
02:33:43,640 --> 02:33:45,990
actually did have uh couple signals that
we um noticed that he can actually

7316
02:33:45,990 --> 02:33:46,000
we um noticed that he can actually
 

7317
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,030
we um noticed that he can actually
modulate and what I mean by modulate is

7318
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:48,040
modulate and what I mean by modulate is
 

7319
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:49,990
modulate and what I mean by modulate is
that he can think about crunching his

7320
02:33:49,990 --> 02:33:50,000
that he can think about crunching his
 

7321
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,389
that he can think about crunching his
fist and you could see the spike

7322
02:33:53,389 --> 02:33:53,399
fist and you could see the spike
 

7323
02:33:53,399 --> 02:33:55,910
fist and you could see the spike
disappear and

7324
02:33:55,910 --> 02:33:55,920
disappear and
 

7325
02:33:55,920 --> 02:33:58,710
disappear and
appear that's awesome um and that was

7326
02:33:58,710 --> 02:33:58,720
appear that's awesome um and that was
 

7327
02:33:58,720 --> 02:34:01,429
appear that's awesome um and that was
immediate right uh immediate uh after in

7328
02:34:01,429 --> 02:34:01,439
immediate right uh immediate uh after in
 

7329
02:34:01,439 --> 02:34:04,590
immediate right uh immediate uh after in
in the recovery room how cool is

7330
02:34:04,590 --> 02:34:04,600
in the recovery room how cool is
 

7331
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:07,710
in the recovery room how cool is
that yeah that's a human being I mean

7332
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:07,720
that yeah that's a human being I mean
 

7333
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:09,710
that yeah that's a human being I mean
what that feel like for

7334
02:34:09,710 --> 02:34:09,720
what that feel like for
 

7335
02:34:09,720 --> 02:34:12,630
what that feel like for
you this device and a human being a

7336
02:34:12,630 --> 02:34:12,640
you this device and a human being a
 

7337
02:34:12,640 --> 02:34:15,750
you this device and a human being a
first step of a gigantic journey I mean

7338
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:15,760
first step of a gigantic journey I mean
 

7339
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:18,030
first step of a gigantic journey I mean
it's a historic moment even just that

7340
02:34:18,030 --> 02:34:18,040
it's a historic moment even just that
 

7341
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:21,389
it's a historic moment even just that
Spike just to be able to to modulate

7342
02:34:21,389 --> 02:34:21,399
Spike just to be able to to modulate
 

7343
02:34:21,399 --> 02:34:23,710
Spike just to be able to to modulate
that you know obviously there have been

7344
02:34:23,710 --> 02:34:23,720
that you know obviously there have been
 

7345
02:34:23,720 --> 02:34:26,389
that you know obviously there have been
other other you know uh as you mentioned

7346
02:34:26,389 --> 02:34:26,399
other other you know uh as you mentioned
 

7347
02:34:26,399 --> 02:34:29,230
other other you know uh as you mentioned
Pioneers that have participated in these

7348
02:34:29,230 --> 02:34:29,240
Pioneers that have participated in these
 

7349
02:34:29,240 --> 02:34:30,870
Pioneers that have participated in these
groundbreaking

7350
02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:30,880
groundbreaking
 

7351
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:35,230
groundbreaking
BCI um you know uh investigational early

7352
02:34:35,230 --> 02:34:35,240
BCI um you know uh investigational early
 

7353
02:34:35,240 --> 02:34:38,349
BCI um you know uh investigational early
feasibility studies so we're obviously

7354
02:34:38,349 --> 02:34:38,359
feasibility studies so we're obviously
 

7355
02:34:38,359 --> 02:34:39,710
feasibility studies so we're obviously
standing in the shoulders of the Giants

7356
02:34:39,710 --> 02:34:39,720
standing in the shoulders of the Giants
 

7357
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:41,150
standing in the shoulders of the Giants
here you know we're not the first ones

7358
02:34:41,150 --> 02:34:41,160
here you know we're not the first ones
 

7359
02:34:41,160 --> 02:34:42,950
here you know we're not the first ones
to actually put electrod in a human

7360
02:34:42,950 --> 02:34:42,960
to actually put electrod in a human
 

7361
02:34:42,960 --> 02:34:46,910
to actually put electrod in a human
human brain um but I I mean just leading

7362
02:34:46,910 --> 02:34:46,920
human brain um but I I mean just leading
 

7363
02:34:46,920 --> 02:34:49,190
human brain um but I I mean just leading
up to the surgery there was uh I I I

7364
02:34:49,190 --> 02:34:49,200
up to the surgery there was uh I I I
 

7365
02:34:49,200 --> 02:34:51,790
up to the surgery there was uh I I I
definitely not sleep I there's just it's

7366
02:34:51,790 --> 02:34:51,800
definitely not sleep I there's just it's
 

7367
02:34:51,800 --> 02:34:53,670
definitely not sleep I there's just it's
the first time that you're working in a

7368
02:34:53,670 --> 02:34:53,680
the first time that you're working in a
 

7369
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:57,429
the first time that you're working in a
completely new environment um we had a

7370
02:34:57,429 --> 02:34:57,439
completely new environment um we had a
 

7371
02:34:57,439 --> 02:35:00,309
completely new environment um we had a
lot of confidence based on our benchtop

7372
02:35:00,309 --> 02:35:00,319
lot of confidence based on our benchtop
 

7373
02:35:00,319 --> 02:35:03,910
lot of confidence based on our benchtop
testing uh or pre-clinical R&D studies

7374
02:35:03,910 --> 02:35:03,920
testing uh or pre-clinical R&D studies
 

7375
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:07,190
testing uh or pre-clinical R&D studies
that the mechanism the threads the

7376
02:35:07,190 --> 02:35:07,200
that the mechanism the threads the
 

7377
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:10,030
that the mechanism the threads the
insertion all that stuff is is very safe

7378
02:35:10,030 --> 02:35:10,040
insertion all that stuff is is very safe
 

7379
02:35:10,040 --> 02:35:13,950
insertion all that stuff is is very safe
and that it's um uh you obviously ready

7380
02:35:13,950 --> 02:35:13,960
and that it's um uh you obviously ready
 

7381
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:16,150
and that it's um uh you obviously ready
for uh doing this in a human but there's

7382
02:35:16,150 --> 02:35:16,160
for uh doing this in a human but there's
 

7383
02:35:16,160 --> 02:35:20,110
for uh doing this in a human but there's
still a lot of unknown Unknown about can

7384
02:35:20,110 --> 02:35:20,120
still a lot of unknown Unknown about can
 

7385
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:23,510
still a lot of unknown Unknown about can
the needle actually insert uh I mean I

7386
02:35:23,510 --> 02:35:23,520
the needle actually insert uh I mean I
 

7387
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:26,389
the needle actually insert uh I mean I
we brought something like 40 needles

7388
02:35:26,389 --> 02:35:26,399
we brought something like 40 needles
 

7389
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:27,870
we brought something like 40 needles
just in case they break and we ended up

7390
02:35:27,870 --> 02:35:27,880
just in case they break and we ended up
 

7391
02:35:27,880 --> 02:35:29,710
just in case they break and we ended up
using only one um but I mean that that

7392
02:35:29,710 --> 02:35:29,720
using only one um but I mean that that
 

7393
02:35:29,720 --> 02:35:31,830
using only one um but I mean that that
was a level of just complete unknown

7394
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:31,840
was a level of just complete unknown
 

7395
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,349
was a level of just complete unknown
right because it's a very very different

7396
02:35:33,349 --> 02:35:33,359
right because it's a very very different
 

7397
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:35,630
right because it's a very very different
environment and uh I mean that's that's

7398
02:35:35,630 --> 02:35:35,640
environment and uh I mean that's that's
 

7399
02:35:35,640 --> 02:35:37,550
environment and uh I mean that's that's
why we do clinical trial in the first

7400
02:35:37,550 --> 02:35:37,560
why we do clinical trial in the first
 

7401
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:39,870
why we do clinical trial in the first
place to be able to test these things

7402
02:35:39,870 --> 02:35:39,880
place to be able to test these things
 

7403
02:35:39,880 --> 02:35:43,790
place to be able to test these things
out so extreme nervousness and uh just

7404
02:35:43,790 --> 02:35:43,800
out so extreme nervousness and uh just
 

7405

just I many many sleepless night leading
up to the surgery and and definitely the

7408
02:35:48,670 --> 02:35:48,680
up to the surgery and and definitely the
 

7409
02:35:48,680 --> 02:35:49,950
up to the surgery and and definitely the
day before the surgery and it was an

7410
02:35:49,950 --> 02:35:49,960
day before the surgery and it was an
 

7411
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:51,670
day before the surgery and it was an
early morning surgery like we we started

7412
02:35:51,670 --> 02:35:51,680
early morning surgery like we we started
 

7413

needs to happen next uh what a set of
 

7471
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:11,670
needs to happen next uh what a set of
sequences of events that needs to happen

7472
02:37:11,670 --> 02:37:11,680
sequences of events that needs to happen
 

7473
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:13,630
sequences of events that needs to happen
for us to you know make it worthwhile

7474
02:37:13,630 --> 02:37:13,640
for us to you know make it worthwhile
 

7475
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:16,990
for us to you know make it worthwhile
for um uh you know both Nolan as well as

02:37:32,110 --> 02:37:32,120
really exciting to see there's um that's
 

7487
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:35,790
really exciting to see there's um that's
a source of hope this first big

7488
02:37:35,790 --> 02:37:35,800
a source of hope this first big
 

7489
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:38,870
a source of hope this first big
step opportunity to help hundreds of

7490
02:37:38,870 --> 02:37:38,880
step opportunity to help hundreds of
 

7491
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:42,990
step opportunity to help hundreds of
thousands of people and then maybe uh

7492
02:37:42,990 --> 02:37:43,000
thousands of people and then maybe uh
 

7493
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,670
thousands of people and then maybe uh
expand the realm of the possible for the

7494
02:37:45,670 --> 02:37:45,680
expand the realm of the possible for the
 

7495
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:47,630
expand the realm of the possible for the
human mind for millions of people in the

7496
02:37:47,630 --> 02:37:47,640
human mind for millions of people in the
 

7497
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:50,349
human mind for millions of people in the
future so it's it's really exciting so

7498
02:37:50,349 --> 02:37:50,359
future so it's it's really exciting so
 

7499
02:37:50,359 --> 02:37:51,790
future so it's it's really exciting so
like the the

7500

like the the
 

7501
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:53,990
like the the
opportunities are all ahead of us and to

7502
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:54,000
opportunities are all ahead of us and to
 

7503
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,510
opportunities are all ahead of us and to
do that safely and to do that

7504
02:37:55,510 --> 02:37:55,520
do that safely and to do that
 

7505
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:58,389
do that safely and to do that
effectively was uh was really fun to see

7506
02:37:58,389 --> 02:37:58,399
effectively was uh was really fun to see
 

7507
02:37:58,399 --> 02:38:00,269
effectively was uh was really fun to see
as an engineer just watching other

7545
02:38:39,640 --> 02:38:42,030
second dropped at first but then
eventually was regained and that the

7546
02:38:42,030 --> 02:38:42,040
eventually was regained and that the
 

7547
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:43,710

whole story of how it was regained is

7548
02:38:43,710 --> 02:38:43,720
whole story of how it was regained is
 

7549
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:45,870
whole story of how it was regained is
super interesting that's definitely

7550
02:38:45,870 --> 02:38:45,880
super interesting that's definitely
 

7551
02:38:45,880 --> 02:38:47,630

something I'll talk to uh to Bliss and

7552
02:38:47,630 --> 02:38:47,640
something I'll talk to uh to Bliss and
 

7553
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:52,070
something I'll talk to uh to Bliss and
to Nolan about um but in general um can

7554
02:38:52,070 --> 02:38:52,080
to Nolan about um but in general um can
 

7555
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:54,230
to Nolan about um but in general um can
you speak to this whole experience how

7556
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:54,240
you speak to this whole experience how
 

7557
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:57,950
you speak to this whole experience how
is the performance regained and

7558
02:38:57,950 --> 02:38:57,960
is the performance regained and
 

7559
02:38:57,960 --> 02:39:01,309
is the performance regained and
um just the the technical aspects of uh

7560
02:39:01,309 --> 02:39:01,319
um just the the technical aspects of uh
 

7561
02:39:01,319 --> 02:39:03,630
um just the the technical aspects of uh
the threads being retracted and moving

02:39:03,640 --> 02:39:06,389
the threads being retracted and moving
the main takeaway is that in the end the

7564
02:39:06,389 --> 02:39:06,399
the main takeaway is that in the end the
 

7565
02:39:06,399 --> 02:39:08,389
the main takeaway is that in the end the
performance have come back and it's

7566
02:39:08,389 --> 02:39:08,399
performance have come back and it's
 

7567
02:39:08,399 --> 02:39:10,110
performance have come back and it's
actually gotten better than it was

7568
02:39:10,110 --> 02:39:10,120
actually gotten better than it was
 

7569
02:39:10,120 --> 02:39:13,070
actually gotten better than it was
before um he's actually just beat the

7570
02:39:13,070 --> 02:39:13,080
before um he's actually just beat the
 

7571
02:39:13,080 --> 02:39:16,990
before um he's actually just beat the
world record yet again last week um to

7572
02:39:16,990 --> 02:39:17,000
world record yet again last week um to
 

7573
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,349
world record yet again last week um to
8.5 BPS so I mean he's he's just

7574
02:39:19,349 --> 02:39:19,359
8.5 BPS so I mean he's he's just
 

7575
02:39:19,359 --> 02:39:20,750
8.5 BPS so I mean he's he's just
cranking and he's just improving the

7576
02:39:20,750 --> 02:39:20,760
cranking and he's just improving the
 

7577
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:23,070
cranking and he's just improving the
previous one was that he set was eight

7578
02:39:23,070 --> 02:39:23,080
previous one was that he set was eight
 

7579
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:25,269
previous one was that he set was eight
correct he said 8.5 yeah the previous

7580
02:39:25,269 --> 02:39:25,279
correct he said 8.5 yeah the previous
 

7581
02:39:25,279 --> 02:39:28,870
correct he said 8.5 yeah the previous
world record uh in human was 4.6 yeah so

7582
02:39:28,870 --> 02:39:28,880
world record uh in human was 4.6 yeah so
 

7583
02:39:28,880 --> 02:39:31,389
world record uh in human was 4.6 yeah so
it's uh almost double yeah and his goal

7584
02:39:31,389 --> 02:39:31,399
it's uh almost double yeah and his goal
 

7585
02:39:31,399 --> 02:39:34,110
it's uh almost double yeah and his goal
is to try to get to 10 which is rough

7586
02:39:34,110 --> 02:39:34,120
is to try to get to 10 which is rough
 

7587
02:39:34,120 --> 02:39:36,110
is to try to get to 10 which is rough
roughly around kind of the median neural

7588
02:39:36,110 --> 02:39:36,120
roughly around kind of the median neural
 

7589
02:39:36,120 --> 02:39:39,389
roughly around kind of the median neural

7591
02:39:39,399 --> 02:39:42,269
Linker uh using a a you know Mouse with
the hand so it's um it's getting there

7592
02:39:42,269 --> 02:39:42,279
the hand so it's um it's getting there
 

7593
02:39:42,279 --> 02:39:44,309
the hand so it's um it's getting there
so yeah so the the performance was

7594
02:39:44,309 --> 02:39:44,319
so yeah so the the performance was
 

7595
02:39:44,319 --> 02:39:47,269
so yeah so the the performance was
regained yeah better than before so that

7596
02:39:47,269 --> 02:39:47,279
regained yeah better than before so that
 

7597
02:39:47,279 --> 02:39:50,870
regained yeah better than before so that
that's you know a a story on its own of

7598
02:39:50,870 --> 02:39:50,880
that's you know a a story on its own of
 

7599
02:39:50,880 --> 02:39:54,190
that's you know a a story on its own of
what took the BCI team to recover that

7600
02:39:54,190 --> 02:39:54,200
what took the BCI team to recover that
 

7601
02:39:54,200 --> 02:39:55,950
what took the BCI team to recover that
performance it was it was actually

7602
02:39:55,950 --> 02:39:55,960
performance it was it was actually
 

7603
02:39:55,960 --> 02:39:57,910
performance it was it was actually
mostly on kind of the signal processing

7604
02:39:57,910 --> 02:39:57,920
mostly on kind of the signal processing
 

7605
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:00,429
mostly on kind of the signal processing
and so you know as I mentioned we were

7606
02:40:00,429 --> 02:40:00,439
and so you know as I mentioned we were
 

7607
02:40:00,439 --> 02:40:02,150
and so you know as I mentioned we were
um kind of looking at these Spike

7608
02:40:02,150 --> 02:40:02,160
um kind of looking at these Spike
 

7609
02:40:02,160 --> 02:40:06,710
um kind of looking at these Spike
outputs from the um our electrodes and

7610
02:40:06,710 --> 02:40:06,720
outputs from the um our electrodes and
 

7611
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:09,349
outputs from the um our electrodes and
what happened is that kind of uh four

7612
02:40:09,349 --> 02:40:09,359
what happened is that kind of uh four
 

7613
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:12,070
what happened is that kind of uh four
weeks into the surgery uh we noticed

7614
02:40:12,070 --> 02:40:12,080
weeks into the surgery uh we noticed
 

7615
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:14,469
weeks into the surgery uh we noticed
that the threats have slowly come out of

7616
02:40:14,469 --> 02:40:14,479
that the threats have slowly come out of
 

7617
02:40:14,479 --> 02:40:15,750
that the threats have slowly come out of
the brain and the way in which we

7618
02:40:15,750 --> 02:40:15,760
the brain and the way in which we
 

7619
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:18,190
the brain and the way in which we
noticed this at first obviously is that

7620
02:40:18,190 --> 02:40:18,200
noticed this at first obviously is that
 

7621
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:19,750
noticed this at first obviously is that
uh well I think Nolan was the first to

7622
02:40:19,750 --> 02:40:19,760
uh well I think Nolan was the first to
 

7623
02:40:19,760 --> 02:40:21,630
uh well I think Nolan was the first to
notice that his performance was

7624
02:40:21,630 --> 02:40:21,640
notice that his performance was
 

7625
02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:25,830
notice that his performance was
degrading um and I think at the time we

7626
02:40:25,830 --> 02:40:25,840
degrading um and I think at the time we
 

7627
02:40:25,840 --> 02:40:27,269
degrading um and I think at the time we
were also trying to do bunch of

7628
02:40:27,269 --> 02:40:27,279
were also trying to do bunch of
 

7629
02:40:27,279 --> 02:40:29,230
were also trying to do bunch of
different experimentation um you know

7630
02:40:29,230 --> 02:40:29,240
different experimentation um you know
 

7631
02:40:29,240 --> 02:40:31,710
different experimentation um you know
different algorithms different um sort

7632
02:40:31,710 --> 02:40:31,720
different algorithms different um sort
 

7633
02:40:31,720 --> 02:40:34,750
different algorithms different um sort
of UI ux so it was expected that there

7634
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:34,760
of UI ux so it was expected that there
 

7635
02:40:34,760 --> 02:40:37,110
of UI ux so it was expected that there
will be variability in the performance

7636
02:40:37,110 --> 02:40:37,120
will be variability in the performance
 

7637
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:40,309
will be variability in the performance
um but we did see kind of a steady

7638
02:40:40,309 --> 02:40:40,319
um but we did see kind of a steady
 

7639
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:42,950
um but we did see kind of a steady
decline and then also the way in which

7640
02:40:42,950 --> 02:40:42,960
decline and then also the way in which
 

7641
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:45,710
decline and then also the way in which
we measure the health of the electrod or

7642
02:40:45,710 --> 02:40:45,720
we measure the health of the electrod or
 

7643
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:47,710
we measure the health of the electrod or
whether they're in the brain or not is

7644
02:40:47,710 --> 02:40:47,720
whether they're in the brain or not is
 

7645
02:40:47,720 --> 02:40:50,990
whether they're in the brain or not is
by measuring uh imp of the electrode so

7646
02:40:50,990 --> 02:40:51,000
by measuring uh imp of the electrode so
 

7647
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,550
by measuring uh imp of the electrode so
we look at kind of the

7648
02:40:52,550 --> 02:40:52,560
we look at kind of the
 

7649
02:40:52,560 --> 02:40:55,230
we look at kind of the
interfacial um kind of the the the

7650
02:40:55,230 --> 02:40:55,240
interfacial um kind of the the the
 

7651
02:40:55,240 --> 02:40:57,550
interfacial um kind of the the the
Randle circuit they they say um you know

7652
02:40:57,550 --> 02:40:57,560
Randle circuit they they say um you know
 

7653
02:40:57,560 --> 02:41:00,190
Randle circuit they they say um you know
the capacitance and the and the um the

7654
02:41:00,190 --> 02:41:00,200
the capacitance and the and the um the
 

7655
02:41:00,200 --> 02:41:01,910
the capacitance and the and the um the
resistance between the electr Surface

7656
02:41:01,910 --> 02:41:01,920
resistance between the electr Surface
 

7657
02:41:01,920 --> 02:41:04,070
resistance between the electr Surface
and the medium and if that changes in

7658
02:41:04,070 --> 02:41:04,080
and the medium and if that changes in
 

7659
02:41:04,080 --> 02:41:06,150
and the medium and if that changes in
some dramatic ways we have some

7660
02:41:06,150 --> 02:41:06,160
some dramatic ways we have some
 

7661
02:41:06,160 --> 02:41:07,790
some dramatic ways we have some
indication or if you're not seeing

7662
02:41:07,790 --> 02:41:07,800
indication or if you're not seeing
 

7663
02:41:07,800 --> 02:41:09,190
indication or if you're not seeing
spikes on those channels you have some

7664
02:41:09,190 --> 02:41:09,200
spikes on those channels you have some
 

7665
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:10,950
spikes on those channels you have some
indications that something's happening

7666
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:10,960
indications that something's happening
 

7667
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:12,830
indications that something's happening
there and what we notice is that looking

7668
02:41:12,830 --> 02:41:12,840
there and what we notice is that looking
 

7669
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:15,070
there and what we notice is that looking
at those impedence plot and Spike rate

7670
02:41:15,070 --> 02:41:15,080
at those impedence plot and Spike rate
 

7671
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:17,510
at those impedence plot and Spike rate
plots and also because we have those

7672
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:17,520
plots and also because we have those
 

7673
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:20,230
plots and also because we have those
electrodes recording along the death you

7674
02:41:20,230 --> 02:41:20,240
electrodes recording along the death you
 

7675
02:41:20,240 --> 02:41:21,830
electrodes recording along the death you
were seeing some sort of movement that

7676
02:41:21,830 --> 02:41:21,840
were seeing some sort of movement that
 

7677
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:23,670
were seeing some sort of movement that
indicated that threads were being pulled

7678
02:41:23,670 --> 02:41:23,680
indicated that threads were being pulled
 

7679
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:26,670
indicated that threads were being pulled
out um and that obviously will have an

7680
02:41:26,670 --> 02:41:26,680
out um and that obviously will have an
 

7681
02:41:26,680 --> 02:41:28,950
out um and that obviously will have an
implication on the model side because if

7682
02:41:28,950 --> 02:41:28,960
implication on the model side because if
 

7683
02:41:28,960 --> 02:41:31,030
implication on the model side because if
you're the number of inputs that are

7684
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:31,040
you're the number of inputs that are
 

7685
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:33,670
you're the number of inputs that are
going into the model is changing because

7686
02:41:33,670 --> 02:41:33,680
going into the model is changing because
 

7687
02:41:33,680 --> 02:41:36,790
going into the model is changing because
you have less of them um the out that

7688
02:41:36,790 --> 02:41:36,800
you have less of them um the out that
 

7689
02:41:36,800 --> 02:41:39,389
you have less of them um the out that
that model needs to get updated right

7690
02:41:39,389 --> 02:41:39,399
that model needs to get updated right
 

7691
02:41:39,399 --> 02:41:40,790
that model needs to get updated right
and

7692
02:41:40,790 --> 02:41:40,800
and
 

7693
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:43,790
and
um but but there were still signals and

7694
02:41:43,790 --> 02:41:43,800
um but but there were still signals and
 

7695
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:45,389
um but but there were still signals and
as I mentioned similar to how even when

7696
02:41:45,389 --> 02:41:45,399
as I mentioned similar to how even when
 

7697
02:41:45,399 --> 02:41:47,230
as I mentioned similar to how even when
you place the signals on the surface of

7698
02:41:47,230 --> 02:41:47,240
you place the signals on the surface of
 

7699
02:41:47,240 --> 02:41:49,750
you place the signals on the surface of
the bra of the brain or farther weight

7700
02:41:49,750 --> 02:41:49,760
the bra of the brain or farther weight
 

7701
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:51,269
the bra of the brain or farther weight
like outside the skull you still see

7702
02:41:51,269 --> 02:41:51,279
like outside the skull you still see
 

7703
02:41:51,279 --> 02:41:54,030
like outside the skull you still see
some useful signals um what we started

7704
02:41:54,030 --> 02:41:54,040
some useful signals um what we started
 

7705
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:55,750
some useful signals um what we started
looking at is not just the spike

7706
02:41:55,750 --> 02:41:55,760
looking at is not just the spike
 

7707
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:58,150
looking at is not just the spike
occurrence through this boss algorithm

7708
02:41:58,150 --> 02:41:58,160
occurrence through this boss algorithm
 

7709
02:41:58,160 --> 02:42:00,349
occurrence through this boss algorithm
that I mentioned um but we started

7710
02:42:00,349 --> 02:42:00,359
that I mentioned um but we started
 

7711
02:42:00,359 --> 02:42:03,389
that I mentioned um but we started
looking at just the the the power of the

7712
02:42:03,389 --> 02:42:03,399
looking at just the the the power of the
 

7713
02:42:03,399 --> 02:42:06,750
looking at just the the the power of the
frequency band that is um interesting

7714
02:42:06,750 --> 02:42:06,760
frequency band that is um interesting
 

7715
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:09,670
frequency band that is um interesting
for uh Nolan or Nolan to be able to

7716
02:42:09,670 --> 02:42:09,680
for uh Nolan or Nolan to be able to
 

7717
02:42:09,680 --> 02:42:12,910
for uh Nolan or Nolan to be able to
modulate so once we kind of change the

7718
02:42:12,910 --> 02:42:12,920
modulate so once we kind of change the
 

7719
02:42:12,920 --> 02:42:16,750
modulate so once we kind of change the
algorithm for the implant to not just

7720
02:42:16,750 --> 02:42:16,760
algorithm for the implant to not just
 

7721
02:42:16,760 --> 02:42:18,750
algorithm for the implant to not just
give you the boss output but also these

7722
02:42:18,750 --> 02:42:18,760
give you the boss output but also these
 

7723
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:22,190
give you the boss output but also these
uh band power output um that helped us

7724
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:22,200
uh band power output um that helped us
 

7725
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:24,070
uh band power output um that helped us
sort of refine the model with the new

7726
02:42:24,070 --> 02:42:24,080
sort of refine the model with the new
 

7727
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:26,429
sort of refine the model with the new
set of inputs and that that was the

7728
02:42:26,429 --> 02:42:26,439
set of inputs and that that was the
 

7729
02:42:26,439 --> 02:42:28,110
set of inputs and that that was the
thing that really ultimately gave us the

7730
02:42:28,110 --> 02:42:28,120
thing that really ultimately gave us the
 

7731
02:42:28,120 --> 02:42:32,429
thing that really ultimately gave us the
performance back um you know in terms

7732
02:42:32,429 --> 02:42:32,439
performance back um you know in terms
 

7733
02:42:32,439 --> 02:42:35,389
performance back um you know in terms
of and obviously like the the thing that

7734
02:42:35,389 --> 02:42:35,399
of and obviously like the the thing that
 

7735
02:42:35,399 --> 02:42:38,309
of and obviously like the the thing that
we want ultimately and the thing that we

7736
02:42:38,309 --> 02:42:38,319
we want ultimately and the thing that we
 

7737
02:42:38,319 --> 02:42:40,269
we want ultimately and the thing that we
are working towards is figuring out ways

7738
02:42:40,269 --> 02:42:40,279
are working towards is figuring out ways
 

7739
02:42:40,279 --> 02:42:42,389
are working towards is figuring out ways
in which we can keep those threads

7740
02:42:42,389 --> 02:42:42,399
in which we can keep those threads
 

7741
02:42:42,399 --> 02:42:45,429
in which we can keep those threads
intact um for as long as possible so

7742
02:42:45,429 --> 02:42:45,439
intact um for as long as possible so
 

7743
02:42:45,439 --> 02:42:47,870
intact um for as long as possible so
that we have many more channels going

7744
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:47,880
that we have many more channels going
 

7745
02:42:47,880 --> 02:42:50,030
that we have many more channels going
into the model that's that's by far the

7746
02:42:50,030 --> 02:42:50,040
into the model that's that's by far the
 

7747
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:51,469
into the model that's that's by far the
number one priority that the team is

7748
02:42:51,469 --> 02:42:51,479
number one priority that the team is
 

7749
02:42:51,479 --> 02:42:53,550
number one priority that the team is
currently embarking on to understand how

7750
02:42:53,550 --> 02:42:53,560
currently embarking on to understand how
 

7751
02:42:53,560 --> 02:42:56,750
currently embarking on to understand how
to prevent that from happening um the

7752
02:42:56,750 --> 02:42:56,760
to prevent that from happening um the
 

7753
02:42:56,760 --> 02:42:59,030
to prevent that from happening um the
thing that I will say also is

7754
02:42:59,030 --> 02:42:59,040
thing that I will say also is
 

7755
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:01,230
thing that I will say also is
that you know as I mentioned this is the

7756
02:43:01,230 --> 02:43:01,240
that you know as I mentioned this is the
 

7757
02:43:01,240 --> 02:43:03,230
that you know as I mentioned this is the
first time ever that we're putting these

7758
02:43:03,230 --> 02:43:03,240
first time ever that we're putting these
 

7759
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:05,910
first time ever that we're putting these
threats in in a human brain and you know

7760
02:43:05,910 --> 02:43:05,920
threats in in a human brain and you know
 

7761
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:07,990
threats in in a human brain and you know
human brain just for a size reference is

7762
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:08,000
human brain just for a size reference is
 

7763
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,750
human brain just for a size reference is
10 times out of the monkey brain or the

7764
02:43:10,750 --> 02:43:10,760
10 times out of the monkey brain or the
 

7765
02:43:10,760 --> 02:43:14,309
10 times out of the monkey brain or the
Sheep brain and it it's um just a very

7766
02:43:14,309 --> 02:43:14,319
Sheep brain and it it's um just a very
 

7767
02:43:14,319 --> 02:43:15,990
Sheep brain and it it's um just a very
very different environment it moves a

7768
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:16,000
very different environment it moves a
 

7769
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,590
very different environment it moves a
lot more it like actually moved a lot

7770
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:17,600
lot more it like actually moved a lot
 

7771
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:20,550
lot more it like actually moved a lot
more than we expected um when we uh did

7772
02:43:20,550 --> 02:43:20,560
more than we expected um when we uh did
 

7773
02:43:20,560 --> 02:43:24,910
more than we expected um when we uh did
did Nolan surgery and um it's uh just a

7774
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:24,920
did Nolan surgery and um it's uh just a
 

7775
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:26,590
did Nolan surgery and um it's uh just a
very very different environment than

7776
02:43:26,590 --> 02:43:26,600
very very different environment than
 

7777
02:43:26,600 --> 02:43:28,750
very very different environment than
what we're used to and this is why we do

7778
02:43:28,750 --> 02:43:28,760
what we're used to and this is why we do
 

7779
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:30,590
what we're used to and this is why we do
clinical trial right we we we want to

7780
02:43:30,590 --> 02:43:30,600
clinical trial right we we we want to
 

7781
02:43:30,600 --> 02:43:33,710
clinical trial right we we we want to
uncover some of these uh issues uh and

7782
02:43:33,710 --> 02:43:33,720
uncover some of these uh issues uh and
 

7783
02:43:33,720 --> 02:43:37,870
uncover some of these uh issues uh and
and failure modes earlier than later so

7784
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:37,880
and failure modes earlier than later so
 

7785
02:43:37,880 --> 02:43:40,070
and failure modes earlier than later so
in many ways it's provided us with this

7786
02:43:40,070 --> 02:43:40,080
in many ways it's provided us with this
 

7787
02:43:40,080 --> 02:43:44,870
in many ways it's provided us with this
enormous amount of data and um

7788
02:43:44,870 --> 02:43:44,880
enormous amount of data and um
 

7789
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:47,510
enormous amount of data and um
information to be able to uh solve this

7790
02:43:47,510 --> 02:43:47,520
information to be able to uh solve this
 

7791
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:48,630
information to be able to uh solve this
and this is something that neuralink is

7792
02:43:48,630 --> 02:43:48,640
and this is something that neuralink is
 

7793
02:43:48,640 --> 02:43:50,550
and this is something that neuralink is
extremely good at once we have set of

7794
02:43:50,550 --> 02:43:50,560
extremely good at once we have set of
 

7795

we have enormous amount of talents
 

7799
02:43:55,279 --> 02:43:57,750
we have enormous amount of talents
across many many disciplines to be able

7800
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:57,760
across many many disciplines to be able
 

7801
02:43:57,760 --> 02:43:59,870
across many many disciplines to be able
to come together and fix the problem

7802
02:43:59,870 --> 02:43:59,880
to come together and fix the problem
 

7803
02:43:59,880 --> 02:44:02,190
to come together and fix the problem
very very quickly but it sounds like one

7804
02:44:02,190 --> 02:44:02,200
very very quickly but it sounds like one
 

7805
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:04,469
very very quickly but it sounds like one
of the fascinating challenges here is

7806
02:44:04,469 --> 02:44:04,479
of the fascinating challenges here is
 

7807
02:44:04,479 --> 02:44:07,670
of the fascinating challenges here is
for the system and the decoding side to

7808
02:44:07,670 --> 02:44:07,680
for the system and the decoding side to
 

7809
02:44:07,680 --> 02:44:09,750
for the system and the decoding side to
be adaptable across different time

7810
02:44:09,750 --> 02:44:09,760
be adaptable across different time
 

7811
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:13,150
be adaptable across different time
scales so whether it's movement of

02:44:13,150 --> 02:44:13,160
scales so whether it's movement of
 

7813
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:15,790
scales so whether it's movement of
threads or different aspects of signal

ux challenge to how to do that so it

7824
02:44:27,950 --> 02:44:27,960
ux challenge to how to do that so it
 

7825
02:44:27,960 --> 02:44:30,590
ux challenge to how to do that so it
sounds like adaptability is like a

7826
02:44:30,590 --> 02:44:30,600
sounds like adaptability is like a

what's interesting about this geometry

7894
02:45:51,190 --> 02:45:51,200
what's interesting about this geometry
 

7895
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:52,750
what's interesting about this geometry
so we're look at this just geometry of a

7896
02:45:52,750 --> 02:45:52,760
so we're look at this just geometry of a
 

7897
02:45:52,760 --> 02:45:55,630
so we're look at this just geometry of a
needle this is the needle that's

7898
02:45:55,630 --> 02:45:55,640
needle this is the needle that's

engaging with the loops in the thread

7900
02:45:58,469 --> 02:45:58,479
engaging with the loops in the thread
 

7901
02:45:58,479 --> 02:46:01,670
engaging with the loops in the thread
mhm so they're the ones that um you know

7902
02:46:01,670 --> 02:46:01,680
mhm so they're the ones that um you know
 

7903
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:04,190
mhm so they're the ones that um you know
thread the thread the loop um and then

7904
02:46:04,190 --> 02:46:04,200
thread the thread the loop um and then
 

7905
02:46:04,200 --> 02:46:06,950
thread the thread the loop um and then
peel it from the Silicon backing and

7906
02:46:06,950 --> 02:46:06,960
peel it from the Silicon backing and
 

7907
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:08,670
peel it from the Silicon backing and
then this is the thing that gets

7908
02:46:08,670 --> 02:46:08,680
then this is the thing that gets
 

7909
02:46:08,680 --> 02:46:11,429
then this is the thing that gets
inserted into the tissue and then this

7910
02:46:11,429 --> 02:46:11,439
inserted into the tissue and then this
 

7911
02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:14,110
inserted into the tissue and then this
pulls out leaving the thread and this

7912
02:46:14,110 --> 02:46:14,120
pulls out leaving the thread and this
 

7913
02:46:14,120 --> 02:46:17,990
pulls out leaving the thread and this
kind of a notch or the shark tooth that

7914
02:46:17,990 --> 02:46:18,000
kind of a notch or the shark tooth that
 

7915
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:19,710
kind of a notch or the shark tooth that
we used to call

7916
02:46:19,710 --> 02:46:19,720
we used to call
 

7917
02:46:19,720 --> 02:46:22,830
we used to call
uh is the thing that actually is um

7918
02:46:22,830 --> 02:46:22,840
uh is the thing that actually is um
 

7919
02:46:22,840 --> 02:46:25,190
uh is the thing that actually is um
grasping the loop and then it's it's

7920
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:25,200
grasping the loop and then it's it's
 

7921
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:27,070
grasping the loop and then it's it's
designed in such way such that when you

7922
02:46:27,070 --> 02:46:27,080
designed in such way such that when you
 

7923
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:28,910
designed in such way such that when you
when you pull out leavs the loop and the

7924
02:46:28,910 --> 02:46:28,920
when you pull out leavs the loop and the
 

7925
02:46:28,920 --> 02:46:31,269
when you pull out leavs the loop and the
robot is controlling this needle correct

7926
02:46:31,269 --> 02:46:31,279
robot is controlling this needle correct
 

7927
02:46:31,279 --> 02:46:33,590
robot is controlling this needle correct
so this is actually housed in a canula

7928
02:46:33,590 --> 02:46:33,600
so this is actually housed in a canula
 

7929
02:46:33,600 --> 02:46:36,389
so this is actually housed in a canula
and basically the robot is has a lot of

7930
02:46:36,389 --> 02:46:36,399
and basically the robot is has a lot of
 

7931
02:46:36,399 --> 02:46:38,990
and basically the robot is has a lot of
Optics that look for where the loop is

7932
02:46:38,990 --> 02:46:39,000
Optics that look for where the loop is
 

7933
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:40,950
Optics that look for where the loop is
um there's actually a 405 nanometer

7934
02:46:40,950 --> 02:46:40,960
um there's actually a 405 nanometer
 

7935
02:46:40,960 --> 02:46:44,670
um there's actually a 405 nanometer
light that actually causes the poly to

7936
02:46:44,670 --> 02:46:44,680
light that actually causes the poly to
 

7937
02:46:44,680 --> 02:46:46,990
light that actually causes the poly to
fluores so that you can locate the the

7938
02:46:46,990 --> 02:46:47,000
fluores so that you can locate the the
 

7939
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:50,990
fluores so that you can locate the the
location of the loop um lights up yeah

7940
02:46:50,990 --> 02:46:51,000
location of the loop um lights up yeah
 

7941
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,830
location of the loop um lights up yeah
yeah they do it's a micron Precision

7942
02:46:53,830 --> 02:46:53,840
yeah they do it's a micron Precision
 

7943
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:55,710
yeah they do it's a micron Precision
process what's interesting about the

7944
02:46:55,710 --> 02:46:55,720
process what's interesting about the
 

7945
02:46:55,720 --> 02:46:57,230
process what's interesting about the
robot that it takes to do that that's

7946
02:46:57,230 --> 02:46:57,240
robot that it takes to do that that's
 

7947
02:46:57,240 --> 02:46:59,550
robot that it takes to do that that's
that's pretty crazy that's pretty crazy

7948
02:46:59,550 --> 02:46:59,560
that's pretty crazy that's pretty crazy
 

7949
02:46:59,560 --> 02:47:01,030
that's pretty crazy that's pretty crazy
that a robot is able to get this kind of

7950
02:47:01,030 --> 02:47:01,040
that a robot is able to get this kind of
 

7951
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:03,710
that a robot is able to get this kind of
precision yeah our robot is quite heavy

7952
02:47:03,710 --> 02:47:03,720
precision yeah our robot is quite heavy
 

7953
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:06,870
precision yeah our robot is quite heavy
um our current version of it um there's

7954
02:47:06,870 --> 02:47:06,880
um our current version of it um there's
 

7955
02:47:06,880 --> 02:47:09,510
um our current version of it um there's
I mean it's it's like a giant granite

7956
02:47:09,510 --> 02:47:09,520
I mean it's it's like a giant granite
 

7957
02:47:09,520 --> 02:47:13,269
I mean it's it's like a giant granite
slab that weighs about a ton um because

7958
02:47:13,269 --> 02:47:13,279
slab that weighs about a ton um because
 

7959
02:47:13,279 --> 02:47:15,349
slab that weighs about a ton um because
it needs to be sensitive to vibration

7960
02:47:15,349 --> 02:47:15,359
it needs to be sensitive to vibration
 

7961
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:17,230
it needs to be sensitive to vibration
environmental vibration and then as the

7962
02:47:17,230 --> 02:47:17,240
environmental vibration and then as the
 

7963
02:47:17,240 --> 02:47:18,670
environmental vibration and then as the
head is moving at the speed that it's

7964
02:47:18,670 --> 02:47:18,680
head is moving at the speed that it's
 

7965
02:47:18,680 --> 02:47:21,630
head is moving at the speed that it's
mov moving you know there's a lot of

7966
02:47:21,630 --> 02:47:21,640
mov moving you know there's a lot of
 

7967
02:47:21,640 --> 02:47:24,230
mov moving you know there's a lot of
kind of motion control to make sure that

7968
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:24,240
kind of motion control to make sure that
 

7969
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:27,070
kind of motion control to make sure that
you can achieve that level of precision

7970
02:47:27,070 --> 02:47:27,080
you can achieve that level of precision
 

7971
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:29,710
you can achieve that level of precision
um a lot of Optics that kind of zoom in

7972
02:47:29,710 --> 02:47:29,720
um a lot of Optics that kind of zoom in
 

7973
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:31,429
um a lot of Optics that kind of zoom in
on that um you know we're working on

7974
02:47:31,429 --> 02:47:31,439
on that um you know we're working on
 

7975
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:33,550
on that um you know we're working on
next generation of the robot that is

7976
02:47:33,550 --> 02:47:33,560
next generation of the robot that is
 

7977
02:47:33,560 --> 02:47:35,710
next generation of the robot that is
lighter easier to transport I mean it is

7978
02:47:35,710 --> 02:47:35,720
lighter easier to transport I mean it is
 

7979
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:38,309
lighter easier to transport I mean it is
a it is a feat to move the robot to and

7980
02:47:38,309 --> 02:47:38,319
a it is a feat to move the robot to and
 

7981
02:47:38,319 --> 02:47:40,469
a it is a feat to move the robot to and
it's far superior to a human surgeon at

7982
02:47:40,469 --> 02:47:40,479
it's far superior to a human surgeon at
 

7983
02:47:40,479 --> 02:47:42,309
it's far superior to a human surgeon at
this time for this particular task

7984
02:47:42,309 --> 02:47:42,319
this time for this particular task
 

7985
02:47:42,319 --> 02:47:44,230
this time for this particular task
absolutely I mean let alone you try to

7986
02:47:44,230 --> 02:47:44,240
absolutely I mean let alone you try to
 

7987
02:47:44,240 --> 02:47:46,349
absolutely I mean let alone you try to
actually thread a loop in a in a a

7988
02:47:46,349 --> 02:47:46,359
actually thread a loop in a in a a
 

7989
02:47:46,359 --> 02:47:48,110
actually thread a loop in a in a a
sewing kit I mean this is like we're

7990
02:47:48,110 --> 02:47:48,120
sewing kit I mean this is like we're
 

7991
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:51,510
sewing kit I mean this is like we're
talking like fractions of human hair

7992
02:47:51,510 --> 02:47:51,520
talking like fractions of human hair
 

7993
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:53,030
talking like fractions of human hair
these these things are it's it's not

7994
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:53,040
these these things are it's it's not
 

7995
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:55,550
these these things are it's it's not
visible so continuing the paragraph we

7996
02:47:55,550 --> 02:47:55,560
visible so continuing the paragraph we
 

7997
02:47:55,560 --> 02:47:57,030
visible so continuing the paragraph we
developed novel hardware and software

7998
02:47:57,030 --> 02:47:57,040
developed novel hardware and software
 

7999
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:58,830
developed novel hardware and software
testing system such as our accelerated

8000
02:47:58,830 --> 02:47:58,840
testing system such as our accelerated
 

8001
02:47:58,840 --> 02:48:00,670
testing system such as our accelerated
lifetime testing racks and simulated

8002
02:48:00,670 --> 02:48:00,680
lifetime testing racks and simulated
 

8003
02:48:00,680 --> 02:48:02,670
lifetime testing racks and simulated
surgery environment which is pretty cool

8004
02:48:02,670 --> 02:48:02,680
surgery environment which is pretty cool
 

8005
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:04,150
surgery environment which is pretty cool
to stress test and validate the

8006
02:48:04,150 --> 02:48:04,160
to stress test and validate the
 

8007
02:48:04,160 --> 02:48:06,110
to stress test and validate the
robustness of our Technologies We

8008
02:48:06,110 --> 02:48:06,120
robustness of our Technologies We
 

8009
02:48:06,120 --> 02:48:08,389
robustness of our Technologies We
performed many rehearsals of our

8010
02:48:08,389 --> 02:48:08,399
performed many rehearsals of our
 

8011
02:48:08,399 --> 02:48:11,150
performed many rehearsals of our
surgeries to refine our procedures and

8012
02:48:11,150 --> 02:48:11,160
surgeries to refine our procedures and
 

8013
02:48:11,160 --> 02:48:14,030
surgeries to refine our procedures and
make them um second nature this is

8014
02:48:14,030 --> 02:48:14,040
make them um second nature this is
 

8015
02:48:14,040 --> 02:48:15,349
make them um second nature this is
pretty

8016
02:48:15,349 --> 02:48:15,359
pretty
 

8017
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:17,910
pretty
cool we practice surgeries on proxies

8018
02:48:17,910 --> 02:48:17,920
cool we practice surgeries on proxies
 

8019
02:48:17,920 --> 02:48:19,670
cool we practice surgeries on proxies
with all the hardware instruments needed

8020
02:48:19,670 --> 02:48:19,680
with all the hardware instruments needed
 

8021
02:48:19,680 --> 02:48:22,309
with all the hardware instruments needed
in our mock or in the engineering space

8022
02:48:22,309 --> 02:48:22,319
in our mock or in the engineering space
 

8023
02:48:22,319 --> 02:48:24,190
in our mock or in the engineering space
this helps us rapidly test and so

8024
02:48:24,190 --> 02:48:24,200
this helps us rapidly test and so
 

8025
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:26,309
this helps us rapidly test and so
there's like proxies yeah this proxy is

8026
02:48:26,309 --> 02:48:26,319
there's like proxies yeah this proxy is
 

8027
02:48:26,319 --> 02:48:29,309
there's like proxies yeah this proxy is
super cool actually so there's a 3D

8028
02:48:29,309 --> 02:48:29,319
super cool actually so there's a 3D
 

8029
02:48:29,319 --> 02:48:33,269
super cool actually so there's a 3D
printed skull from the images that is

8030
02:48:33,269 --> 02:48:33,279
printed skull from the images that is
 

8031
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:36,349
printed skull from the images that is
taken at Barrow as well as this uh

8032
02:48:36,349 --> 02:48:36,359
taken at Barrow as well as this uh
 

8033
02:48:36,359 --> 02:48:39,389
taken at Barrow as well as this uh
hydrogel mix you know sort of synthetic

8034
02:48:39,389 --> 02:48:39,399
hydrogel mix you know sort of synthetic
 

8035
02:48:39,399 --> 02:48:41,469
hydrogel mix you know sort of synthetic
polymer thing that actually mimics the

8036
02:48:41,469 --> 02:48:41,479
polymer thing that actually mimics the
 

8037
02:48:41,479 --> 02:48:43,870
polymer thing that actually mimics the
the mechanical properties of the brain

8038
02:48:43,870 --> 02:48:43,880
the mechanical properties of the brain
 

8039
02:48:43,880 --> 02:48:48,469
the mechanical properties of the brain
um it also has vasculature of the person

8040
02:48:48,469 --> 02:48:48,479
um it also has vasculature of the person
 

8041
02:48:48,479 --> 02:48:49,630
um it also has vasculature of the person
um

8042
02:48:49,630 --> 02:48:49,640
um
 

8043
02:48:49,640 --> 02:48:52,630
um
so basically what we're talking about

8044
02:48:52,630 --> 02:48:52,640
so basically what we're talking about
 

8045
02:48:52,640 --> 02:48:55,150
so basically what we're talking about
here and there's a lot of work that has

8046
02:48:55,150 --> 02:48:55,160
here and there's a lot of work that has
 

8047
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:59,670
here and there's a lot of work that has
gone into making this set proxy that um

8048
02:48:59,670 --> 02:48:59,680
gone into making this set proxy that um
 

8049
02:48:59,680 --> 02:49:01,190
gone into making this set proxy that um
you know it's about like finding the

8050
02:49:01,190 --> 02:49:01,200
you know it's about like finding the
 

8051
02:49:01,200 --> 02:49:02,950
you know it's about like finding the
right concentration of these different

8052
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:02,960
right concentration of these different
 

8053
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:04,590
right concentration of these different
synthetic polymers to get the right set

8054
02:49:04,590 --> 02:49:04,600
synthetic polymers to get the right set
 

8055
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:06,950
synthetic polymers to get the right set
of consistency for the needle Dynamics

8056
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:06,960
of consistency for the needle Dynamics
 

8057
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:09,269
of consistency for the needle Dynamics
you know as they're being inserted but

8058
02:49:09,269 --> 02:49:09,279
you know as they're being inserted but
 

8059
02:49:09,279 --> 02:49:12,469
you know as they're being inserted but
we practice this surgery

8060
02:49:12,469 --> 02:49:12,479
we practice this surgery
 

8061
02:49:12,479 --> 02:49:15,349
we practice this surgery
with the person you know Nolan's

8062
02:49:15,349 --> 02:49:15,359
with the person you know Nolan's
 

8063
02:49:15,359 --> 02:49:18,510
with the person you know Nolan's
basically physiology and brain um many

8064
02:49:18,510 --> 02:49:18,520
basically physiology and brain um many
 

8065
02:49:18,520 --> 02:49:20,309
basically physiology and brain um many
many many times prior to actually doing

8066
02:49:20,309 --> 02:49:20,319
many many times prior to actually doing
 

8067
02:49:20,319 --> 02:49:23,070
many many times prior to actually doing
the surgery every every step every step

8068
02:49:23,070 --> 02:49:23,080
the surgery every every step every step
 

8069
02:49:23,080 --> 02:49:25,030
the surgery every every step every step
every step yeah like where does someone

8070
02:49:25,030 --> 02:49:25,040
every step yeah like where does someone
 

8071
02:49:25,040 --> 02:49:27,070
every step yeah like where does someone
stand like I mean like you looking at is

8072
02:49:27,070 --> 02:49:27,080
stand like I mean like you looking at is
 

8073
02:49:27,080 --> 02:49:30,710
stand like I mean like you looking at is
the picture this is in in in our office

8074
02:49:30,710 --> 02:49:30,720
the picture this is in in in our office
 

8075
02:49:30,720 --> 02:49:33,309
the picture this is in in in our office
of this kind of corner of the robot

8076
02:49:33,309 --> 02:49:33,319
of this kind of corner of the robot
 

8077
02:49:33,319 --> 02:49:35,670
of this kind of corner of the robot
engineering space that we you know have

8078
02:49:35,670 --> 02:49:35,680
engineering space that we you know have
 

8079
02:49:35,680 --> 02:49:37,750
engineering space that we you know have
created this like mock or space that

8080
02:49:37,750 --> 02:49:37,760
created this like mock or space that
 

8081
02:49:37,760 --> 02:49:39,750
created this like mock or space that
looks exactly like what they would

8082
02:49:39,750 --> 02:49:39,760
looks exactly like what they would
 

8083
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:40,830
looks exactly like what they would
experience all the staff would

8084
02:49:40,830 --> 02:49:40,840
experience all the staff would
 

8085
02:49:40,840 --> 02:49:42,469
experience all the staff would
experience during their actual surgery

8086
02:49:42,469 --> 02:49:42,479
experience during their actual surgery
 

8087
02:49:42,479 --> 02:49:44,630
experience during their actual surgery
so I mean it's just kind of like any

8088
02:49:44,630 --> 02:49:44,640
so I mean it's just kind of like any
 

8089
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:46,469
so I mean it's just kind of like any
dense rehearsal where you know exactly

8090
02:49:46,469 --> 02:49:46,479
dense rehearsal where you know exactly
 

8091
02:49:46,479 --> 02:49:47,510
dense rehearsal where you know exactly
where you're going to stand at what

8092
02:49:47,510 --> 02:49:47,520
where you're going to stand at what
 

8093
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:50,070
where you're going to stand at what
point um you just practice that over and

8094
02:49:50,070 --> 02:49:50,080
point um you just practice that over and
 

8095
02:49:50,080 --> 02:49:52,710
point um you just practice that over and
over and over again with an exact

8096
02:49:52,710 --> 02:49:52,720
over and over again with an exact
 

8097
02:49:52,720 --> 02:49:54,429
over and over again with an exact
anatomy of someone that you're going to

8098
02:49:54,429 --> 02:49:54,439
anatomy of someone that you're going to
 

8099
02:49:54,439 --> 02:49:56,790
anatomy of someone that you're going to
surger eyesee and and it it got to a

8100
02:49:56,790 --> 02:49:56,800
surger eyesee and and it it got to a
 

8101
02:49:56,800 --> 02:49:59,510
surger eyesee and and it it got to a
point where a lot of our Engineers when

8102
02:49:59,510 --> 02:49:59,520
point where a lot of our Engineers when
 

8103
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:01,670
point where a lot of our Engineers when
we created a craniectomy they're like ah

8104
02:50:01,670 --> 02:50:01,680
we created a craniectomy they're like ah
 

8105
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:02,870
we created a craniectomy they're like ah
that that looks very

8106
02:50:02,870 --> 02:50:02,880
that that looks very
 

8107
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:06,710
that that looks very
familiar we've seen that before yeah man

8108
02:50:06,710 --> 02:50:06,720
familiar we've seen that before yeah man
 

8109
02:50:06,720 --> 02:50:08,229
familiar we've seen that before yeah man
there's wisdom you can gain through

8110
02:50:08,229 --> 02:50:08,239
there's wisdom you can gain through
 

8111
02:50:08,239 --> 02:50:09,469
there's wisdom you can gain through
doing the same thing over and over and

8112
02:50:09,469 --> 02:50:09,479
doing the same thing over and over and
 

8113
02:50:09,479 --> 02:50:11,790
doing the same thing over and over and
over it's like a jro Dreams of Sushi

8114
02:50:11,790 --> 02:50:11,800
over it's like a jro Dreams of Sushi
 

8115
02:50:11,800 --> 02:50:12,670
over it's like a jro Dreams of Sushi
kind of

8116
02:50:12,670 --> 02:50:12,680
kind of
 

8117
02:50:12,680 --> 02:50:15,469
kind of
thing um because then um it's like

8118
02:50:15,469 --> 02:50:15,479
thing um because then um it's like
 

8119
02:50:15,479 --> 02:50:16,950
thing um because then um it's like
Olympic athletes

8120
02:50:16,950 --> 02:50:16,960
Olympic athletes
 

8121
02:50:16,960 --> 02:50:20,510
Olympic athletes
visualize uh the Olympics and then once

8122
02:50:20,510 --> 02:50:20,520
visualize uh the Olympics and then once
 

8123
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:24,070
visualize uh the Olympics and then once
you actually show up it feels easy it

8124
02:50:24,070 --> 02:50:24,080
you actually show up it feels easy it
 

8125
02:50:24,080 --> 02:50:26,309
you actually show up it feels easy it
feels like any other day it feels Almost

8126
02:50:26,309 --> 02:50:26,319
feels like any other day it feels Almost
 

8127
02:50:26,319 --> 02:50:29,190
feels like any other day it feels Almost
Boring winning the gold medal cuz you

8128
02:50:29,190 --> 02:50:29,200
Boring winning the gold medal cuz you
 

8129
02:50:29,200 --> 02:50:31,030
Boring winning the gold medal cuz you
You' visualized this so many times

8130
02:50:31,030 --> 02:50:31,040
You' visualized this so many times
 

8131
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:33,269
You' visualized this so many times
you've practiced this so many times that

8132
02:50:33,269 --> 02:50:33,279
you've practiced this so many times that
 

8133
02:50:33,279 --> 02:50:35,309
you've practiced this so many times that
nothing bothers in you it's boring you

8134
02:50:35,309 --> 02:50:35,319
nothing bothers in you it's boring you
 

8135
02:50:35,319 --> 02:50:38,110
nothing bothers in you it's boring you
win the gold medal is boring and the

8136
02:50:38,110 --> 02:50:38,120
win the gold medal is boring and the
 

8137
02:50:38,120 --> 02:50:39,590
win the gold medal is boring and the
experience they talk about is mostly

8138
02:50:39,590 --> 02:50:39,600
experience they talk about is mostly
 

8139
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:40,790
experience they talk about is mostly
just

8140
02:50:40,790 --> 02:50:40,800
just
 

8141
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:42,750
just
relief probably that they don't have to

8142
02:50:42,750 --> 02:50:42,760
relief probably that they don't have to
 

8143
02:50:42,760 --> 02:50:45,510
relief probably that they don't have to
visualize it anymore yeah the power of

8144
02:50:45,510 --> 02:50:45,520
visualize it anymore yeah the power of
 

8145
02:50:45,520 --> 02:50:48,150
visualize it anymore yeah the power of
the mind to visualize and where I mean

8146
02:50:48,150 --> 02:50:48,160
the mind to visualize and where I mean
 

8147
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:50,030
the mind to visualize and where I mean
there's a whole whole feel that studies

8148
02:50:50,030 --> 02:50:50,040
there's a whole whole feel that studies
 

8149
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:53,870
there's a whole whole feel that studies
where muscle memory lies in cerebellum

8150
02:50:53,870 --> 02:50:53,880
where muscle memory lies in cerebellum
 

8151
02:50:53,880 --> 02:50:55,030
where muscle memory lies in cerebellum
yeah it's

8152
02:50:55,030 --> 02:50:55,040
yeah it's
 

8153
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:57,030
yeah it's
incredible uh I think there a good place

8154
02:50:57,030 --> 02:50:57,040
incredible uh I think there a good place
 

8155
02:50:57,040 --> 02:50:58,030
incredible uh I think there a good place
to

8156
02:50:58,030 --> 02:50:58,040
to
 

8157
02:50:58,040 --> 02:51:00,150
to
actually ask sort of the big question

8158
02:51:00,150 --> 02:51:00,160
actually ask sort of the big question
 

8159
02:51:00,160 --> 02:51:02,630
actually ask sort of the big question
that people might have is how do we know

8160
02:51:02,630 --> 02:51:02,640
that people might have is how do we know
 

8161
02:51:02,640 --> 02:51:04,469
that people might have is how do we know
every aspect of this that you describe

8162
02:51:04,469 --> 02:51:04,479
every aspect of this that you describe
 

8163
02:51:04,479 --> 02:51:06,950
every aspect of this that you describe
is safe at the end of the day the goal

8164
02:51:06,950 --> 02:51:06,960
is safe at the end of the day the goal
 

8165
02:51:06,960 --> 02:51:10,269
is safe at the end of the day the goal
standard is to look at the tissue um you

8166
02:51:10,269 --> 02:51:10,279
standard is to look at the tissue um you
 

8167
02:51:10,279 --> 02:51:11,830
standard is to look at the tissue um you
know what sort of trauma did you cause

8168
02:51:11,830 --> 02:51:11,840
know what sort of trauma did you cause
 

8169
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:13,870
know what sort of trauma did you cause
the tissue and does that correlate to

8170
02:51:13,870 --> 02:51:13,880
the tissue and does that correlate to
 

8171
02:51:13,880 --> 02:51:15,670
the tissue and does that correlate to
whatever behavioral anomalies that you

8172
02:51:15,670 --> 02:51:15,680
whatever behavioral anomalies that you
 

8173
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:18,910
whatever behavioral anomalies that you
may have seen um and that's the language

8174
02:51:18,910 --> 02:51:18,920
may have seen um and that's the language
 

8175
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:22,110
may have seen um and that's the language
to which uh we we can communicate about

8176
02:51:22,110 --> 02:51:22,120
to which uh we we can communicate about
 

8177
02:51:22,120 --> 02:51:23,870
to which uh we we can communicate about
the safety of you know inserting

8178
02:51:23,870 --> 02:51:23,880
the safety of you know inserting
 

8179
02:51:23,880 --> 02:51:26,349
the safety of you know inserting
something into the brain and what type

8180
02:51:26,349 --> 02:51:26,359
something into the brain and what type
 

8181
02:51:26,359 --> 02:51:29,910
something into the brain and what type
of trauma that you can cause so um we

8182
02:51:29,910 --> 02:51:29,920
of trauma that you can cause so um we
 

8183
02:51:29,920 --> 02:51:33,710
of trauma that you can cause so um we
actually have an entire department uh

8184
02:51:33,710 --> 02:51:33,720
actually have an entire department uh
 

8185
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:35,990
actually have an entire department uh
Department of pathology that looks at

8186
02:51:35,990 --> 02:51:36,000
Department of pathology that looks at
 

8187
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,590
Department of pathology that looks at
these uh tissue slices there are many

8188
02:51:38,590 --> 02:51:38,600
these uh tissue slices there are many
 

8189
02:51:38,600 --> 02:51:40,830
these uh tissue slices there are many
steps that are involved in in doing this

8190
02:51:40,830 --> 02:51:40,840
steps that are involved in in doing this
 

8191
02:51:40,840 --> 02:51:44,229
steps that are involved in in doing this
once you have um you know studies that

8192
02:51:44,229 --> 02:51:44,239
once you have um you know studies that
 

8193
02:51:44,239 --> 02:51:47,030
once you have um you know studies that
are launched to uh with with particular

8194
02:51:47,030 --> 02:51:47,040
are launched to uh with with particular
 

8195
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:48,990
are launched to uh with with particular
end points in mind you know at some

8196
02:51:48,990 --> 02:51:49,000
end points in mind you know at some
 

8197
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,750
end points in mind you know at some
point you have to euthanize the animal

8198
02:51:50,750 --> 02:51:50,760
point you have to euthanize the animal
 

8199
02:51:50,760 --> 02:51:53,030
point you have to euthanize the animal
and then uh you go through necropsy to

8200
02:51:53,030 --> 02:51:53,040
and then uh you go through necropsy to
 

8201
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:55,469
and then uh you go through necropsy to
kind of collect the brain tissue samples

8202
02:51:55,469 --> 02:51:55,479
kind of collect the brain tissue samples
 

8203
02:51:55,479 --> 02:51:57,990
kind of collect the brain tissue samples
um you know you fix them in formalin and

8204
02:51:57,990 --> 02:51:58,000
um you know you fix them in formalin and
 

8205
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,150
um you know you fix them in formalin and
you like gross them you section them and

8206
02:52:00,150 --> 02:52:00,160
you like gross them you section them and
 

8207
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:02,070
you like gross them you section them and
you look at individual slices just to

8208
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:02,080
you look at individual slices just to
 

8209
02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:03,710
you look at individual slices just to
see what kind of reaction or lack

8210
02:52:03,710 --> 02:52:03,720
see what kind of reaction or lack
 

8211
02:52:03,720 --> 02:52:06,710
see what kind of reaction or lack
thereof exists so that's the kind of the

8212
02:52:06,710 --> 02:52:06,720
thereof exists so that's the kind of the
 

8213
02:52:06,720 --> 02:52:09,229
thereof exists so that's the kind of the
language to which FDA speaks and you

8214
02:52:09,229 --> 02:52:09,239
language to which FDA speaks and you
 

8215
02:52:09,239 --> 02:52:11,910
language to which FDA speaks and you
know as well for us to kind of evaluate

8216
02:52:11,910 --> 02:52:11,920
know as well for us to kind of evaluate
 

8217
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:13,750
know as well for us to kind of evaluate
the safety of the insertion mechanism as

8218
02:52:13,750 --> 02:52:13,760
the safety of the insertion mechanism as
 

8219
02:52:13,760 --> 02:52:16,190
the safety of the insertion mechanism as
well as the threats um at various

8220
02:52:16,190 --> 02:52:16,200
well as the threats um at various
 

8221
02:52:16,200 --> 02:52:17,710
well as the threats um at various
different time points you know both

8222
02:52:17,710 --> 02:52:17,720
different time points you know both
 

8223
02:52:17,720 --> 02:52:21,830
different time points you know both
acute um so anywhere between you know uh

8224
02:52:21,830 --> 02:52:21,840
acute um so anywhere between you know uh
 

8225
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:24,710
acute um so anywhere between you know uh
zero to three months to Beyond three

8226
02:52:24,710 --> 02:52:24,720
zero to three months to Beyond three
 

8227
02:52:24,720 --> 02:52:26,469
zero to three months to Beyond three
months so those the kind of the the

8228
02:52:26,469 --> 02:52:26,479
months so those the kind of the the
 

8229
02:52:26,479 --> 02:52:29,710
months so those the kind of the the
details of an extremely high standard of

8230
02:52:29,710 --> 02:52:29,720
details of an extremely high standard of
 

8231
02:52:29,720 --> 02:52:32,389
details of an extremely high standard of
safety that has to be reached correct um

8232
02:52:32,389 --> 02:52:32,399
safety that has to be reached correct um
 

8233
02:52:32,399 --> 02:52:35,510
safety that has to be reached correct um
FDA supervises this but there's in

8234
02:52:35,510 --> 02:52:35,520
FDA supervises this but there's in
 

8235
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:37,110
FDA supervises this but there's in
general just a very high standard and

8236
02:52:37,110 --> 02:52:37,120
general just a very high standard and
 

8237
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,429
general just a very high standard and
every aspect of this including the

8238
02:52:38,429 --> 02:52:38,439
every aspect of this including the
 

8239
02:52:38,439 --> 02:52:41,429
every aspect of this including the
surgery I think U Matthew McDougall has

8240
02:52:41,429 --> 02:52:41,439
surgery I think U Matthew McDougall has
 

8241
02:52:41,439 --> 02:52:46,349
surgery I think U Matthew McDougall has
mentioned that like the standard is

8242
02:52:46,349 --> 02:52:46,359
mentioned that like the standard is
 

8243
02:52:46,359 --> 02:52:50,269
mentioned that like the standard is
uh let's say how to put politely higher

8244
02:52:50,269 --> 02:52:50,279
uh let's say how to put politely higher
 

8245
02:52:50,279 --> 02:52:52,190
uh let's say how to put politely higher
than maybe some other operations that we

8246
02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:52,200
than maybe some other operations that we
 

8247
02:52:52,200 --> 02:52:54,670
than maybe some other operations that we
take for granted so the the standard for

8248
02:52:54,670 --> 02:52:54,680
take for granted so the the standard for
 

8249
02:52:54,680 --> 02:52:57,110
take for granted so the the standard for
all the surgical stuff here is extremely

8250
02:52:57,110 --> 02:52:57,120
all the surgical stuff here is extremely
 

8251
02:52:57,120 --> 02:52:58,990
all the surgical stuff here is extremely
high very high I mean it's a highly

8252
02:52:58,990 --> 02:52:59,000
high very high I mean it's a highly
 

8253
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,309
high very high I mean it's a highly
highly regulated environment um with you

8254
02:53:02,309 --> 02:53:02,319
highly regulated environment um with you
 

8255
02:53:02,319 --> 02:53:05,229
highly regulated environment um with you
know the governing agencies that

8256
02:53:05,229 --> 02:53:05,239
know the governing agencies that
 

8257
02:53:05,239 --> 02:53:08,150
know the governing agencies that
scrutinize every every medical device

8258
02:53:08,150 --> 02:53:08,160
scrutinize every every medical device
 

8259
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:09,830
scrutinize every every medical device
that gets marketed and I think I think

8260
02:53:09,830 --> 02:53:09,840
that gets marketed and I think I think
 

8261
02:53:09,840 --> 02:53:11,469
that gets marketed and I think I think
it's a good thing um you know it's good

8262
02:53:11,469 --> 02:53:11,479
it's a good thing um you know it's good
 

8263
02:53:11,479 --> 02:53:13,990
it's a good thing um you know it's good
to have those high standards and we we

8264
02:53:13,990 --> 02:53:14,000
to have those high standards and we we
 

8265
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,590
to have those high standards and we we
try to hold extremely high standards um

8266
02:53:16,590 --> 02:53:16,600
try to hold extremely high standards um
 

8267
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:19,309
try to hold extremely high standards um
to kind of understand what's sort of

8268
02:53:19,309 --> 02:53:19,319
to kind of understand what's sort of
 

8269
02:53:19,319 --> 02:53:21,790
to kind of understand what's sort of
damage if any these uh Innovative

8270
02:53:21,790 --> 02:53:21,800
damage if any these uh Innovative
 

8271
02:53:21,800 --> 02:53:23,190
damage if any these uh Innovative
emerging Technologies and new

8272
02:53:23,190 --> 02:53:23,200
emerging Technologies and new
 

8273
02:53:23,200 --> 02:53:26,150
emerging Technologies and new
technologies that we're building our and

8274
02:53:26,150 --> 02:53:26,160
technologies that we're building our and
 

8275
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:28,429
technologies that we're building our and
you know so far I I we have been

8276
02:53:28,429 --> 02:53:28,439
you know so far I I we have been
 

8277
02:53:28,439 --> 02:53:32,269
you know so far I I we have been
extremely impressed by lack of immune

8278
02:53:32,269 --> 02:53:32,279
extremely impressed by lack of immune
 

8279
02:53:32,279 --> 02:53:34,870
extremely impressed by lack of immune
response from these threats speaking of

8280
02:53:34,870 --> 02:53:34,880
response from these threats speaking of
 

8281
02:53:34,880 --> 02:53:38,469
response from these threats speaking of
which you uh you talked to me uh with

8282
02:53:38,469 --> 02:53:38,479
which you uh you talked to me uh with
 

8283
02:53:38,479 --> 02:53:40,150
which you uh you talked to me uh with
excitement about the histology and some

8284
02:53:40,150 --> 02:53:40,160
excitement about the histology and some
 

8285
02:53:40,160 --> 02:53:42,110
excitement about the histology and some
of the images uh that you're able to

8286
02:53:42,110 --> 02:53:42,120
of the images uh that you're able to
 

8287
02:53:42,120 --> 02:53:44,389
of the images uh that you're able to
share uh can you explain to me what

8288
02:53:44,389 --> 02:53:44,399
share uh can you explain to me what
 

8289
02:53:44,399 --> 02:53:46,630
share uh can you explain to me what
we're looking at yeah so what you're

8290
02:53:46,630 --> 02:53:46,640
we're looking at yeah so what you're
 

8291
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:49,309
we're looking at yeah so what you're
looking at is stain

8292
02:53:49,309 --> 02:53:49,319
looking at is stain
 

8293
02:53:49,319 --> 02:53:52,510
looking at is stain
tissue image um so this is a

8294
02:53:52,510 --> 02:53:52,520
tissue image um so this is a
 

8295
02:53:52,520 --> 02:53:55,510
tissue image um so this is a
sectioned a tissue slice from an animal

8296
02:53:55,510 --> 02:53:55,520
sectioned a tissue slice from an animal
 

8297
02:53:55,520 --> 02:53:56,990
sectioned a tissue slice from an animal
that was implanted for seven months so

8298
02:53:56,990 --> 02:53:57,000
that was implanted for seven months so
 

8299
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,830
that was implanted for seven months so
kind of a chronic time point and you're

8300
02:53:59,830 --> 02:53:59,840
kind of a chronic time point and you're
 

8301
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:02,510
kind of a chronic time point and you're
seeing all these different colors and

8302
02:54:02,510 --> 02:54:02,520
seeing all these different colors and
 

8303
02:54:02,520 --> 02:54:04,790
seeing all these different colors and
each color indicates specific types of

8304
02:54:04,790 --> 02:54:04,800
each color indicates specific types of
 

8305
02:54:04,800 --> 02:54:07,790
each color indicates specific types of
cell types so purple and pink are

8306
02:54:07,790 --> 02:54:07,800
cell types so purple and pink are
 

8307
02:54:07,800 --> 02:54:10,590
cell types so purple and pink are
astrocytes and microa respectively

8308
02:54:10,590 --> 02:54:10,600
astrocytes and microa respectively
 

8309
02:54:10,600 --> 02:54:13,190
astrocytes and microa respectively
they're type of uh gal cells and yeah

8310
02:54:13,190 --> 02:54:13,200
they're type of uh gal cells and yeah
 

8311
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:14,630
they're type of uh gal cells and yeah
the the other thing that you know people

8312
02:54:14,630 --> 02:54:14,640
the the other thing that you know people
 

8313
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:17,190
the the other thing that you know people
may not be aware of is your brain is not

8314
02:54:17,190 --> 02:54:17,200
may not be aware of is your brain is not
 

8315
02:54:17,200 --> 02:54:19,269
may not be aware of is your brain is not
just made up of soup of neurons and

8316
02:54:19,269 --> 02:54:19,279
just made up of soup of neurons and
 

8317
02:54:19,279 --> 02:54:22,950
just made up of soup of neurons and
axons there are other uh you know cells

8318
02:54:22,950 --> 02:54:22,960
axons there are other uh you know cells
 

8319
02:54:22,960 --> 02:54:26,190
axons there are other uh you know cells
like uh gal cells that actually kind of

8320
02:54:26,190 --> 02:54:26,200
like uh gal cells that actually kind of
 

8321
02:54:26,200 --> 02:54:29,950
like uh gal cells that actually kind of
is the glue and also uh react uh if if

8322
02:54:29,950 --> 02:54:29,960
is the glue and also uh react uh if if
 

8323
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:32,309
is the glue and also uh react uh if if
there any trauma or damage to the tissue

8324
02:54:32,309 --> 02:54:32,319
there any trauma or damage to the tissue
 

8325
02:54:32,319 --> 02:54:33,990
there any trauma or damage to the tissue
but the brown are the neurons here the

8326
02:54:33,990 --> 02:54:34,000
but the brown are the neurons here the
 

8327
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,750
but the brown are the neurons here the
brown are the neurons neurons nuclei so

8328
02:54:36,750 --> 02:54:36,760
brown are the neurons neurons nuclei so
 

8329
02:54:36,760 --> 02:54:38,229
brown are the neurons neurons nuclei so
so what you're seeing is in in this kind

8330
02:54:38,229 --> 02:54:38,239
so what you're seeing is in in this kind
 

8331
02:54:38,239 --> 02:54:40,990
so what you're seeing is in in this kind
of macro image you're seeing these like

8332
02:54:40,990 --> 02:54:41,000
of macro image you're seeing these like
 

8333
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:44,070
of macro image you're seeing these like
Circle highlighted in white the

8334
02:54:44,070 --> 02:54:44,080
Circle highlighted in white the
 

8335
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:47,110
Circle highlighted in white the
insertion sight and uh when you zoom

8336
02:54:47,110 --> 02:54:47,120
insertion sight and uh when you zoom
 

8337
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:49,550
insertion sight and uh when you zoom
into one of those you see the threads

8338
02:54:49,550 --> 02:54:49,560
into one of those you see the threads
 

8339
02:54:49,560 --> 02:54:51,110
into one of those you see the threads
and then in this particular case I think

8340
02:54:51,110 --> 02:54:51,120
and then in this particular case I think
 

8341
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:53,870
and then in this particular case I think
we're seeing about the 16 uh you know

8342
02:54:53,870 --> 02:54:53,880
we're seeing about the 16 uh you know
 

8343
02:54:53,880 --> 02:54:56,590
we're seeing about the 16 uh you know
wires that are going into the page and

8344
02:54:56,590 --> 02:54:56,600
wires that are going into the page and
 

8345
02:54:56,600 --> 02:54:58,469
wires that are going into the page and
the incredible thing here is the fact

8346
02:54:58,469 --> 02:54:58,479
the incredible thing here is the fact
 

8347
02:54:58,479 --> 02:55:00,670
the incredible thing here is the fact
that you have the neurons that are these

8348
02:55:00,670 --> 02:55:00,680
that you have the neurons that are these
 

8349
02:55:00,680 --> 02:55:02,950
that you have the neurons that are these
Brown structures or brown circular or

8350
02:55:02,950 --> 02:55:02,960
Brown structures or brown circular or
 

8351
02:55:02,960 --> 02:55:04,870
Brown structures or brown circular or
elliptical thing that are actually

8352
02:55:04,870 --> 02:55:04,880
elliptical thing that are actually
 

8353
02:55:04,880 --> 02:55:08,110
elliptical thing that are actually
touching and abing the threats so what

8354
02:55:08,110 --> 02:55:08,120
touching and abing the threats so what
 

8355
02:55:08,120 --> 02:55:09,990
touching and abing the threats so what
this is saying is that there's basically

8356
02:55:09,990 --> 02:55:10,000
this is saying is that there's basically
 

8357
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,429
this is saying is that there's basically
zero trauma that's caused during this

8358
02:55:12,429 --> 02:55:12,439
zero trauma that's caused during this
 

8359
02:55:12,439 --> 02:55:14,389
zero trauma that's caused during this
insertion and with these neural

8360
02:55:14,389 --> 02:55:14,399
insertion and with these neural
 

8361
02:55:14,399 --> 02:55:16,830
insertion and with these neural
interfaces these um micro electros that

8362
02:55:16,830 --> 02:55:16,840
interfaces these um micro electros that
 

8363
02:55:16,840 --> 02:55:18,750
interfaces these um micro electros that
you insert that is one of the most

8364
02:55:18,750 --> 02:55:18,760
you insert that is one of the most
 

8365
02:55:18,760 --> 02:55:20,990
you insert that is one of the most
common mode of failure so when you

8366
02:55:20,990 --> 02:55:21,000
common mode of failure so when you
 

8367
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,349
common mode of failure so when you
insert these threads like the utar It

8368
02:55:23,349 --> 02:55:23,359
insert these threads like the utar It
 

8369
02:55:23,359 --> 02:55:26,349
insert these threads like the utar It
causes neuronal Death Around the site

8370
02:55:26,349 --> 02:55:26,359
causes neuronal Death Around the site
 

8371
02:55:26,359 --> 02:55:27,950
causes neuronal Death Around the site
because you're inserting a foreign

8372
02:55:27,950 --> 02:55:27,960
because you're inserting a foreign
 

8373
02:55:27,960 --> 02:55:31,389
because you're inserting a foreign
object right and that kind of elicit

8374
02:55:31,389 --> 02:55:31,399
object right and that kind of elicit
 

8375
02:55:31,399 --> 02:55:32,950
object right and that kind of elicit
these like immune response through

8376
02:55:32,950 --> 02:55:32,960
these like immune response through
 

8377
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:36,110
these like immune response through
microglia and asites they form this like

8378
02:55:36,110 --> 02:55:36,120
microglia and asites they form this like
 

8379
02:55:36,120 --> 02:55:38,030
microglia and asites they form this like
protective layer around it oh not only

8380
02:55:38,030 --> 02:55:38,040
protective layer around it oh not only
 

8381
02:55:38,040 --> 02:55:39,590
protective layer around it oh not only
are you killing the neuron cells but

8382
02:55:39,590 --> 02:55:39,600
are you killing the neuron cells but
 

8383
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:41,190
are you killing the neuron cells but
you're also creating this protective

8384
02:55:41,190 --> 02:55:41,200
you're also creating this protective
 

8385
02:55:41,200 --> 02:55:43,830
you're also creating this protective
layer that then basically prevents you

8386
02:55:43,830 --> 02:55:43,840
layer that then basically prevents you
 

8387
02:55:43,840 --> 02:55:45,389
layer that then basically prevents you
from recording neural signals because

8388
02:55:45,389 --> 02:55:45,399
from recording neural signals because
 

8389
02:55:45,399 --> 02:55:46,630
from recording neural signals because
you're getting further and further away

8390
02:55:46,630 --> 02:55:46,640
you're getting further and further away
 

8391
02:55:46,640 --> 02:55:47,750
you're getting further and further away
from the neurons that you're trying to

8392
02:55:47,750 --> 02:55:47,760
from the neurons that you're trying to
 

8393
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:49,830
from the neurons that you're trying to
record and that that is the biggest mode

8394
02:55:49,830 --> 02:55:49,840
record and that that is the biggest mode
 

8395
02:55:49,840 --> 02:55:51,510
record and that that is the biggest mode
of failure and in this particular

8396
02:55:51,510 --> 02:55:51,520
of failure and in this particular
 

8397
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:53,790
of failure and in this particular
example in that inset it's you know it's

8398
02:55:53,790 --> 02:55:53,800
example in that inset it's you know it's
 

8399
02:55:53,800 --> 02:55:56,030
example in that inset it's you know it's
about 50 Micron with that scale bar the

8400
02:55:56,030 --> 02:55:56,040
about 50 Micron with that scale bar the
 

8401
02:55:56,040 --> 02:55:58,469
about 50 Micron with that scale bar the
neurons are just seem to be attracted to

8402
02:55:58,469 --> 02:55:58,479
neurons are just seem to be attracted to
 

8403
02:55:58,479 --> 02:56:01,070
neurons are just seem to be attracted to
it and so there's certainly no trauma

8404
02:56:01,070 --> 02:56:01,080
it and so there's certainly no trauma
 

8405
02:56:01,080 --> 02:56:02,710
it and so there's certainly no trauma
that's such a beautiful image by the way

8406
02:56:02,710 --> 02:56:02,720
that's such a beautiful image by the way
 

8407
02:56:02,720 --> 02:56:05,030
that's such a beautiful image by the way
just the so the brown or the

8408
02:56:05,030 --> 02:56:05,040
just the so the brown or the
 

8409
02:56:05,040 --> 02:56:07,190
just the so the brown or the
neurons and for some reason I can't look

8410
02:56:07,190 --> 02:56:07,200
neurons and for some reason I can't look
 

8411
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:09,150
neurons and for some reason I can't look
away it's really cool and and the way

8412
02:56:09,150 --> 02:56:09,160
away it's really cool and and the way
 

8413
02:56:09,160 --> 02:56:11,070
away it's really cool and and the way
that these things like I mean your

8414
02:56:11,070 --> 02:56:11,080
that these things like I mean your
 

8415
02:56:11,080 --> 02:56:12,710
that these things like I mean your
tissues generally don't have these

8416
02:56:12,710 --> 02:56:12,720
tissues generally don't have these
 

8417
02:56:12,720 --> 02:56:15,269
tissues generally don't have these
beautiful colors um this is uh Multiplex

8418
02:56:15,269 --> 02:56:15,279
beautiful colors um this is uh Multiplex
 

8419
02:56:15,279 --> 02:56:17,790
beautiful colors um this is uh Multiplex
stain that uses these different uh

8420
02:56:17,790 --> 02:56:17,800
stain that uses these different uh
 

8421
02:56:17,800 --> 02:56:19,910
stain that uses these different uh
protein that are staining these at

8422
02:56:19,910 --> 02:56:19,920
protein that are staining these at
 

8423
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:22,229
protein that are staining these at
different colors you know we use very

8424
02:56:22,229 --> 02:56:22,239
different colors you know we use very
 

8425
02:56:22,239 --> 02:56:24,550
different colors you know we use very
standard set of um you know staining

8426
02:56:24,550 --> 02:56:24,560
standard set of um you know staining
 

8427
02:56:24,560 --> 02:56:28,190
standard set of um you know staining
techniques with HG ea1 and you know new

8428
02:56:28,190 --> 02:56:28,200
techniques with HG ea1 and you know new
 

8429
02:56:28,200 --> 02:56:30,670
techniques with HG ea1 and you know new
um and and GAP so if you go to the next

8430
02:56:30,670 --> 02:56:30,680
um and and GAP so if you go to the next
 

8431
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:32,830
um and and GAP so if you go to the next
image this is also kind of illustrates

8432
02:56:32,830 --> 02:56:32,840
image this is also kind of illustrates
 

8433
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:34,469
image this is also kind of illustrates
the second point because you can make an

8434
02:56:34,469 --> 02:56:34,479
the second point because you can make an
 

8435
02:56:34,479 --> 02:56:36,150
the second point because you can make an
argument and initially when we saw the

8436
02:56:36,150 --> 02:56:36,160
argument and initially when we saw the
 

8437
02:56:36,160 --> 02:56:38,150
argument and initially when we saw the
the previous image we said oh like are

8438
02:56:38,150 --> 02:56:38,160
the previous image we said oh like are
 

8439
02:56:38,160 --> 02:56:40,190
the previous image we said oh like are
the threads just floating like what is

8440
02:56:40,190 --> 02:56:40,200
the threads just floating like what is
 

8441
02:56:40,200 --> 02:56:41,510
the threads just floating like what is
happening here like are we actually

8442
02:56:41,510 --> 02:56:41,520
happening here like are we actually
 

8443
02:56:41,520 --> 02:56:43,269
happening here like are we actually
looking at the right thing so what we

8444
02:56:43,269 --> 02:56:43,279
looking at the right thing so what we
 

8445
02:56:43,279 --> 02:56:45,550
looking at the right thing so what we
did is we did another stain and this is

8446
02:56:45,550 --> 02:56:45,560
did is we did another stain and this is
 

8447
02:56:45,560 --> 02:56:48,870
did is we did another stain and this is
all done in-house of this M's uh TR

8448
02:56:48,870 --> 02:56:48,880
all done in-house of this M's uh TR
 

8449
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:51,389
all done in-house of this M's uh TR
Chrome stain which is in blue that shows

8450
02:56:51,389 --> 02:56:51,399
Chrome stain which is in blue that shows
 

8451
02:56:51,399 --> 02:56:54,229
Chrome stain which is in blue that shows
these collagen layers so the blue

8452
02:56:54,229 --> 02:56:54,239
these collagen layers so the blue
 

8453
02:56:54,239 --> 02:56:55,790
these collagen layers so the blue
basically like you don't want the blue

8454
02:56:55,790 --> 02:56:55,800
basically like you don't want the blue
 

8455
02:56:55,800 --> 02:56:58,590
basically like you don't want the blue
around the the implant threads CU that

8456
02:56:58,590 --> 02:56:58,600
around the the implant threads CU that
 

8457
02:56:58,600 --> 02:57:00,750
around the the implant threads CU that
means that there's some sort of scarring

8458
02:57:00,750 --> 02:57:00,760
means that there's some sort of scarring
 

8459
02:57:00,760 --> 02:57:03,070
means that there's some sort of scarring
that's happen and what you're seeing if

8460
02:57:03,070 --> 02:57:03,080
that's happen and what you're seeing if
 

8461
02:57:03,080 --> 02:57:04,510
that's happen and what you're seeing if
you look at individual threads is that

8462
02:57:04,510 --> 02:57:04,520
you look at individual threads is that
 

8463
02:57:04,520 --> 02:57:06,110
you look at individual threads is that
you don't see any of the

8464
02:57:06,110 --> 02:57:06,120
you don't see any of the
 

8465
02:57:06,120 --> 02:57:09,070
you don't see any of the
blue which means that there has been

8466
02:57:09,070 --> 02:57:09,080
blue which means that there has been
 

8467
02:57:09,080 --> 02:57:11,830
blue which means that there has been
absolutely or very very minimal to a

8468
02:57:11,830 --> 02:57:11,840
absolutely or very very minimal to a
 

8469
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:13,510
absolutely or very very minimal to a
point where it's not detectable amount

8470
02:57:13,510 --> 02:57:13,520
point where it's not detectable amount
 

8471
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:16,429
point where it's not detectable amount
of trauma in these inserted threads so

8472
02:57:16,429 --> 02:57:16,439
of trauma in these inserted threads so
 

8473
02:57:16,439 --> 02:57:17,870
of trauma in these inserted threads so
that presumably is one of the big

8474
02:57:17,870 --> 02:57:17,880
that presumably is one of the big
 

8475
02:57:17,880 --> 02:57:19,429
that presumably is one of the big
benefit because of having this kind of

8476
02:57:19,429 --> 02:57:19,439
benefit because of having this kind of
 

8477
02:57:19,439 --> 02:57:21,710
benefit because of having this kind of
flexible thread this yeah so we think

8478
02:57:21,710 --> 02:57:21,720
flexible thread this yeah so we think
 

8479
02:57:21,720 --> 02:57:24,950
flexible thread this yeah so we think
this is uh primarily due to uh the size

8480
02:57:24,950 --> 02:57:24,960
this is uh primarily due to uh the size
 

8481
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:26,389
this is uh primarily due to uh the size
as well as the flexibility of the

8482
02:57:26,389 --> 02:57:26,399
as well as the flexibility of the
 

8483
02:57:26,399 --> 02:57:29,070
as well as the flexibility of the
threats also the fact that R1 is

8484
02:57:29,070 --> 02:57:29,080
threats also the fact that R1 is
 

8485
02:57:29,080 --> 02:57:31,750
threats also the fact that R1 is
avoiding vasculature so we're not

8486
02:57:31,750 --> 02:57:31,760
avoiding vasculature so we're not
 

8487
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:34,710
avoiding vasculature so we're not
disrupting or we're not um causing

8488
02:57:34,710 --> 02:57:34,720
disrupting or we're not um causing
 

8489
02:57:34,720 --> 02:57:37,389
disrupting or we're not um causing
damage to uh the vessels and not

8490
02:57:37,389 --> 02:57:37,399
damage to uh the vessels and not
 

8491
02:57:37,399 --> 02:57:40,429
damage to uh the vessels and not
breaking any of the bloodb brain barrier

8492
02:57:40,429 --> 02:57:40,439
breaking any of the bloodb brain barrier
 

8493
02:57:40,439 --> 02:57:43,150
breaking any of the bloodb brain barrier
uh has you know basically caused the

8494
02:57:43,150 --> 02:57:43,160
uh has you know basically caused the
 

8495
02:57:43,160 --> 02:57:45,990
uh has you know basically caused the
immune response to be muted but this is

8496
02:57:45,990 --> 02:57:46,000
immune response to be muted but this is
 

8497
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,389
immune response to be muted but this is
also a nice illustration of the size of

8498
02:57:48,389 --> 02:57:48,399
also a nice illustration of the size of
 

8499
02:57:48,399 --> 02:57:51,150
also a nice illustration of the size of
things so this is the tip of the thread

8500
02:57:51,150 --> 02:57:51,160
things so this is the tip of the thread
 

8501
02:57:51,160 --> 02:57:53,309
things so this is the tip of the thread
yeah those are neurons they're they're

8502
02:57:53,309 --> 02:57:53,319
yeah those are neurons they're they're
 

8503
02:57:53,319 --> 02:57:54,990
yeah those are neurons they're they're
and they're neurons and there and this

8504
02:57:54,990 --> 02:57:55,000
and they're neurons and there and this
 

8505
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,030
and they're neurons and there and this
is the thread listening and the

8506
02:57:57,030 --> 02:57:57,040
is the thread listening and the
 

8507
02:57:57,040 --> 02:57:59,630
is the thread listening and the
electrodes are positioned how yeah so

8508
02:57:59,630 --> 02:57:59,640
electrodes are positioned how yeah so
 

8509
02:57:59,640 --> 02:58:01,229
electrodes are positioned how yeah so
this is what you're looking at is not

8510
02:58:01,229 --> 02:58:01,239
this is what you're looking at is not
 

8511
02:58:01,239 --> 02:58:03,229
this is what you're looking at is not
electrod themselves those are the

8512
02:58:03,229 --> 02:58:03,239
electrod themselves those are the
 

8513
02:58:03,239 --> 02:58:05,950
electrod themselves those are the
conductive wires so each of those should

8514
02:58:05,950 --> 02:58:05,960
conductive wires so each of those should
 

8515
02:58:05,960 --> 02:58:10,670
conductive wires so each of those should
probably be two Micron in width um so

8516
02:58:10,670 --> 02:58:10,680
probably be two Micron in width um so
 

8517
02:58:10,680 --> 02:58:11,790
probably be two Micron in width um so
what we're looking at is we're looking

8518
02:58:11,790 --> 02:58:11,800
what we're looking at is we're looking
 

8519
02:58:11,800 --> 02:58:13,870
what we're looking at is we're looking
at the chral slice so we're looking at

8520
02:58:13,870 --> 02:58:13,880
at the chral slice so we're looking at
 

8521
02:58:13,880 --> 02:58:16,110
at the chral slice so we're looking at
uh some slice of the tissue so as you go

8522
02:58:16,110 --> 02:58:16,120
uh some slice of the tissue so as you go
 

8523
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:17,710
uh some slice of the tissue so as you go
deeper you know you will obviously have

8524
02:58:17,710 --> 02:58:17,720
deeper you know you will obviously have
 

8525
02:58:17,720 --> 02:58:20,349
deeper you know you will obviously have
less than less uh of the tapering of the

8526
02:58:20,349 --> 02:58:20,359
less than less uh of the tapering of the
 

8527
02:58:20,359 --> 02:58:24,950
less than less uh of the tapering of the
of the thread um but yeah the the point

8528
02:58:24,950 --> 02:58:24,960
of the thread um but yeah the the point
 

8529
02:58:24,960 --> 02:58:26,550
of the thread um but yeah the the point
basically being that there's just uh

8530
02:58:26,550 --> 02:58:26,560
basically being that there's just uh
 

8531
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:28,830
basically being that there's just uh
kind of cells around the insert aite

8532
02:58:28,830 --> 02:58:28,840
kind of cells around the insert aite
 

8533
02:58:28,840 --> 02:58:31,030
kind of cells around the insert aite
which is um just an incredible thing to

8534
02:58:31,030 --> 02:58:31,040
which is um just an incredible thing to
 

8535
02:58:31,040 --> 02:58:32,710
which is um just an incredible thing to
see I've just never seen anything like

8536
02:58:32,710 --> 02:58:32,720
see I've just never seen anything like
 

8537
02:58:32,720 --> 02:58:35,510
see I've just never seen anything like
this how easy and safe is it to remove

8538
02:58:35,510 --> 02:58:35,520
this how easy and safe is it to remove
 

8539
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:36,630
this how easy and safe is it to remove
the

8540
02:58:36,630 --> 02:58:36,640
the
 

8541
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:41,269
the
implant yeah so it depends on when um in

8542
02:58:41,269 --> 02:58:41,279
implant yeah so it depends on when um in
 

8543
02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:44,670
implant yeah so it depends on when um in
the first 3 months or so after the

8544
02:58:44,670 --> 02:58:44,680
the first 3 months or so after the
 

8545
02:58:44,680 --> 02:58:47,150
the first 3 months or so after the
surgery um there there's a lot of kind

8546
02:58:47,150 --> 02:58:47,160
surgery um there there's a lot of kind
 

8547
02:58:47,160 --> 02:58:49,510
surgery um there there's a lot of kind
of tissue modeling that's happening you

8548
02:58:49,510 --> 02:58:49,520
of tissue modeling that's happening you
 

8549
02:58:49,520 --> 02:58:51,630
of tissue modeling that's happening you
know similar to when you get a cut um

8550
02:58:51,630 --> 02:58:51,640
know similar to when you get a cut um
 

8551
02:58:51,640 --> 02:58:52,550
know similar to when you get a cut um
you know you

8552
02:58:52,550 --> 02:58:52,560
you know you
 

8553
02:58:52,560 --> 02:58:56,950
you know you
obviously uh you know start over first

8554
02:58:56,950 --> 02:58:56,960
obviously uh you know start over first
 

8555
02:58:56,960 --> 02:58:58,750
obviously uh you know start over first
couple weeks or depending on the size of

8556
02:58:58,750 --> 02:58:58,760
couple weeks or depending on the size of
 

8557
02:58:58,760 --> 02:59:01,590
couple weeks or depending on the size of
the wound um Scar Tissue forming right

8558
02:59:01,590 --> 02:59:01,600
the wound um Scar Tissue forming right
 

8559
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:03,510
the wound um Scar Tissue forming right
they're these like contracted and then

8560
02:59:03,510 --> 02:59:03,520
they're these like contracted and then
 

8561
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:05,110
they're these like contracted and then
in the end they turn into scab and you

8562
02:59:05,110 --> 02:59:05,120
in the end they turn into scab and you
 

8563
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:06,830
in the end they turn into scab and you
can scab it off the same thing happens

8564
02:59:06,830 --> 02:59:06,840
can scab it off the same thing happens
 

8565
02:59:06,840 --> 02:59:10,070
can scab it off the same thing happens
in the brain and it's a very Dynamic

8566
02:59:10,070 --> 02:59:10,080
in the brain and it's a very Dynamic
 

8567
02:59:10,080 --> 02:59:12,830
in the brain and it's a very Dynamic
environment and before the scar tissue

8568
02:59:12,830 --> 02:59:12,840
environment and before the scar tissue
 

8569
02:59:12,840 --> 02:59:14,429
environment and before the scar tissue
or the neom membrane or the you know new

8570
02:59:14,429 --> 02:59:14,439
or the neom membrane or the you know new
 

8571
02:59:14,439 --> 02:59:16,990
or the neom membrane or the you know new
membrane that forms it's quite easy to

8572
02:59:16,990 --> 02:59:17,000
membrane that forms it's quite easy to
 

8573
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:18,910
membrane that forms it's quite easy to
just pull them out um and there's

8574
02:59:18,910 --> 02:59:18,920
just pull them out um and there's
 

8575
02:59:18,920 --> 02:59:21,150
just pull them out um and there's
minimal trauma that's that's uh caused

8576
02:59:21,150 --> 02:59:21,160
minimal trauma that's that's uh caused
 

8577
02:59:21,160 --> 02:59:25,150
minimal trauma that's that's uh caused
during that once the scarf tissue forms

8578
02:59:25,150 --> 02:59:25,160
during that once the scarf tissue forms
 

8579
02:59:25,160 --> 02:59:27,190
during that once the scarf tissue forms
and you know with with Nolan as well we

8580
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:27,200
and you know with with Nolan as well we
 

8581
02:59:27,200 --> 02:59:28,510
and you know with with Nolan as well we
believe that that's the thing that's

8582
02:59:28,510 --> 02:59:28,520
believe that that's the thing that's
 

8583
02:59:28,520 --> 02:59:30,110
believe that that's the thing that's
currently anchoring the threads so we

8584
02:59:30,110 --> 02:59:30,120
currently anchoring the threads so we
 

8585
02:59:30,120 --> 02:59:32,469
currently anchoring the threads so we
haven't seen any more movements since

8586
02:59:32,469 --> 02:59:32,479
haven't seen any more movements since
 

8587
02:59:32,479 --> 02:59:35,190
haven't seen any more movements since
then um so they're they're quite

8588
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:35,200
then um so they're they're quite
 

8589
02:59:35,200 --> 02:59:38,269
then um so they're they're quite
stable um it's it's it gets harder to

8590
02:59:38,269 --> 02:59:38,279
stable um it's it's it gets harder to
 

8591
02:59:38,279 --> 02:59:40,469
stable um it's it's it gets harder to
actually completely extract the threads

8592
02:59:40,469 --> 02:59:40,479
actually completely extract the threads
 

8593
02:59:40,479 --> 02:59:42,429
actually completely extract the threads
so our current method

8594
02:59:42,429 --> 02:59:42,439
so our current method
 

8595
02:59:42,439 --> 02:59:45,790
so our current method
for uh removing the device is cutting

8596
02:59:45,790 --> 02:59:45,800
for uh removing the device is cutting
 

8597
02:59:45,800 --> 02:59:49,229
for uh removing the device is cutting
the thread leaving the the tissue intact

8598
02:59:49,229 --> 02:59:49,239
the thread leaving the the tissue intact
 

8599
02:59:49,239 --> 02:59:51,070
the thread leaving the the tissue intact
and then unscrewing and taking the

8600
02:59:51,070 --> 02:59:51,080
and then unscrewing and taking the
 

8601
02:59:51,080 --> 02:59:54,870
and then unscrewing and taking the
implant out and that hole is now going

8602
02:59:54,870 --> 02:59:54,880
implant out and that hole is now going
 

8603
02:59:54,880 --> 02:59:58,429
implant out and that hole is now going
to be plugged with either another

8604
02:59:58,429 --> 02:59:58,439
to be plugged with either another
 

8605
02:59:58,439 --> 03:00:01,550
to be plugged with either another
neuralink or uh just with the you know

8606
03:00:01,550 --> 03:00:01,560
neuralink or uh just with the you know
 

8607
03:00:01,560 --> 03:00:04,110
neuralink or uh just with the you know
kind of a a peak based you know plastic

8608
03:00:04,110 --> 03:00:04,120
kind of a a peak based you know plastic
 

8609
03:00:04,120 --> 03:00:06,950
kind of a a peak based you know plastic
based uh cap is it okay to leave the

8610
03:00:06,950 --> 03:00:06,960
based uh cap is it okay to leave the
 

8611
03:00:06,960 --> 03:00:08,269
based uh cap is it okay to leave the
threads in there

8612
03:00:08,269 --> 03:00:08,279
threads in there
 

8613
03:00:08,279 --> 03:00:10,710
threads in there
forever yeah we think so we we've done

8614
03:00:10,710 --> 03:00:10,720
forever yeah we think so we we've done
 

8615
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:13,070
forever yeah we think so we we've done
studies where um you know we left them

8616
03:00:13,070 --> 03:00:13,080
studies where um you know we left them
 

8617
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:14,910
studies where um you know we left them
there and one of the biggest concerns

8618
03:00:14,910 --> 03:00:14,920
there and one of the biggest concerns
 

8619
03:00:14,920 --> 03:00:16,630
there and one of the biggest concerns
that we had is like do they migrate and

8620
03:00:16,630 --> 03:00:16,640
that we had is like do they migrate and
 

8621
03:00:16,640 --> 03:00:18,269
that we had is like do they migrate and
do they get to a point where they should

8622
03:00:18,269 --> 03:00:18,279
do they get to a point where they should
 

8623
03:00:18,279 --> 03:00:20,550
do they get to a point where they should
not be we haven't seen that again once

8624
03:00:20,550 --> 03:00:20,560
not be we haven't seen that again once
 

8625
03:00:20,560 --> 03:00:22,950
not be we haven't seen that again once
the scar tissue forms they get anchored

8626
03:00:22,950 --> 03:00:22,960
the scar tissue forms they get anchored
 

8627
03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:26,429
the scar tissue forms they get anchored
in place and I I should also say that

8628
03:00:26,429 --> 03:00:26,439
in place and I I should also say that
 

8629
03:00:26,439 --> 03:00:28,510
in place and I I should also say that
you know when we say upgrades like it

8630
03:00:28,510 --> 03:00:28,520
you know when we say upgrades like it
 

8631
03:00:28,520 --> 03:00:30,429
you know when we say upgrades like it
it's not we're not just talking in

8632
03:00:30,429 --> 03:00:30,439
it's not we're not just talking in
 

8633
03:00:30,439 --> 03:00:32,750
it's not we're not just talking in
theory here like we've actually upgraded

8634
03:00:32,750 --> 03:00:32,760
theory here like we've actually upgraded
 

8635
03:00:32,760 --> 03:00:36,429
theory here like we've actually upgraded
many many times um most of our uh

8636
03:00:36,429 --> 03:00:36,439
many many times um most of our uh
 

8637
03:00:36,439 --> 03:00:39,710
many many times um most of our uh
monkeys or non-human primates nhp have

8638
03:00:39,710 --> 03:00:39,720
monkeys or non-human primates nhp have
 

8639
03:00:39,720 --> 03:00:42,030
monkeys or non-human primates nhp have
been upgraded you know pager who you saw

8640
03:00:42,030 --> 03:00:42,040
been upgraded you know pager who you saw
 

8641
03:00:42,040 --> 03:00:44,550
been upgraded you know pager who you saw
playing mine pong has the latest version

8642
03:00:44,550 --> 03:00:44,560
playing mine pong has the latest version
 

8643
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:47,269
playing mine pong has the latest version
of the device since two years ago and is

8644
03:00:47,269 --> 03:00:47,279
of the device since two years ago and is
 

8645
03:00:47,279 --> 03:00:49,990
of the device since two years ago and is
seemingly very happy and healthy and

8646
03:00:49,990 --> 03:00:50,000
seemingly very happy and healthy and
 

8647
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,710
seemingly very happy and healthy and
fat so what's uh designed for the future

8648
03:00:53,710 --> 03:00:53,720
fat so what's uh designed for the future
 

8649
03:00:53,720 --> 03:01:00,750
fat so what's uh designed for the future
the upgrade procedure so uh maybe uh for

8650
03:01:00,750 --> 03:01:00,760
the upgrade procedure so uh maybe uh for
 

8651
03:01:00,760 --> 03:01:03,190
the upgrade procedure so uh maybe uh for
Nolan what what would the upgrade look

8652
03:01:03,190 --> 03:01:03,200
Nolan what what would the upgrade look
 

8653
03:01:03,200 --> 03:01:04,710
Nolan what what would the upgrade look
like it was essenti what you're

8654
03:01:04,710 --> 03:01:04,720
like it was essenti what you're
 

8655
03:01:04,720 --> 03:01:07,870
like it was essenti what you're
mentioning is there a way to upgrade

8656
03:01:07,870 --> 03:01:07,880
mentioning is there a way to upgrade
 

8657
03:01:07,880 --> 03:01:10,590
mentioning is there a way to upgrade
sort of the device internally where you

8658
03:01:10,590 --> 03:01:10,600
sort of the device internally where you
 

8659
03:01:10,600 --> 03:01:12,830
sort of the device internally where you
take it apart sort of uh keep the

8660
03:01:12,830 --> 03:01:12,840
take it apart sort of uh keep the
 

8661
03:01:12,840 --> 03:01:15,150
take it apart sort of uh keep the
capsule and upgrade the internals yeah

8662
03:01:15,150 --> 03:01:15,160
capsule and upgrade the internals yeah
 

8663
03:01:15,160 --> 03:01:16,469
capsule and upgrade the internals yeah
so there there a couple different things

8664
03:01:16,469 --> 03:01:16,479
so there there a couple different things
 

8665
03:01:16,479 --> 03:01:18,790
so there there a couple different things
here so for Nolan if we were to upgrade

8666
03:01:18,790 --> 03:01:18,800
here so for Nolan if we were to upgrade
 

8667
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:20,830
here so for Nolan if we were to upgrade
what we would have to do is um either

8668
03:01:20,830 --> 03:01:20,840
what we would have to do is um either
 

8669
03:01:20,840 --> 03:01:22,790
what we would have to do is um either
cut the threads or you know extract the

8670
03:01:22,790 --> 03:01:22,800
cut the threads or you know extract the
 

8671
03:01:22,800 --> 03:01:25,469
cut the threads or you know extract the
threads depending on kind of um you know

8672
03:01:25,469 --> 03:01:25,479
threads depending on kind of um you know
 

8673
03:01:25,479 --> 03:01:27,670
threads depending on kind of um you know
uh the situation there in terms of how

8674
03:01:27,670 --> 03:01:27,680
uh the situation there in terms of how
 

8675
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:30,670
uh the situation there in terms of how
they're anchored or scarred in um if you

8676
03:01:30,670 --> 03:01:30,680
they're anchored or scarred in um if you
 

8677
03:01:30,680 --> 03:01:32,710
they're anchored or scarred in um if you
were to remove them with the Dural

8678
03:01:32,710 --> 03:01:32,720
were to remove them with the Dural
 

8679
03:01:32,720 --> 03:01:34,590
were to remove them with the Dural
substitute um you know you have an

8680
03:01:34,590 --> 03:01:34,600
substitute um you know you have an
 

8681
03:01:34,600 --> 03:01:36,630
substitute um you know you have an
intact brain so you can reinsert

8682
03:01:36,630 --> 03:01:36,640
intact brain so you can reinsert
 

8683
03:01:36,640 --> 03:01:39,349
intact brain so you can reinsert
different threads um with the updated uh

8684
03:01:39,349 --> 03:01:39,359
different threads um with the updated uh
 

8685
03:01:39,359 --> 03:01:40,469
different threads um with the updated uh
implant

8686
03:01:40,469 --> 03:01:40,479
implant
 

8687
03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:43,070
implant
package uh there are couple

8688
03:01:43,070 --> 03:01:43,080
package uh there are couple
 

8689
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:46,870
package uh there are couple
different other uh ways that we're

8690
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:46,880
different other uh ways that we're
 

8691
03:01:46,880 --> 03:01:48,349
different other uh ways that we're
thinking about the future

8692
03:01:48,349 --> 03:01:48,359
thinking about the future
 

8693
03:01:48,359 --> 03:01:50,030
thinking about the future
of what the upgradeable system looks

8694
03:01:50,030 --> 03:01:50,040
of what the upgradeable system looks
 

8695
03:01:50,040 --> 03:01:53,469
of what the upgradeable system looks
like one is you know at the moment we

8696
03:01:53,469 --> 03:01:53,479
like one is you know at the moment we
 

8697
03:01:53,479 --> 03:01:55,910
like one is you know at the moment we
currently remove the dura um this this

8698
03:01:55,910 --> 03:01:55,920
currently remove the dura um this this
 

8699
03:01:55,920 --> 03:01:58,150
currently remove the dura um this this
kind of thick layer that protects the

8700
03:01:58,150 --> 03:01:58,160
kind of thick layer that protects the
 

8701
03:01:58,160 --> 03:02:00,070
kind of thick layer that protects the
the brain but that actually is a thing

8702
03:02:00,070 --> 03:02:00,080
the brain but that actually is a thing
 

8703
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:01,830
the brain but that actually is a thing
that actually proliferates the scar

8704
03:02:01,830 --> 03:02:01,840
that actually proliferates the scar
 

8705
03:02:01,840 --> 03:02:04,309
that actually proliferates the scar
tissue formation so typically the

8706
03:02:04,309 --> 03:02:04,319
tissue formation so typically the
 

8707
03:02:04,319 --> 03:02:05,630
tissue formation so typically the
general good rule of thumb is you want

8708
03:02:05,630 --> 03:02:05,640
general good rule of thumb is you want
 

8709
03:02:05,640 --> 03:02:08,510
general good rule of thumb is you want
to leave the the nature as is uh and not

8710
03:02:08,510 --> 03:02:08,520
to leave the the nature as is uh and not
 

8711
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:10,269
to leave the the nature as is uh and not
disrupt it as much so we're looking at

8712
03:02:10,269 --> 03:02:10,279
disrupt it as much so we're looking at
 

8713
03:02:10,279 --> 03:02:13,070
disrupt it as much so we're looking at
ways to uh insert the threads through

8714
03:02:13,070 --> 03:02:13,080
ways to uh insert the threads through
 

8715
03:02:13,080 --> 03:02:16,070
ways to uh insert the threads through
the dura um which comes with different

8716
03:02:16,070 --> 03:02:16,080
the dura um which comes with different
 

8717
03:02:16,080 --> 03:02:18,710
the dura um which comes with different
set of challenges such as

8718
03:02:18,710 --> 03:02:18,720
set of challenges such as
 

8719
03:02:18,720 --> 03:02:20,990
set of challenges such as
you know it's a pretty thick uh layer so

8720
03:02:20,990 --> 03:02:21,000
you know it's a pretty thick uh layer so
 

8721
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:22,030
you know it's a pretty thick uh layer so
how do you actually penetrate that

8722
03:02:22,030 --> 03:02:22,040
how do you actually penetrate that
 

8723
03:02:22,040 --> 03:02:23,469
how do you actually penetrate that
without breaking the needle so we're

8724
03:02:23,469 --> 03:02:23,479
without breaking the needle so we're
 

8725
03:02:23,479 --> 03:02:25,429
without breaking the needle so we're
looking at different needle design for

8726
03:02:25,429 --> 03:02:25,439
looking at different needle design for
 

8727
03:02:25,439 --> 03:02:27,229
looking at different needle design for
that as well as the kind of the loop

8728
03:02:27,229 --> 03:02:27,239
that as well as the kind of the loop
 

8729
03:02:27,239 --> 03:02:29,550
that as well as the kind of the loop
engagement the other biggest challenges

8730
03:02:29,550 --> 03:02:29,560
engagement the other biggest challenges
 

8731
03:02:29,560 --> 03:02:32,349
engagement the other biggest challenges
are it's quite opaque optically in with

8732
03:02:32,349 --> 03:02:32,359
are it's quite opaque optically in with
 

8733
03:02:32,359 --> 03:02:34,950
are it's quite opaque optically in with
white light illumination so how do you

8734
03:02:34,950 --> 03:02:34,960
white light illumination so how do you
 

8735
03:02:34,960 --> 03:02:37,870
white light illumination so how do you
avoid still this this biggest advantage

8736
03:02:37,870 --> 03:02:37,880
avoid still this this biggest advantage
 

8737
03:02:37,880 --> 03:02:40,030
avoid still this this biggest advantage
that we have of avoiding basc Shure U

8738
03:02:40,030 --> 03:02:40,040
that we have of avoiding basc Shure U
 

8739
03:02:40,040 --> 03:02:41,309
that we have of avoiding basc Shure U
how do you image through that how do you

8740
03:02:41,309 --> 03:02:41,319
how do you image through that how do you
 

8741
03:02:41,319 --> 03:02:42,670
how do you image through that how do you
actually still mediate that so there are

8742
03:02:42,670 --> 03:02:42,680
actually still mediate that so there are
 

8743
03:02:42,680 --> 03:02:44,110
actually still mediate that so there are
other Imaging techniques that we're

8744
03:02:44,110 --> 03:02:44,120
other Imaging techniques that we're
 

8745
03:02:44,120 --> 03:02:46,510
other Imaging techniques that we're
looking at to enable that um but the

8746
03:02:46,510 --> 03:02:46,520
looking at to enable that um but the
 

8747
03:02:46,520 --> 03:02:49,150
looking at to enable that um but the
goal the our hypo IIs is that and based

8748
03:02:49,150 --> 03:02:49,160
goal the our hypo IIs is that and based
 

8749
03:02:49,160 --> 03:02:50,830
goal the our hypo IIs is that and based
on some of the early evidence that we

8750
03:02:50,830 --> 03:02:50,840
on some of the early evidence that we
 

8751
03:02:50,840 --> 03:02:53,269
on some of the early evidence that we
have uh doing through the dura insertion

8752
03:02:53,269 --> 03:02:53,279
have uh doing through the dura insertion
 

8753
03:02:53,279 --> 03:02:55,630
have uh doing through the dura insertion
will cause minimal scarring that causes

8754
03:02:55,630 --> 03:02:55,640
will cause minimal scarring that causes
 

8755
03:02:55,640 --> 03:02:57,950
will cause minimal scarring that causes
them to be much easier to extract over

8756
03:02:57,950 --> 03:02:57,960
them to be much easier to extract over
 

8757
03:02:57,960 --> 03:02:59,990
them to be much easier to extract over
time and the other thing that we're also

8758
03:02:59,990 --> 03:03:00,000
time and the other thing that we're also
 

8759
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,469
time and the other thing that we're also
looking at this is um going to be a

8760
03:03:02,469 --> 03:03:02,479
looking at this is um going to be a
 

8761
03:03:02,479 --> 03:03:04,429
looking at this is um going to be a
fundamental change in the implant

8762
03:03:04,429 --> 03:03:04,439
fundamental change in the implant
 

8763
03:03:04,439 --> 03:03:07,830
fundamental change in the implant
architecture is as a at the moment it's

8764
03:03:07,830 --> 03:03:07,840
architecture is as a at the moment it's
 

8765
03:03:07,840 --> 03:03:10,110
architecture is as a at the moment it's
a monolithic single implant that comes

8766
03:03:10,110 --> 03:03:10,120
a monolithic single implant that comes
 

8767
03:03:10,120 --> 03:03:12,750
a monolithic single implant that comes
with a thread that's um bonded together

8768
03:03:12,750 --> 03:03:12,760
with a thread that's um bonded together
 

8769
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:14,030
with a thread that's um bonded together
so you can't actually separate the thing

8770
03:03:14,030 --> 03:03:14,040
so you can't actually separate the thing
 

8771
03:03:14,040 --> 03:03:16,229
so you can't actually separate the thing
out but you can imagine having two-part

8772
03:03:16,229 --> 03:03:16,239
out but you can imagine having two-part
 

8773
03:03:16,239 --> 03:03:19,030
out but you can imagine having two-part
implant um you know bottom part that is

8774
03:03:19,030 --> 03:03:19,040
implant um you know bottom part that is
 

8775
03:03:19,040 --> 03:03:21,150
implant um you know bottom part that is
the thread that are inserted that has

8776
03:03:21,150 --> 03:03:21,160
the thread that are inserted that has
 

8777
03:03:21,160 --> 03:03:24,349
the thread that are inserted that has
the chips um and maybe a radio and some

8778
03:03:24,349 --> 03:03:24,359
the chips um and maybe a radio and some
 

8779
03:03:24,359 --> 03:03:26,670
the chips um and maybe a radio and some
power source and then you have another

8780
03:03:26,670 --> 03:03:26,680
power source and then you have another
 

8781
03:03:26,680 --> 03:03:28,309
power source and then you have another
implant that has more of the

8782
03:03:28,309 --> 03:03:28,319
implant that has more of the
 

8783
03:03:28,319 --> 03:03:30,030
implant that has more of the
computational heavy load and and the

8784
03:03:30,030 --> 03:03:30,040
computational heavy load and and the
 

8785
03:03:30,040 --> 03:03:32,389
computational heavy load and and the
bigger battery um and then one can be

8786
03:03:32,389 --> 03:03:32,399
bigger battery um and then one can be
 

8787
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:34,510
bigger battery um and then one can be
under the D one can be above the D like

8788
03:03:34,510 --> 03:03:34,520
under the D one can be above the D like
 

8789
03:03:34,520 --> 03:03:36,429
under the D one can be above the D like
you know being the plug for the skull

8790
03:03:36,429 --> 03:03:36,439
you know being the plug for the skull
 

8791
03:03:36,439 --> 03:03:37,750
you know being the plug for the skull
they can talk to each other but the

8792
03:03:37,750 --> 03:03:37,760
they can talk to each other but the
 

8793
03:03:37,760 --> 03:03:38,950
they can talk to each other but the
thing that you want to upgrade the

8794
03:03:38,950 --> 03:03:38,960
thing that you want to upgrade the
 

8795
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:41,349
thing that you want to upgrade the
computer and not the threads if you want

8796
03:03:41,349 --> 03:03:41,359
computer and not the threads if you want
 

8797
03:03:41,359 --> 03:03:42,830
computer and not the threads if you want
to upgrade that you just go in there you

8798
03:03:42,830 --> 03:03:42,840
to upgrade that you just go in there you
 

8799
03:03:42,840 --> 03:03:44,870
to upgrade that you just go in there you
know remove the screws and then put in

8800
03:03:44,870 --> 03:03:44,880
know remove the screws and then put in
 

8801
03:03:44,880 --> 03:03:46,670
know remove the screws and then put in
the next version and you know you're off

8802
03:03:46,670 --> 03:03:46,680
the next version and you know you're off
 

8803
03:03:46,680 --> 03:03:48,389
the next version and you know you're off
the you know it's a very very easy

8804
03:03:48,389 --> 03:03:48,399
the you know it's a very very easy
 

8805
03:03:48,399 --> 03:03:50,590
the you know it's a very very easy
surgery too like you do a skin incision

8806
03:03:50,590 --> 03:03:50,600
surgery too like you do a skin incision
 

8807
03:03:50,600 --> 03:03:53,590
surgery too like you do a skin incision
slip this in screw probably be able to

8808
03:03:53,590 --> 03:03:53,600
slip this in screw probably be able to
 

8809
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:55,630
slip this in screw probably be able to
do this in 10 minutes so that would

8810
03:03:55,630 --> 03:03:55,640
do this in 10 minutes so that would
 

8811
03:03:55,640 --> 03:03:58,269
do this in 10 minutes so that would
allow you to reuse the threads sort of

8812
03:03:58,269 --> 03:03:58,279
allow you to reuse the threads sort of
 

8813
03:03:58,279 --> 03:04:00,349
allow you to reuse the threads sort of
correct so I mean this leads to the

8814
03:04:00,349 --> 03:04:00,359
correct so I mean this leads to the
 

8815
03:04:00,359 --> 03:04:02,309
correct so I mean this leads to the
Natural question of uh what is the

8816
03:04:02,309 --> 03:04:02,319
Natural question of uh what is the
 

8817
03:04:02,319 --> 03:04:04,510
Natural question of uh what is the
pathway to scaling the increase in the

8818
03:04:04,510 --> 03:04:04,520
pathway to scaling the increase in the
 

8819
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:07,630
pathway to scaling the increase in the
number of threads is that a priority is

8820
03:04:07,630 --> 03:04:07,640
number of threads is that a priority is
 

8821
03:04:07,640 --> 03:04:09,630
number of threads is that a priority is
that like what's what's the technical uh

8822
03:04:09,630 --> 03:04:09,640
that like what's what's the technical uh
 

8823
03:04:09,640 --> 03:04:12,070
that like what's what's the technical uh
challenge there yeah that that is a

8824
03:04:12,070 --> 03:04:12,080
challenge there yeah that that is a
 

8825
03:04:12,080 --> 03:04:13,670
challenge there yeah that that is a
priority so for next versions of the

8826
03:04:13,670 --> 03:04:13,680
priority so for next versions of the
 

8827
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:16,309
priority so for next versions of the
implant um you know the key metrics that

8828
03:04:16,309 --> 03:04:16,319
implant um you know the key metrics that
 

8829
03:04:16,319 --> 03:04:18,510
implant um you know the key metrics that
we're looking to improve are number of

8830
03:04:18,510 --> 03:04:18,520
we're looking to improve are number of
 

8831
03:04:18,520 --> 03:04:20,229
we're looking to improve are number of
channels just recording from more and

8832
03:04:20,229 --> 03:04:20,239
channels just recording from more and
 

8833
03:04:20,239 --> 03:04:22,630
channels just recording from more and
more neurons um you know we have a

8834
03:04:22,630 --> 03:04:22,640
more neurons um you know we have a
 

8835
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:24,550
more neurons um you know we have a
pathway to actually go from currently

8836
03:04:24,550 --> 03:04:24,560
pathway to actually go from currently
 

8837
03:04:24,560 --> 03:04:27,309
pathway to actually go from currently
1,000 to you know hopefully 3,000 if not

8838
03:04:27,309 --> 03:04:27,319
1,000 to you know hopefully 3,000 if not
 

8839
03:04:27,319 --> 03:04:30,750
1,000 to you know hopefully 3,000 if not
6,000 by end of this year um wow and

8840
03:04:30,750 --> 03:04:30,760
6,000 by end of this year um wow and
 

8841
03:04:30,760 --> 03:04:32,510
6,000 by end of this year um wow and
then end of next year we want to get to

8842
03:04:32,510 --> 03:04:32,520
then end of next year we want to get to
 

8843
03:04:32,520 --> 03:04:36,950
then end of next year we want to get to
uh you know even more 16,000 wow there a

8844
03:04:36,950 --> 03:04:36,960
uh you know even more 16,000 wow there a
 

8845
03:04:36,960 --> 03:04:38,670
uh you know even more 16,000 wow there a
couple limitations to that one is you

8846
03:04:38,670 --> 03:04:38,680
couple limitations to that one is you
 

8847
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:40,150
couple limitations to that one is you
know obviously being able to photo

8848
03:04:40,150 --> 03:04:40,160
know obviously being able to photo
 

8849
03:04:40,160 --> 03:04:43,110
know obviously being able to photo
lithographically print those wires as I

8850
03:04:43,110 --> 03:04:43,120
lithographically print those wires as I
 

8851
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:45,070
lithographically print those wires as I
mentioned it's two Micron in width and

8852
03:04:45,070 --> 03:04:45,080
mentioned it's two Micron in width and
 

8853
03:04:45,080 --> 03:04:45,910
mentioned it's two Micron in width and
and

8854
03:04:45,910 --> 03:04:45,920
and
 

8855
03:04:45,920 --> 03:04:48,269
and
spacing obviously there are chips that

8856
03:04:48,269 --> 03:04:48,279
spacing obviously there are chips that
 

8857
03:04:48,279 --> 03:04:50,190
spacing obviously there are chips that
are much more advanced than those types

8858
03:04:50,190 --> 03:04:50,200
are much more advanced than those types
 

8859
03:04:50,200 --> 03:04:51,389
are much more advanced than those types
of resolution and we have some of the

8860
03:04:51,389 --> 03:04:51,399
of resolution and we have some of the
 

8861
03:04:51,399 --> 03:04:53,429
of resolution and we have some of the
tools that we have brought in house to

8862
03:04:53,429 --> 03:04:53,439
tools that we have brought in house to
 

8863
03:04:53,439 --> 03:04:56,269
tools that we have brought in house to
be able to do that so traces will be

8864
03:04:56,269 --> 03:04:56,279
be able to do that so traces will be
 

8865
03:04:56,279 --> 03:04:58,070
be able to do that so traces will be
narrower just so that you have to have

8866
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,080
narrower just so that you have to have
 

8867
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:00,309
narrower just so that you have to have
more of the wires coming up into the

8868
03:05:00,309 --> 03:05:00,319
more of the wires coming up into the
 

8869
03:05:00,319 --> 03:05:02,389
more of the wires coming up into the
chip

8870
03:05:02,389 --> 03:05:02,399
chip
 

8871
03:05:02,399 --> 03:05:06,469
chip
um chips also cannot linearly consume

8872
03:05:06,469 --> 03:05:06,479
um chips also cannot linearly consume
 

8873
03:05:06,479 --> 03:05:08,349
um chips also cannot linearly consume
more energy as you have more and more

8874
03:05:08,349 --> 03:05:08,359
more energy as you have more and more
 

8875
03:05:08,359 --> 03:05:10,070
more energy as you have more and more
channels so there's a lot of Innovations

8876
03:05:10,070 --> 03:05:10,080
channels so there's a lot of Innovations
 

8877
03:05:10,080 --> 03:05:12,630
channels so there's a lot of Innovations
in the circuit um you know and

8878
03:05:12,630 --> 03:05:12,640
in the circuit um you know and
 

8879
03:05:12,640 --> 03:05:14,150
in the circuit um you know and
architecture as as well as a circuit

8880
03:05:14,150 --> 03:05:14,160
architecture as as well as a circuit
 

8881
03:05:14,160 --> 03:05:16,870
architecture as as well as a circuit
design topology to make them lower power

8882
03:05:16,870 --> 03:05:16,880
design topology to make them lower power
 

8883
03:05:16,880 --> 03:05:18,630
design topology to make them lower power
um you need to also think about if you

8884
03:05:18,630 --> 03:05:18,640
um you need to also think about if you
 

8885
03:05:18,640 --> 03:05:20,990
um you need to also think about if you
have all of these spikes how do you send

8886
03:05:20,990 --> 03:05:21,000
have all of these spikes how do you send
 

8887
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,030
have all of these spikes how do you send
that off to the end application so you

8888
03:05:23,030 --> 03:05:23,040
that off to the end application so you
 

8889
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:25,030
that off to the end application so you
need to think about bandwidth limitation

8890
03:05:25,030 --> 03:05:25,040
need to think about bandwidth limitation
 

8891
03:05:25,040 --> 03:05:26,510
need to think about bandwidth limitation
there and potentially Innovations and

8892
03:05:26,510 --> 03:05:26,520
there and potentially Innovations and
 

8893
03:05:26,520 --> 03:05:29,910
there and potentially Innovations and
Signal processing um physically one of

8894
03:05:29,910 --> 03:05:29,920
Signal processing um physically one of
 

8895
03:05:29,920 --> 03:05:32,429
Signal processing um physically one of
the biggest challenges is going to be um

8896
03:05:32,429 --> 03:05:32,439
the biggest challenges is going to be um
 

8897
03:05:32,439 --> 03:05:34,750
the biggest challenges is going to be um
the the the the interface it's always

8898
03:05:34,750 --> 03:05:34,760
the the the the interface it's always
 

8899
03:05:34,760 --> 03:05:37,110
the the the the interface it's always
the interface that breaks um bonding the

8900
03:05:37,110 --> 03:05:37,120
the interface that breaks um bonding the
 

8901
03:05:37,120 --> 03:05:40,710
the interface that breaks um bonding the
thin FM array to the um the electronics

8902
03:05:40,710 --> 03:05:40,720
thin FM array to the um the electronics
 

8903
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:42,790
thin FM array to the um the electronics
um it starts to become very very highly

8904
03:05:42,790 --> 03:05:42,800
um it starts to become very very highly
 

8905
03:05:42,800 --> 03:05:44,510
um it starts to become very very highly
dense uh interconnects so how do you

8906
03:05:44,510 --> 03:05:44,520
dense uh interconnects so how do you
 

8907
03:05:44,520 --> 03:05:46,110
dense uh interconnects so how do you
connector Rize that there's a lot of

8908
03:05:46,110 --> 03:05:46,120
connector Rize that there's a lot of
 

8909
03:05:46,120 --> 03:05:48,590
connector Rize that there's a lot of
Innovations um in in kind of the 3D

8910
03:05:48,590 --> 03:05:48,600
Innovations um in in kind of the 3D
 

8911
03:05:48,600 --> 03:05:51,630

Integrations in the recent years that we

8912
03:05:51,630 --> 03:05:51,640
Integrations in the recent years that we
 

8913
03:05:51,640 --> 03:05:53,870
Integrations in the recent years that we
can take advantage of um one of the

8914
03:05:53,870 --> 03:05:53,880
can take advantage of um one of the
 

8915
03:05:53,880 --> 03:05:56,349
can take advantage of um one of the
biggest challenges that we do have is

8916
03:05:56,349 --> 03:05:56,359
biggest challenges that we do have is
 

8917
03:05:56,359 --> 03:05:58,269
biggest challenges that we do have is
you know forming this hermetic barrier

8918
03:05:58,269 --> 03:05:58,279
you know forming this hermetic barrier
 

8919
03:05:58,279 --> 03:06:00,070
you know forming this hermetic barrier
right you know this is an extremely

8920
03:06:00,070 --> 03:06:00,080
right you know this is an extremely
 

8921
03:06:00,080 --> 03:06:01,510
right you know this is an extremely
harsh environment that we're in the

8922
03:06:01,510 --> 03:06:01,520
harsh environment that we're in the
 

8923
03:06:01,520 --> 03:06:05,550
harsh environment that we're in the
brain um so how do you protect it from

8924
03:06:05,550 --> 03:06:05,560
brain um so how do you protect it from
 

8925
03:06:05,560 --> 03:06:08,510
brain um so how do you protect it from
uh yeah like the brain trying to kill

8926
03:06:08,510 --> 03:06:08,520
uh yeah like the brain trying to kill
 

8927
03:06:08,520 --> 03:06:10,429
uh yeah like the brain trying to kill
your electronics to also your

8928
03:06:10,429 --> 03:06:10,439
your electronics to also your
 

8929
03:06:10,439 --> 03:06:12,229
your electronics to also your
electronics leaking things that you

8930
03:06:12,229 --> 03:06:12,239
electronics leaking things that you
 

8931
03:06:12,239 --> 03:06:13,750
electronics leaking things that you
don't want into the brain and that

8932
03:06:13,750 --> 03:06:13,760
don't want into the brain and that
 

8933
03:06:13,760 --> 03:06:15,229
don't want into the brain and that
forming that hermetic barrier is going

8934
03:06:15,229 --> 03:06:15,239
forming that hermetic barrier is going
 

8935
03:06:15,239 --> 03:06:17,150
forming that hermetic barrier is going
to be a very very big challenge that we

8936
03:06:17,150 --> 03:06:17,160
to be a very very big challenge that we
 

8937
03:06:17,160 --> 03:06:19,190
to be a very very big challenge that we
uh you know I think are actually well

8938
03:06:19,190 --> 03:06:19,200
uh you know I think are actually well
 

8939
03:06:19,200 --> 03:06:21,550
uh you know I think are actually well
suited to tackle how do you test that

8940
03:06:21,550 --> 03:06:21,560
suited to tackle how do you test that
 

8941
03:06:21,560 --> 03:06:23,550
suited to tackle how do you test that
like what's the development environment

8942
03:06:23,550 --> 03:06:23,560
like what's the development environment
 

8943
03:06:23,560 --> 03:06:25,910
like what's the development environment
yeah to simulate that kind of harshness

8944
03:06:25,910 --> 03:06:25,920
yeah to simulate that kind of harshness
 

8945
03:06:25,920 --> 03:06:27,469
yeah to simulate that kind of harshness
yeah so this is this is where the

8946
03:06:27,469 --> 03:06:27,479
yeah so this is this is where the
 

8947
03:06:27,479 --> 03:06:29,830
yeah so this is this is where the
accelerated life tester essentially is a

8948
03:06:29,830 --> 03:06:29,840
accelerated life tester essentially is a
 

8949
03:06:29,840 --> 03:06:32,950
accelerated life tester essentially is a
brain inovat mhm uh it literally is a

8950
03:06:32,950 --> 03:06:32,960
brain inovat mhm uh it literally is a
 

8951
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:36,510
brain inovat mhm uh it literally is a
vessel that is um made up of and again

8952
03:06:36,510 --> 03:06:36,520
vessel that is um made up of and again
 

8953
03:06:36,520 --> 03:06:39,030
vessel that is um made up of and again
again for all intents and purpose for

8954
03:06:39,030 --> 03:06:39,040
again for all intents and purpose for
 

8955
03:06:39,040 --> 03:06:41,349
again for all intents and purpose for
this particular types of test your brain

8956
03:06:41,349 --> 03:06:41,359
this particular types of test your brain
 

8957
03:06:41,359 --> 03:06:47,950
this particular types of test your brain
is a saltwater MH and uh and you can uh

8958
03:06:47,950 --> 03:06:47,960
is a saltwater MH and uh and you can uh
 

8959
03:06:47,960 --> 03:06:49,510
is a saltwater MH and uh and you can uh
also put some other set of chemicals

8960
03:06:49,510 --> 03:06:49,520
also put some other set of chemicals
 

8961
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:51,469
also put some other set of chemicals
like reactive oxygen species that you

8962
03:06:51,469 --> 03:06:51,479
like reactive oxygen species that you
 

8963
03:06:51,479 --> 03:06:53,510
like reactive oxygen species that you
know get at kind of these interfaces and

8964
03:06:53,510 --> 03:06:53,520
know get at kind of these interfaces and
 

8965
03:06:53,520 --> 03:06:57,710
know get at kind of these interfaces and
trying to cause a reaction to to uh pull

8966
03:06:57,710 --> 03:06:57,720
trying to cause a reaction to to uh pull
 

8967
03:06:57,720 --> 03:07:00,990
trying to cause a reaction to to uh pull
it apart but you could also increase the

8968
03:07:00,990 --> 03:07:01,000
it apart but you could also increase the
 

8969
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,550
it apart but you could also increase the
rate at which these uh interfaces are

8970
03:07:03,550 --> 03:07:03,560
rate at which these uh interfaces are
 

8971
03:07:03,560 --> 03:07:05,190
rate at which these uh interfaces are
aging by just increasing

8972
03:07:05,190 --> 03:07:05,200
aging by just increasing
 

8973
03:07:05,200 --> 03:07:07,710
aging by just increasing
temperature so every 10 degre Celsius

8974
03:07:07,710 --> 03:07:07,720
temperature so every 10 degre Celsius
 

8975
03:07:07,720 --> 03:07:09,110
temperature so every 10 degre Celsius
that you increase you're basically

8976
03:07:09,110 --> 03:07:09,120
that you increase you're basically
 

8977
03:07:09,120 --> 03:07:10,750
that you increase you're basically
accelerating Time by

8978
03:07:10,750 --> 03:07:10,760
accelerating Time by
 

8979
03:07:10,760 --> 03:07:13,429
accelerating Time by
2X and there's limit as to how how much

8980
03:07:13,429 --> 03:07:13,439
2X and there's limit as to how how much
 

8981
03:07:13,439 --> 03:07:14,790
2X and there's limit as to how how much
temperature you want to increase CU at

8982
03:07:14,790 --> 03:07:14,800
temperature you want to increase CU at
 

8983
03:07:14,800 --> 03:07:16,910
temperature you want to increase CU at
some point there's some other nonlinear

8984
03:07:16,910 --> 03:07:16,920
some point there's some other nonlinear
 

8985
03:07:16,920 --> 03:07:19,790
some point there's some other nonlinear
dynamics that that causes you to have

8986
03:07:19,790 --> 03:07:19,800
dynamics that that causes you to have
 

8987
03:07:19,800 --> 03:07:22,110
dynamics that that causes you to have
other nasty gases to form that just is

8988
03:07:22,110 --> 03:07:22,120
other nasty gases to form that just is
 

8989
03:07:22,120 --> 03:07:24,190
other nasty gases to form that just is
not realistic in an environment so what

8990
03:07:24,190 --> 03:07:24,200
not realistic in an environment so what
 

8991
03:07:24,200 --> 03:07:26,870
not realistic in an environment so what
we do is we increase uh in our alt

8992
03:07:26,870 --> 03:07:26,880
we do is we increase uh in our alt
 

8993
03:07:26,880 --> 03:07:30,950
we do is we increase uh in our alt
chamber by 20° celius that uh increases

8994
03:07:30,950 --> 03:07:30,960
chamber by 20° celius that uh increases
 

8995
03:07:30,960 --> 03:07:33,349
chamber by 20° celius that uh increases
the Aging by four four times so

8996
03:07:33,349 --> 03:07:33,359
the Aging by four four times so
 

8997
03:07:33,359 --> 03:07:35,670
the Aging by four four times so
essentially one day in alt chamber is 4

8998
03:07:35,670 --> 03:07:35,680
essentially one day in alt chamber is 4
 

8999
03:07:35,680 --> 03:07:38,150
essentially one day in alt chamber is 4
day in calendar year and and we look at

9000
03:07:38,150 --> 03:07:38,160
day in calendar year and and we look at
 

9001
03:07:38,160 --> 03:07:42,110
day in calendar year and and we look at
whether the implants still are intact uh

9002
03:07:42,110 --> 03:07:42,120
whether the implants still are intact uh
 

9003
03:07:42,120 --> 03:07:44,269
whether the implants still are intact uh
including the threats and and operation

9004
03:07:44,269 --> 03:07:44,279
including the threats and and operation
 

9005
03:07:44,279 --> 03:07:46,030
including the threats and and operation
and all that and operation and all of

9006
03:07:46,030 --> 03:07:46,040
and all that and operation and all of
 

9007
03:07:46,040 --> 03:07:48,670
and all that and operation and all of
that um it obviously is not an exact

9008
03:07:48,670 --> 03:07:48,680
that um it obviously is not an exact
 

9009
03:07:48,680 --> 03:07:50,070
that um it obviously is not an exact
same environment as a brain because you

9010
03:07:50,070 --> 03:07:50,080
same environment as a brain because you
 

9011
03:07:50,080 --> 03:07:52,950
same environment as a brain because you
know brain has mechanical you know other

9012
03:07:52,950 --> 03:07:52,960
know brain has mechanical you know other
 

9013
03:07:52,960 --> 03:07:56,030
know brain has mechanical you know other
more uh biological gops that that attack

9014
03:07:56,030 --> 03:07:56,040
more uh biological gops that that attack
 

9015
03:07:56,040 --> 03:07:58,750
more uh biological gops that that attack
at it um but it is a good test

9016
03:07:58,750 --> 03:07:58,760
at it um but it is a good test
 

9017
03:07:58,760 --> 03:08:00,229
at it um but it is a good test
environment testing environment for at

9018
03:08:00,229 --> 03:08:00,239
environment testing environment for at
 

9019
03:08:00,239 --> 03:08:02,790
environment testing environment for at
least the the the enclosure and the

9020
03:08:02,790 --> 03:08:02,800
least the the the enclosure and the
 

9021
03:08:02,800 --> 03:08:05,229
least the the the enclosure and the
strength of the enclosure and I mean

9022
03:08:05,229 --> 03:08:05,239
strength of the enclosure and I mean
 

9023
03:08:05,239 --> 03:08:07,630
strength of the enclosure and I mean
we've had implants the current version

9024
03:08:07,630 --> 03:08:07,640
we've had implants the current version
 

9025
03:08:07,640 --> 03:08:10,150
we've had implants the current version
of the implant that has been in there

9026
03:08:10,150 --> 03:08:10,160
of the implant that has been in there
 

9027
03:08:10,160 --> 03:08:13,229
of the implant that has been in there
for I mean close to two and a half years

9028
03:08:13,229 --> 03:08:13,239
for I mean close to two and a half years
 

9029
03:08:13,239 --> 03:08:15,269
for I mean close to two and a half years
which is equivalent to a decade and they

9030
03:08:15,269 --> 03:08:15,279
which is equivalent to a decade and they
 

9031
03:08:15,279 --> 03:08:17,870
which is equivalent to a decade and they
seem to be fine

9032
03:08:17,870 --> 03:08:17,880
seem to be fine
 

9033
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:20,190
seem to be fine
so it's interesting that the so

9034
03:08:20,190 --> 03:08:20,200
so it's interesting that the so
 

9035
03:08:20,200 --> 03:08:24,870
so it's interesting that the so
basically uh close approximation is warm

9036
03:08:24,870 --> 03:08:24,880
basically uh close approximation is warm
 

9037
03:08:24,880 --> 03:08:26,830
basically uh close approximation is warm
salt water hot salt water is a good

9038
03:08:26,830 --> 03:08:26,840
salt water hot salt water is a good
 

9039
03:08:26,840 --> 03:08:29,510
salt water hot salt water is a good
testing environment I yeah by the way

9040
03:08:29,510 --> 03:08:29,520
testing environment I yeah by the way
 

9041
03:08:29,520 --> 03:08:32,309
testing environment I yeah by the way
I'm drinking element uh which is

9042
03:08:32,309 --> 03:08:32,319
I'm drinking element uh which is
 

9043
03:08:32,319 --> 03:08:35,229
I'm drinking element uh which is
basically salt water which is making me

9044
03:08:35,229 --> 03:08:35,239
basically salt water which is making me
 

9045
03:08:35,239 --> 03:08:37,830
basically salt water which is making me
kind of it doesn't have computational

9046
03:08:37,830 --> 03:08:37,840
kind of it doesn't have computational
 

9047
03:08:37,840 --> 03:08:39,590
kind of it doesn't have computational
power the way the brain does but maybe

9048
03:08:39,590 --> 03:08:39,600
power the way the brain does but maybe
 

9049
03:08:39,600 --> 03:08:42,110
power the way the brain does but maybe
in terms of in terms of all the

9050
03:08:42,110 --> 03:08:42,120
in terms of in terms of all the
 

9051
03:08:42,120 --> 03:08:44,030
in terms of in terms of all the
characteristics is quite similar and I'm

9052
03:08:44,030 --> 03:08:44,040
characteristics is quite similar and I'm
 

9053
03:08:44,040 --> 03:08:45,790
characteristics is quite similar and I'm
consuming it yeah you have to get it in

9054
03:08:45,790 --> 03:08:45,800
consuming it yeah you have to get it in
 

9055
03:08:45,800 --> 03:08:48,750
consuming it yeah you have to get it in
the right pH too

9056
03:08:48,750 --> 03:08:48,760
the right pH too
 

9057
03:08:48,760 --> 03:08:50,910
the right pH too
and then Consciousness will emerge yeah

9058
03:08:50,910 --> 03:08:50,920
and then Consciousness will emerge yeah
 

9059
03:08:50,920 --> 03:08:53,110
and then Consciousness will emerge yeah
no uh all right by the way the other

9060
03:08:53,110 --> 03:08:53,120
no uh all right by the way the other
 

9061
03:08:53,120 --> 03:08:54,910
no uh all right by the way the other
thing that also is interesting about our

9062
03:08:54,910 --> 03:08:54,920
thing that also is interesting about our
 

9063
03:08:54,920 --> 03:08:58,550
thing that also is interesting about our
enclosure is uh if if you look at our

9064
03:08:58,550 --> 03:08:58,560
enclosure is uh if if you look at our
 

9065
03:08:58,560 --> 03:09:02,190

03:09:15,630 --> 03:09:15,640
polychoral Tri floro ethylene which is
 

9075
03:09:15,640 --> 03:09:19,349
polychoral Tri floro ethylene which is
actually commonly used in packs so when

actually commonly used in packs so when
 

9077
03:09:19,359 --> 03:09:21,030
actually commonly used in packs so when
you have a pill and you're try to pop

9078
03:09:21,030 --> 03:09:21,040
you have a pill and you're try to pop
 

9079
03:09:21,040 --> 03:09:22,309
you have a pill and you're try to pop
the pill there's that kind of that

9080
03:09:22,309 --> 03:09:22,319
the pill there's that kind of that
 

9081
03:09:22,319 --> 03:09:24,950
the pill there's that kind of that
plastic membrane that's what this is um

9082
03:09:24,950 --> 03:09:24,960
plastic membrane that's what this is um
 

9083
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:26,750
plastic membrane that's what this is um
no one's actually ever used this uh

9084
03:09:26,750 --> 03:09:26,760
no one's actually ever used this uh
 

9085
03:09:26,760 --> 03:09:29,790
no one's actually ever used this uh
except us and the reason we um wanted to

9086
03:09:29,790 --> 03:09:29,800
except us and the reason we um wanted to
 

9087
03:09:29,800 --> 03:09:30,750
except us and the reason we um wanted to
do this is because it's

9088
03:09:30,750 --> 03:09:30,760
do this is because it's
 

9089
03:09:30,760 --> 03:09:32,830
do this is because it's
electromagnetically transparent so when

9090
03:09:32,830 --> 03:09:32,840
electromagnetically transparent so when
 

9091
03:09:32,840 --> 03:09:35,990
electromagnetically transparent so when
we talked about the uh electromagnetic

9092
03:09:35,990 --> 03:09:36,000
we talked about the uh electromagnetic
 

9093
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,750
we talked about the uh electromagnetic
inductive charging um with titanium can

9094
03:09:38,750 --> 03:09:38,760
inductive charging um with titanium can
 

9095
03:09:38,760 --> 03:09:40,030

usually if you want to do something like

9096
03:09:40,030 --> 03:09:40,040
usually if you want to do something like
 

9097
03:09:40,040 --> 03:09:41,750
usually if you want to do something like
that um you know you have to have a

9098
03:09:41,750 --> 03:09:41,760
that um you know you have to have a
 

9099
03:09:41,760 --> 03:09:43,870
that um you know you have to have a
sapphire window and it's a it's a very

9100
03:09:43,870 --> 03:09:43,880
sapphire window and it's a it's a very
 

9101
03:09:43,880 --> 03:09:45,950
sapphire window and it's a it's a very
very tough process to scale so you're

9102
03:09:45,950 --> 03:09:45,960
very tough process to scale so you're
 

9103
03:09:45,960 --> 03:09:47,590
very tough process to scale so you're
doing a lot of iteration here and every

9104
03:09:47,590 --> 03:09:47,600
doing a lot of iteration here and every
 

9105
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:49,150
doing a lot of iteration here and every
aspect of this the materials the

9106
03:09:49,150 --> 03:09:49,160
aspect of this the materials the
 

9107
03:09:49,160 --> 03:09:52,349

Shang uh so okay so you mentioned

9110
03:09:56,670 --> 03:09:56,680
Shang uh so okay so you mentioned
 

9111
03:09:56,680 --> 03:09:59,349
Shang uh so okay so you mentioned
scaling is it possible to have multiple

9112
03:09:59,349 --> 03:09:59,359
scaling is it possible to have multiple
 

9113
03:09:59,359 --> 03:10:03,030
scaling is it possible to have multiple
neuralink devices as one of the ways of

9114
03:10:03,030 --> 03:10:03,040
neuralink devices as one of the ways of
 

9115
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:05,710
neuralink devices as one of the ways of
scaling to have multiple neuralink

9116
03:10:05,710 --> 03:10:05,720
scaling to have multiple neuralink
 

9117
03:10:05,720 --> 03:10:08,070
scaling to have multiple neuralink
devices implanted that's the goal that's

9118
03:10:08,070 --> 03:10:08,080
devices implanted that's the goal that's
 

9119
03:10:08,080 --> 03:10:10,150
devices implanted that's the goal that's
the goal yeah we we've had we've had um

9120
03:10:10,150 --> 03:10:10,160
the goal yeah we we've had we've had um
 

9121
03:10:10,160 --> 03:10:13,030
the goal yeah we we've had we've had um
I mean our monkeys have had two neural

9122
03:10:13,030 --> 03:10:13,040
I mean our monkeys have had two neural
 

9123
03:10:13,040 --> 03:10:15,950
I mean our monkeys have had two neural
links one in each hemisphere and then

9124
03:10:15,950 --> 03:10:15,960
links one in each hemisphere and then
 

9125
03:10:15,960 --> 03:10:17,710
links one in each hemisphere and then
we're also looking at you know potential

9126
03:10:17,710 --> 03:10:17,720
we're also looking at you know potential
 

9127
03:10:17,720 --> 03:10:20,870
we're also looking at you know potential
of having one in moral cortex one in

9128
03:10:20,870 --> 03:10:20,880
of having one in moral cortex one in
 

9129
03:10:20,880 --> 03:10:23,750
of having one in moral cortex one in
visual cortex and one in whever other

9130
03:10:23,750 --> 03:10:23,760
visual cortex and one in whever other
 

9131
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:26,790
visual cortex and one in whever other
cortex so focusing on the particular

9132
03:10:26,790 --> 03:10:26,800
cortex so focusing on the particular
 

9133
03:10:26,800 --> 03:10:29,349
cortex so focusing on the particular
function one yink device I mean I wonder

9134
03:10:29,349 --> 03:10:29,359
function one yink device I mean I wonder
 

9135
03:10:29,359 --> 03:10:30,910
function one yink device I mean I wonder
if there's some level of customization

9136
03:10:30,910 --> 03:10:30,920
if there's some level of customization
 

9137
03:10:30,920 --> 03:10:32,630
if there's some level of customization
that could be done on the compute side

9138
03:10:32,630 --> 03:10:32,640
that could be done on the compute side
 

9139
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:35,389
that could be done on the compute side
so for the motor cortex absolutely that

9140
03:10:35,389 --> 03:10:35,399
so for the motor cortex absolutely that
 

9141
03:10:35,399 --> 03:10:36,870
so for the motor cortex absolutely that
that's the goal and and you know we talk

9142
03:10:36,870 --> 03:10:36,880
that's the goal and and you know we talk
 

9143
03:10:36,880 --> 03:10:38,830
that's the goal and and you know we talk
about at neuralink building a

9144
03:10:38,830 --> 03:10:38,840
about at neuralink building a
 

9145
03:10:38,840 --> 03:10:40,870
about at neuralink building a
generalized neural interface to the

9146
03:10:40,870 --> 03:10:40,880
generalized neural interface to the
 

9147
03:10:40,880 --> 03:10:44,950
generalized neural interface to the
brain um and and that that also is

9148
03:10:44,950 --> 03:10:44,960
brain um and and that that also is
 

9149
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:46,990
brain um and and that that also is
strategically how we're approaching this

9150
03:10:46,990 --> 03:10:47,000
strategically how we're approaching this
 

9151
03:10:47,000 --> 03:10:50,110
strategically how we're approaching this
um with with marketing and also you know

9152
03:10:50,110 --> 03:10:50,120
um with with marketing and also you know
 

9153
03:10:50,120 --> 03:10:53,229
um with with marketing and also you know
with with regulatory which is hey look

9154
03:10:53,229 --> 03:10:53,239
with with regulatory which is hey look
 

9155
03:10:53,239 --> 03:10:56,150
with with regulatory which is hey look
um we have the robot and the robot can

9156
03:10:56,150 --> 03:10:56,160
um we have the robot and the robot can
 

9157
03:10:56,160 --> 03:10:58,030
um we have the robot and the robot can
access any part of the cortex right now

9158
03:10:58,030 --> 03:10:58,040
access any part of the cortex right now
 

9159
03:10:58,040 --> 03:11:00,870
access any part of the cortex right now
we're focused on motor cortex uh with

9160
03:11:00,870 --> 03:11:00,880
we're focused on motor cortex uh with
 

9161
03:11:00,880 --> 03:11:03,870
we're focused on motor cortex uh with
current version of the N1 that's

9162
03:11:03,870 --> 03:11:03,880
current version of the N1 that's
 

9163
03:11:03,880 --> 03:11:06,990
current version of the N1 that's
specialized for motor decoding tasks but

9164
03:11:06,990 --> 03:11:07,000
specialized for motor decoding tasks but
 

9165
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:08,229
specialized for motor decoding tasks but
also at the end of the day there's kind

9166
03:11:08,229 --> 03:11:08,239
also at the end of the day there's kind
 

9167
03:11:08,239 --> 03:11:11,670
also at the end of the day there's kind
of a general compute available there

9168
03:11:11,670 --> 03:11:11,680
of a general compute available there
 

9169
03:11:11,680 --> 03:11:13,950
of a general compute available there
um uh but you know typically if you want

9170
03:11:13,950 --> 03:11:13,960
um uh but you know typically if you want
 

9171
03:11:13,960 --> 03:11:15,790
um uh but you know typically if you want
to really get down to kind of hyper

9172
03:11:15,790 --> 03:11:15,800
to really get down to kind of hyper

03:11:18,910 --> 03:11:18,920
you do want need to get to some
 

9177
03:11:18,920 --> 03:11:22,750
you do want need to get to some
specialized function right um but you

9178
03:11:22,750 --> 03:11:22,760
specialized function right um but you
 

9179
03:11:22,760 --> 03:11:24,670

conversation with the FDA um and also
 

9191
03:11:35,520 --> 03:11:36,990
conversation with the FDA um and also
internally convincing oursel that this

9192
03:11:36,990 --> 03:11:37,000
internally convincing oursel that this
 

9193
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:39,309
internally convincing oursel that this
is this is safe

9194
03:11:39,309 --> 03:11:39,319
is this is safe
 

9195
03:11:39,319 --> 03:11:42,670
is this is safe
and um now the difference is that if we

9196
03:11:42,670 --> 03:11:42,680
and um now the difference is that if we
 

9197
03:11:42,680 --> 03:11:44,309
and um now the difference is that if we
go to other parts of the brain like

9198
03:11:44,309 --> 03:11:44,319
go to other parts of the brain like
 

9199
03:11:44,319 --> 03:11:46,309
go to other parts of the brain like
visual cortex which we're interested in

9200
03:11:46,309 --> 03:11:46,319
visual cortex which we're interested in
 

9201
03:11:46,319 --> 03:11:47,950
visual cortex which we're interested in
as our second product

9202
03:11:47,950 --> 03:11:47,960
as our second product
 

9203
03:11:47,960 --> 03:11:49,590
as our second product
um obviously it's a completely different

9204
03:11:49,590 --> 03:11:49,600
um obviously it's a completely different
 

9205
03:11:49,600 --> 03:11:51,950
um obviously it's a completely different
environment the cortex is laid out very

9206
03:11:51,950 --> 03:11:51,960
environment the cortex is laid out very
 

9207
03:11:51,960 --> 03:11:54,710
environment the cortex is laid out very
very differently um you know it's going

9208
03:11:54,710 --> 03:11:54,720
very differently um you know it's going
 

9209
03:11:54,720 --> 03:11:56,590
very differently um you know it's going
to be more stimulation Focus rather than

9210
03:11:56,590 --> 03:11:56,600
to be more stimulation Focus rather than
 

9211
03:11:56,600 --> 03:11:58,630
to be more stimulation Focus rather than
recording um just just kind of creating

9212
03:11:58,630 --> 03:11:58,640
recording um just just kind of creating
 

9213
03:11:58,640 --> 03:12:01,269
recording um just just kind of creating
visual percepts but in the end we're

9214
03:12:01,269 --> 03:12:01,279
visual percepts but in the end we're
 

9215
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:03,710
visual percepts but in the end we're
using the same thin film array

9216
03:12:03,710 --> 03:12:03,720
using the same thin film array
 

9217
03:12:03,720 --> 03:12:05,630
using the same thin film array
technology we're using the same robot

9218
03:12:05,630 --> 03:12:05,640
technology we're using the same robot
 

9219
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:07,750
technology we're using the same robot
insertion technology we're using the

9220
03:12:07,750 --> 03:12:07,760
insertion technology we're using the
 

9221
03:12:07,760 --> 03:12:10,070
insertion technology we're using the
same you know packaging technology now

9222
03:12:10,070 --> 03:12:10,080
same you know packaging technology now
 

9223
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:11,790
same you know packaging technology now
it's more the conversation focused

9224
03:12:11,790 --> 03:12:11,800
it's more the conversation focused
 

9225
03:12:11,800 --> 03:12:13,429
it's more the conversation focused
around what are the differences and what

9226
03:12:13,429 --> 03:12:13,439
around what are the differences and what
 

9227
03:12:13,439 --> 03:12:14,870
around what are the differences and what
are the implication of those differences

9228
03:12:14,870 --> 03:12:14,880
are the implication of those differences
 

9229
03:12:14,880 --> 03:12:18,349
are the implication of those differences
in safety and efficacy way that second

9230
03:12:18,349 --> 03:12:18,359
in safety and efficacy way that second
 

9231
03:12:18,359 --> 03:12:21,150
in safety and efficacy way that second
product is is both hilarious and awesome

9232
03:12:21,150 --> 03:12:21,160
product is is both hilarious and awesome
 

9233
03:12:21,160 --> 03:12:25,550
product is is both hilarious and awesome
to me uh that product

9234
03:12:25,550 --> 03:12:25,560

 

9235
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:29,630

being restoring sight for blind people

9236
03:12:29,630 --> 03:12:29,640
being restoring sight for blind people
 

9237
03:12:29,640 --> 03:12:33,389
being restoring sight for blind people
so can you speak to stimulating the

9238
03:12:33,389 --> 03:12:33,399
so can you speak to stimulating the
 

9239
03:12:33,399 --> 03:12:36,030
so can you speak to stimulating the
visual cortex I mean the the

9240
03:12:36,030 --> 03:12:36,040
visual cortex I mean the the
 

9241
03:12:36,040 --> 03:12:39,349
visual cortex I mean the the
possibilities there are just incredible

9242
03:12:39,349 --> 03:12:39,359
possibilities there are just incredible
 

9243
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:41,630
possibilities there are just incredible
to be able to give that gift back to

9244
03:12:41,630 --> 03:12:41,640
to be able to give that gift back to
 

9245
03:12:41,640 --> 03:12:45,190
to be able to give that gift back to
people who don't have sight or even any

9246
03:12:45,190 --> 03:12:45,200
people who don't have sight or even any
 

9247
03:12:45,200 --> 03:12:47,670
people who don't have sight or even any
aspect of that can you just speak to the

9248
03:12:47,670 --> 03:12:47,680
aspect of that can you just speak to the
 

9249
03:12:47,680 --> 03:12:50,429
aspect of that can you just speak to the
challenges of there's several challenges

9250
03:12:50,429 --> 03:12:50,439
challenges of there's several challenges
 

9251
03:12:50,439 --> 03:12:53,469
challenges of there's several challenges
here one of which is like you said from

9252
03:12:53,469 --> 03:12:53,479
here one of which is like you said from
 

9253
03:12:53,479 --> 03:12:54,830
here one of which is like you said from
recording to

9254
03:12:54,830 --> 03:12:54,840
recording to
 

9255
03:12:54,840 --> 03:12:57,429
recording to
stimulation just uh any aspect of that

9256
03:12:57,429 --> 03:12:57,439
stimulation just uh any aspect of that
 

9257
03:12:57,439 --> 03:13:00,349
stimulation just uh any aspect of that
that you're both excited and uh uh see

9258
03:13:00,349 --> 03:13:00,359
that you're both excited and uh uh see
 

9259
03:13:00,359 --> 03:13:01,790
that you're both excited and uh uh see
the challenges

9260
03:13:01,790 --> 03:13:01,800
the challenges
 

9261
03:13:01,800 --> 03:13:04,389
the challenges
of yeah I guess I'll start by saying

9262
03:13:04,389 --> 03:13:04,399
of yeah I guess I'll start by saying
 

9263
03:13:04,399 --> 03:13:06,510
of yeah I guess I'll start by saying
that we actually have been

9264
03:13:06,510 --> 03:13:06,520
that we actually have been
 

9265
03:13:06,520 --> 03:13:09,630
that we actually have been
um capable of stimulating through our

9266
03:13:09,630 --> 03:13:09,640
um capable of stimulating through our
 

9267
03:13:09,640 --> 03:13:12,309
um capable of stimulating through our
denl marray as well as our electronics

9268
03:13:12,309 --> 03:13:12,319
denl marray as well as our electronics
 

9269
03:13:12,319 --> 03:13:15,630
denl marray as well as our electronics
for years um you know we we have

9270
03:13:15,630 --> 03:13:15,640
for years um you know we we have
 

9271
03:13:15,640 --> 03:13:16,750
for years um you know we we have
actually demonstrated some of that

9272
03:13:16,750 --> 03:13:16,760
actually demonstrated some of that
 

9273
03:13:16,760 --> 03:13:18,630
actually demonstrated some of that
capability abilities for uh reanimating

9274
03:13:18,630 --> 03:13:18,640
capability abilities for uh reanimating
 

9275
03:13:18,640 --> 03:13:21,550
capability abilities for uh reanimating
the limb in the spinal cord um it it you

9276
03:13:21,550 --> 03:13:21,560
the limb in the spinal cord um it it you
 

9277
03:13:21,560 --> 03:13:24,150
the limb in the spinal cord um it it you
know obviously for for the current EFS

9278
03:13:24,150 --> 03:13:24,160
know obviously for for the current EFS
 

9279
03:13:24,160 --> 03:13:26,349
know obviously for for the current EFS
study you know we've Hardware disabled

9280
03:13:26,349 --> 03:13:26,359
study you know we've Hardware disabled
 

9281
03:13:26,359 --> 03:13:27,990
study you know we've Hardware disabled
that so that's that's something that you

9282
03:13:27,990 --> 03:13:28,000
that so that's that's something that you
 

9283
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:30,070
that so that's that's something that you
know we wanted to Embark as a separate

9284
03:13:30,070 --> 03:13:30,080
know we wanted to Embark as a separate
 

9285
03:13:30,080 --> 03:13:33,309
know we wanted to Embark as a separate
separate Journey um and and you know

9286
03:13:33,309 --> 03:13:33,319
separate Journey um and and you know
 

9287
03:13:33,319 --> 03:13:34,630
separate Journey um and and you know
obviously there are many many different

9288
03:13:34,630 --> 03:13:34,640
obviously there are many many different
 

9289
03:13:34,640 --> 03:13:37,670
obviously there are many many different
ways to write information into the brain

9290
03:13:37,670 --> 03:13:37,680
ways to write information into the brain
 

9291
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:38,910
ways to write information into the brain
the way in which we're doing that is

9292
03:13:38,910 --> 03:13:38,920
the way in which we're doing that is
 

9293
03:13:38,920 --> 03:13:40,630
the way in which we're doing that is
through electrical you know passing

9294
03:13:40,630 --> 03:13:40,640
through electrical you know passing
 

9295
03:13:40,640 --> 03:13:43,349
through electrical you know passing
electrical current and and kind of

9296
03:13:43,349 --> 03:13:43,359
electrical current and and kind of
 

9297
03:13:43,359 --> 03:13:46,190
electrical current and and kind of
causing that to really change the local

9298
03:13:46,190 --> 03:13:46,200
causing that to really change the local
 

9299
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:47,990
causing that to really change the local
environment so that you

9300
03:13:47,990 --> 03:13:48,000
environment so that you
 

9301
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:49,910
environment so that you
can sort of

9302
03:13:49,910 --> 03:13:49,920
can sort of
 

9303
03:13:49,920 --> 03:13:52,030
can sort of
artificially cause kind of the the

9304
03:13:52,030 --> 03:13:52,040
artificially cause kind of the the
 

9305
03:13:52,040 --> 03:13:54,910
artificially cause kind of the the
neurons to depolarize in in in nearby

9306
03:13:54,910 --> 03:13:54,920
neurons to depolarize in in in nearby
 

9307
03:13:54,920 --> 03:13:59,550
neurons to depolarize in in in nearby
areas for for vision specifically um you

9308
03:13:59,550 --> 03:13:59,560
areas for for vision specifically um you
 

9309
03:13:59,560 --> 03:14:02,389
areas for for vision specifically um you
know the way our visual system works it

9310
03:14:02,389 --> 03:14:02,399
know the way our visual system works it
 

9311
03:14:02,399 --> 03:14:04,190
know the way our visual system works it
it's both well understood I mean

9312
03:14:04,190 --> 03:14:04,200
it's both well understood I mean
 

9313
03:14:04,200 --> 03:14:06,110
it's both well understood I mean
anything with kind of brain there

9314
03:14:06,110 --> 03:14:06,120
anything with kind of brain there
 

9315
03:14:06,120 --> 03:14:07,670
anything with kind of brain there
aspects of it that's well understood but

9316
03:14:07,670 --> 03:14:07,680
aspects of it that's well understood but
 

9317
03:14:07,680 --> 03:14:08,830
aspects of it that's well understood but
in the end like we don't really know

9318
03:14:08,830 --> 03:14:08,840
in the end like we don't really know
 

9319
03:14:08,840 --> 03:14:11,229
in the end like we don't really know
anything um but the way visual system

9320
03:14:11,229 --> 03:14:11,239
anything um but the way visual system
 

9321
03:14:11,239 --> 03:14:13,349
anything um but the way visual system
works is that you have Photon hitting

9322
03:14:13,349 --> 03:14:13,359
works is that you have Photon hitting
 

9323
03:14:13,359 --> 03:14:17,790
works is that you have Photon hitting
your eye and in your eyes uh you know

9324
03:14:17,790 --> 03:14:17,800
your eye and in your eyes uh you know
 

9325
03:14:17,800 --> 03:14:19,750
your eye and in your eyes uh you know
there are these um specialized cells

9326
03:14:19,750 --> 03:14:19,760
there are these um specialized cells
 

9327
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:22,590
there are these um specialized cells
called photo receptor cells that convert

9328
03:14:22,590 --> 03:14:22,600
called photo receptor cells that convert
 

9329
03:14:22,600 --> 03:14:25,070
called photo receptor cells that convert
the photon energy into electrical

9330
03:14:25,070 --> 03:14:25,080
the photon energy into electrical
 

9331
03:14:25,080 --> 03:14:27,710
the photon energy into electrical
signals and then they get that then gets

9332
03:14:27,710 --> 03:14:27,720
signals and then they get that then gets
 

9333
03:14:27,720 --> 03:14:30,710
signals and then they get that then gets
projected to um your back of your head

9334
03:14:30,710 --> 03:14:30,720
projected to um your back of your head
 

9335
03:14:30,720 --> 03:14:33,349
projected to um your back of your head
your visual cortex um you know goes

9336
03:14:33,349 --> 03:14:33,359
your visual cortex um you know goes
 

9337
03:14:33,359 --> 03:14:35,990
your visual cortex um you know goes
through actually um you know theic

9338
03:14:35,990 --> 03:14:36,000
through actually um you know theic
 

9339
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,110
through actually um you know theic
system called lgn that then projects it

9340
03:14:38,110 --> 03:14:38,120
system called lgn that then projects it
 

9341
03:14:38,120 --> 03:14:40,070
system called lgn that then projects it
out and then in the visual cortex

9342
03:14:40,070 --> 03:14:40,080
out and then in the visual cortex
 

9343
03:14:40,080 --> 03:14:44,150
out and then in the visual cortex
there's you know visual area one or V1

9344
03:14:44,150 --> 03:14:44,160
there's you know visual area one or V1
 

9345
03:14:44,160 --> 03:14:45,950
there's you know visual area one or V1
and then there's bunch of other higher

9346
03:14:45,950 --> 03:14:45,960
and then there's bunch of other higher
 

9347
03:14:45,960 --> 03:14:48,510
and then there's bunch of other higher
level processing layers like like V2 V3

9348
03:14:48,510 --> 03:14:48,520
level processing layers like like V2 V3
 

9349
03:14:48,520 --> 03:14:50,030
level processing layers like like V2 V3
and there there are actually kind of

9350
03:14:50,030 --> 03:14:50,040
and there there are actually kind of
 

9351
03:14:50,040 --> 03:14:53,349
and there there are actually kind of
interesting parallels and when you study

9352
03:14:53,349 --> 03:14:53,359
interesting parallels and when you study
 

9353
03:14:53,359 --> 03:14:55,429
interesting parallels and when you study
the behaviors of these convolutional

9354
03:14:55,429 --> 03:14:55,439
the behaviors of these convolutional
 

9355
03:14:55,439 --> 03:14:57,870
the behaviors of these convolutional
neural networks like what the different

9356
03:14:57,870 --> 03:14:57,880
neural networks like what the different
 

9357
03:14:57,880 --> 03:15:00,670
neural networks like what the different
layers of the network is detecting you

9358
03:15:00,670 --> 03:15:00,680
layers of the network is detecting you
 

9359
03:15:00,680 --> 03:15:02,229
layers of the network is detecting you
know first they're detecting like these

9360
03:15:02,229 --> 03:15:02,239
know first they're detecting like these
 

9361
03:15:02,239 --> 03:15:04,790
know first they're detecting like these
edges and they're then detecting some

9362
03:15:04,790 --> 03:15:04,800
edges and they're then detecting some
 

9363
03:15:04,800 --> 03:15:06,670
edges and they're then detecting some
more natural curves and then they start

9364
03:15:06,670 --> 03:15:06,680
more natural curves and then they start
 

9365
03:15:06,680 --> 03:15:08,630
more natural curves and then they start
to detect like objects right kind of

9366
03:15:08,630 --> 03:15:08,640
to detect like objects right kind of
 

9367
03:15:08,640 --> 03:15:10,630
to detect like objects right kind of
similar thing happens in the brain um

9368
03:15:10,630 --> 03:15:10,640
similar thing happens in the brain um
 

9369
03:15:10,640 --> 03:15:12,429
similar thing happens in the brain um
and a lot of that has been inspired and

9370
03:15:12,429 --> 03:15:12,439
and a lot of that has been inspired and
 

9371
03:15:12,439 --> 03:15:14,030
and a lot of that has been inspired and
also you it's been kind of exciting to

9372
03:15:14,030 --> 03:15:14,040
also you it's been kind of exciting to
 

9373
03:15:14,040 --> 03:15:16,670
also you it's been kind of exciting to
see some of the correlations there um

9374
03:15:16,670 --> 03:15:16,680
see some of the correlations there um
 

9375
03:15:16,680 --> 03:15:19,030
see some of the correlations there um
but you know things like from there

9376
03:15:19,030 --> 03:15:19,040
but you know things like from there
 

9377
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:21,990
but you know things like from there
where does cognition R arise and where

9378
03:15:21,990 --> 03:15:22,000
where does cognition R arise and where
 

9379
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:24,030
where does cognition R arise and where
where's color encoded there's there's

9380
03:15:24,030 --> 03:15:24,040
where's color encoded there's there's
 

9381
03:15:24,040 --> 03:15:26,550
where's color encoded there's there's
just not a lot of um understanding

9382
03:15:26,550 --> 03:15:26,560
just not a lot of um understanding
 

9383
03:15:26,560 --> 03:15:28,950
just not a lot of um understanding
fundamental understanding there so in

9384
03:15:28,950 --> 03:15:28,960
fundamental understanding there so in
 

9385
03:15:28,960 --> 03:15:32,469
fundamental understanding there so in
terms of kind of bringing sight back to

9386
03:15:32,469 --> 03:15:32,479
terms of kind of bringing sight back to
 

9387
03:15:32,479 --> 03:15:35,030
terms of kind of bringing sight back to
those that are blind um there are many

9388
03:15:35,030 --> 03:15:35,040
those that are blind um there are many
 

9389
03:15:35,040 --> 03:15:37,030
those that are blind um there are many
different forms of blindness uh there's

9390
03:15:37,030 --> 03:15:37,040
different forms of blindness uh there's
 

9391
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:39,030
different forms of blindness uh there's
actually million people one million

9392
03:15:39,030 --> 03:15:39,040
actually million people one million
 

9393
03:15:39,040 --> 03:15:40,990
actually million people one million
people in the US that are legally blind

9394
03:15:40,990 --> 03:15:41,000
people in the US that are legally blind
 

9395
03:15:41,000 --> 03:15:43,710
people in the US that are legally blind
um you know that means like certain uh

9396
03:15:43,710 --> 03:15:43,720
um you know that means like certain uh
 

9397
03:15:43,720 --> 03:15:45,790
um you know that means like certain uh
like score below in kind of the the

9398
03:15:45,790 --> 03:15:45,800
like score below in kind of the the
 

9399
03:15:45,800 --> 03:15:47,590
like score below in kind of the the
visual test um I think it's something

9400
03:15:47,590 --> 03:15:47,600
visual test um I think it's something
 

9401
03:15:47,600 --> 03:15:50,630
visual test um I think it's something
like if you can see something uh at 20

9402
03:15:50,630 --> 03:15:50,640
like if you can see something uh at 20
 

9403
03:15:50,640 --> 03:15:53,670
like if you can see something uh at 20
ft distance that normal people can see

9404
03:15:53,670 --> 03:15:53,680
ft distance that normal people can see
 

9405
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:55,990
ft distance that normal people can see
at 200 ft distance like you're like if

9406
03:15:55,990 --> 03:15:56,000
at 200 ft distance like you're like if
 

9407
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:57,150
at 200 ft distance like you're like if
you're worse than that you're legally

9408
03:15:57,150 --> 03:15:57,160
you're worse than that you're legally
 

9409
03:15:57,160 --> 03:15:59,590
you're worse than that you're legally
blind so fundament that means you can't

9410
03:15:59,590 --> 03:15:59,600
blind so fundament that means you can't
 

9411
03:15:59,600 --> 03:16:01,790
blind so fundament that means you can't
function effectively corre using sight

9412
03:16:01,790 --> 03:16:01,800
function effectively corre using sight
 

9413
03:16:01,800 --> 03:16:04,309
function effectively corre using sight
in the world yeah like to navigate your

03:16:04,309 --> 03:16:04,319
in the world yeah like to navigate your
 

9415
03:16:04,319 --> 03:16:07,429

environment um and yeah there are

9416
03:16:07,429 --> 03:16:07,439
environment um and yeah there are
 

9417
03:16:07,439 --> 03:16:09,229
environment um and yeah there are
different forms of blindness there are

9418
03:16:09,229 --> 03:16:09,239
different forms of blindness there are
 

9419
03:16:09,239 --> 03:16:12,189
different forms of blindness there are
forms of blindness where uh there's some

9420
03:16:12,189 --> 03:16:12,199
forms of blindness where uh there's some
 

9421
03:16:12,199 --> 03:16:16,030
forms of blindness where uh there's some
degeneration of your uh retina um these

9422
03:16:16,030 --> 03:16:16,040
degeneration of your uh retina um these
 

9423
03:16:16,040 --> 03:16:17,590

electrodes into the visual cortex you

9434
03:16:31,950 --> 03:16:31,960
electrodes into the visual cortex you
 

9435
03:16:31,960 --> 03:16:36,030
electrodes into the visual cortex you
can actually um uh build retinal

9436
03:16:36,030 --> 03:16:36,040
can actually um uh build retinal
 

9437
03:16:36,040 --> 03:16:37,990
can actually um uh build retinal
prosthetic devices that actually just

9438
03:16:37,990 --> 03:16:38,000
prosthetic devices that actually just
 

9439
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:39,710
prosthetic devices that actually just
replaces a function of that retinal

9440
03:16:39,710 --> 03:16:39,720
replaces a function of that retinal
 

9441

many companies that are working on that
 

9445
03:16:43,120 --> 03:16:46,229
many companies that are working on that
but that that's a very small slice Alia

03:18:01,429 --> 03:18:01,439
um kind of white yellowish dots that you
 

9507
03:18:01,439 --> 03:18:02,950
um kind of white yellowish dots that you
can also create by just pressing your

9508
03:18:02,950 --> 03:18:02,960
can also create by just pressing your
 

9509
03:18:02,960 --> 03:18:05,469
can also create by just pressing your
eyes um you can actually create those

9510
03:18:05,469 --> 03:18:05,479
eyes um you can actually create those
 

9511
03:18:05,479 --> 03:18:07,389
eyes um you can actually create those
percepts by stimulating the visual

9512
03:18:07,389 --> 03:18:07,399
percepts by stimulating the visual
 

9513
03:18:07,399 --> 03:18:09,870
percepts by stimulating the visual
cortex and the name of the game is

9514
03:18:09,870 --> 03:18:09,880
cortex and the name of the game is
 

9515
03:18:09,880 --> 03:18:12,429
cortex and the name of the game is
really have many of those and have those

9516
03:18:12,429 --> 03:18:12,439
really have many of those and have those
 

9517
03:18:12,439 --> 03:18:14,469
really have many of those and have those
percepts be the phosphines be as small

9518
03:18:14,469 --> 03:18:14,479
percepts be the phosphines be as small
 

9519
03:18:14,479 --> 03:18:16,110
percepts be the phosphines be as small
as possible so that you can start to

9520
03:18:16,110 --> 03:18:16,120
as possible so that you can start to
 

9521
03:18:16,120 --> 03:18:18,030
as possible so that you can start to
tell apart like the individual pixels of

9522
03:18:18,030 --> 03:18:18,040
tell apart like the individual pixels of
 

9523
03:18:18,040 --> 03:18:20,590
tell apart like the individual pixels of
the the of the screen right so if you

9524
03:18:20,590 --> 03:18:20,600
the the of the screen right so if you
 

9525
03:18:20,600 --> 03:18:22,510
the the of the screen right so if you
have many many of those you know

9526
03:18:22,510 --> 03:18:22,520
have many many of those you know
 

9527
03:18:22,520 --> 03:18:25,870
have many many of those you know
potentially you'll be able to um you

9528
03:18:25,870 --> 03:18:25,880
potentially you'll be able to um you
 

9529
03:18:25,880 --> 03:18:27,870
potentially you'll be able to um you
know in in the long term be able to

9530
03:18:27,870 --> 03:18:27,880
know in in the long term be able to
 

9531
03:18:27,880 --> 03:18:29,750
know in in the long term be able to
actually get naturalistic Vision but in

9532
03:18:29,750 --> 03:18:29,760
actually get naturalistic Vision but in
 

9533
03:18:29,760 --> 03:18:32,510
actually get naturalistic Vision but in
the mid like short term to maybe midterm

9534
03:18:32,510 --> 03:18:32,520
the mid like short term to maybe midterm
 

9535
03:18:32,520 --> 03:18:34,510
the mid like short term to maybe midterm
um being able to at least be able to

9536
03:18:34,510 --> 03:18:34,520
um being able to at least be able to
 

9537
03:18:34,520 --> 03:18:37,030
um being able to at least be able to
have object detection algorithms run on

9538
03:18:37,030 --> 03:18:37,040
have object detection algorithms run on
 

9539
03:18:37,040 --> 03:18:40,429
have object detection algorithms run on
your um on your glasses uh the pre

9540
03:18:40,429 --> 03:18:40,439
your um on your glasses uh the pre
 

9541
03:18:40,439 --> 03:18:42,349
your um on your glasses uh the pre
processing units and then being able to

9542
03:18:42,349 --> 03:18:42,359
processing units and then being able to
 

9543
03:18:42,359 --> 03:18:44,030
processing units and then being able to
at least see the edges of things so you

9544
03:18:44,030 --> 03:18:44,040
at least see the edges of things so you
 

9545
03:18:44,040 --> 03:18:46,750
at least see the edges of things so you
don't bump into stuff it's incred

9546
03:18:46,750 --> 03:18:46,760
don't bump into stuff it's incred
 

9547
03:18:46,760 --> 03:18:48,630
don't bump into stuff it's incred
inredible this is really incredible so

9548
03:18:48,630 --> 03:18:48,640
inredible this is really incredible so
 

9549
03:18:48,640 --> 03:18:50,630
inredible this is really incredible so
you basically would be adding pixels and

9550
03:18:50,630 --> 03:18:50,640
you basically would be adding pixels and
 

9551
03:18:50,640 --> 03:18:52,189
you basically would be adding pixels and
your brain would start to figure out

9552
03:18:52,189 --> 03:18:52,199
your brain would start to figure out
 

9553
03:18:52,199 --> 03:18:55,510
your brain would start to figure out
what those pixels mean yeah and like

9554
03:18:55,510 --> 03:18:55,520
what those pixels mean yeah and like
 

9555
03:18:55,520 --> 03:18:57,349
what those pixels mean yeah and like
with with different kinds of assistant

9556
03:18:57,349 --> 03:18:57,359
with with different kinds of assistant
 

9557
03:18:57,359 --> 03:18:59,590
with with different kinds of assistant
on the signal processing on all fronts

9558
03:18:59,590 --> 03:18:59,600
on the signal processing on all fronts
 

9559
03:18:59,600 --> 03:19:01,710
on the signal processing on all fronts
yeah the the thing that actually so a

9560
03:19:01,710 --> 03:19:01,720
yeah the the thing that actually so a
 

9561
03:19:01,720 --> 03:19:03,269
yeah the the thing that actually so a
couple things one is um you know

9562
03:19:03,269 --> 03:19:03,279
couple things one is um you know
 

9563
03:19:03,279 --> 03:19:07,150
couple things one is um you know
obviously if you're uh blind from birth

9564
03:19:07,150 --> 03:19:07,160
obviously if you're uh blind from birth
 

9565
03:19:07,160 --> 03:19:09,590
obviously if you're uh blind from birth
um the way brain works especially in the

9566
03:19:09,590 --> 03:19:09,600
um the way brain works especially in the
 

9567
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:11,510
um the way brain works especially in the
early age

9568
03:19:11,510 --> 03:19:11,520
early age
 

9569
03:19:11,520 --> 03:19:14,309
early age
um neuroplasticity is really nothing

9570
03:19:14,309 --> 03:19:14,319
um neuroplasticity is really nothing
 

9571
03:19:14,319 --> 03:19:17,110
um neuroplasticity is really nothing
other than you know kind of your brain

9572
03:19:17,110 --> 03:19:17,120
other than you know kind of your brain
 

9573
03:19:17,120 --> 03:19:18,670
other than you know kind of your brain
and different parts of your brain

9574
03:19:18,670 --> 03:19:18,680
and different parts of your brain
 

9575
03:19:18,680 --> 03:19:21,710
and different parts of your brain
fighting for The Limited territory yeah

9576
03:19:21,710 --> 03:19:21,720
fighting for The Limited territory yeah
 

9577
03:19:21,720 --> 03:19:24,110
fighting for The Limited territory yeah
um and and I mean very very quickly you

9578
03:19:24,110 --> 03:19:24,120
um and and I mean very very quickly you
 

9579
03:19:24,120 --> 03:19:26,229
um and and I mean very very quickly you
see you see cases where you know people

9580
03:19:26,229 --> 03:19:26,239
see you see cases where you know people
 

9581
03:19:26,239 --> 03:19:28,269
see you see cases where you know people
that are I mean you also hear about

9582
03:19:28,269 --> 03:19:28,279
that are I mean you also hear about
 

9583
03:19:28,279 --> 03:19:29,870
that are I mean you also hear about
people who are blind that have

9584
03:19:29,870 --> 03:19:29,880
people who are blind that have
 

9585
03:19:29,880 --> 03:19:32,429
people who are blind that have
heightened sense of hearing or some

9586
03:19:32,429 --> 03:19:32,439
heightened sense of hearing or some
 

9587
03:19:32,439 --> 03:19:34,510
heightened sense of hearing or some
other senses and the reason for that is

9588
03:19:34,510 --> 03:19:34,520
other senses and the reason for that is
 

9589
03:19:34,520 --> 03:19:37,070
other senses and the reason for that is
because that cortex that's not used just

9590
03:19:37,070 --> 03:19:37,080
because that cortex that's not used just
 

9591
03:19:37,080 --> 03:19:38,910
because that cortex that's not used just
gets taken over by these different parts

9592
03:19:38,910 --> 03:19:38,920
gets taken over by these different parts
 

9593
03:19:38,920 --> 03:19:41,110
gets taken over by these different parts
of the cortex so for those types of

9594
03:19:41,110 --> 03:19:41,120
of the cortex so for those types of
 

9595
03:19:41,120 --> 03:19:44,469
of the cortex so for those types of
individuals um I mean I guess they're

9596
03:19:44,469 --> 03:19:44,479
individuals um I mean I guess they're
 

9597
03:19:44,479 --> 03:19:46,910
individuals um I mean I guess they're
going to have to Now map some other

9598
03:19:46,910 --> 03:19:46,920
going to have to Now map some other
 

9599
03:19:46,920 --> 03:19:49,070
going to have to Now map some other
parts of their senses into what they

9600
03:19:49,070 --> 03:19:49,080
parts of their senses into what they
 

9601
03:19:49,080 --> 03:19:51,150
parts of their senses into what they
call Vision but it's going to be

9602
03:19:51,150 --> 03:19:51,160
call Vision but it's going to be
 

9603
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:52,189
call Vision but it's going to be
obviously a very very different

9604
03:19:52,189 --> 03:19:52,199
obviously a very very different
 

9605
03:19:52,199 --> 03:19:55,510
obviously a very very different
conscious experience um

9606
03:19:55,510 --> 03:19:55,520
conscious experience um
 

9607
03:19:55,520 --> 03:19:57,830
conscious experience um
before so so I think that's a

9608
03:19:57,830 --> 03:19:57,840
before so so I think that's a
 

9609
03:19:57,840 --> 03:19:59,790
before so so I think that's a
interesting caveat the other thing that

9610
03:19:59,790 --> 03:19:59,800
interesting caveat the other thing that
 

9611
03:19:59,800 --> 03:20:01,910
interesting caveat the other thing that
also is important to highlight is that

9612
03:20:01,910 --> 03:20:01,920
also is important to highlight is that
 

9613
03:20:01,920 --> 03:20:05,550
also is important to highlight is that
we're currently limited by our biology

9614
03:20:05,550 --> 03:20:05,560
we're currently limited by our biology
 

9615
03:20:05,560 --> 03:20:07,630
we're currently limited by our biology
in terms of the the wavelength that we

9616
03:20:07,630 --> 03:20:07,640
in terms of the the wavelength that we
 

9617
03:20:07,640 --> 03:20:10,469
in terms of the the wavelength that we
can see there's a very very small

9618
03:20:10,469 --> 03:20:10,479
can see there's a very very small
 

9619
03:20:10,479 --> 03:20:13,229
can see there's a very very small
wavelength that is a visible um light

9620
03:20:13,229 --> 03:20:13,239
wavelength that is a visible um light
 

9621
03:20:13,239 --> 03:20:15,030
wavelength that is a visible um light
wavelength that we can see with our eyes

9622
03:20:15,030 --> 03:20:15,040
wavelength that we can see with our eyes
 

9623
03:20:15,040 --> 03:20:16,510
wavelength that we can see with our eyes
but when you have an external camera

9624
03:20:16,510 --> 03:20:16,520
but when you have an external camera
 

9625
03:20:16,520 --> 03:20:18,870
but when you have an external camera
with this um BCI system you're not

9626
03:20:18,870 --> 03:20:18,880
with this um BCI system you're not
 

9627
03:20:18,880 --> 03:20:20,670
with this um BCI system you're not
limited to that you can have infrared

9628
03:20:20,670 --> 03:20:20,680
limited to that you can have infrared
 

9629
03:20:20,680 --> 03:20:22,349
limited to that you can have infrared
you can have UV you can have whatever

9630
03:20:22,349 --> 03:20:22,359
you can have UV you can have whatever
 

9631
03:20:22,359 --> 03:20:24,950
you can have UV you can have whatever
other spectrum that you want to see and

9632
03:20:24,950 --> 03:20:24,960
other spectrum that you want to see and
 

9633
03:20:24,960 --> 03:20:26,349
other spectrum that you want to see and
whether that gets math to some sort of

9634
03:20:26,349 --> 03:20:26,359
whether that gets math to some sort of
 

9635
03:20:26,359 --> 03:20:28,389
whether that gets math to some sort of
weird conscious experience I have no

9636
03:20:28,389 --> 03:20:28,399
weird conscious experience I have no
 

9637
03:20:28,399 --> 03:20:31,510
weird conscious experience I have no
idea but when I you know often time I

9638
03:20:31,510 --> 03:20:31,520
idea but when I you know often time I
 

9639
03:20:31,520 --> 03:20:33,510
idea but when I you know often time I
talk to people about the goal of

9640
03:20:33,510 --> 03:20:33,520
talk to people about the goal of
 

9641
03:20:33,520 --> 03:20:35,229
talk to people about the goal of
neuralink being going beyond the limits

9642
03:20:35,229 --> 03:20:35,239
neuralink being going beyond the limits
 

9643
03:20:35,239 --> 03:20:38,429
neuralink being going beyond the limits
of our biology um that's sort of what I

9644
03:20:38,429 --> 03:20:38,439
of our biology um that's sort of what I
 

9645
03:20:38,439 --> 03:20:41,309
of our biology um that's sort of what I
mean and if you're able to control the

9646
03:20:41,309 --> 03:20:41,319
mean and if you're able to control the
 

9647
03:20:41,319 --> 03:20:44,349
mean and if you're able to control the
kind of raw signal is that when we use

9648
03:20:44,349 --> 03:20:44,359
kind of raw signal is that when we use
 

9649
03:20:44,359 --> 03:20:47,150
kind of raw signal is that when we use
our site we're getting the

9650
03:20:47,150 --> 03:20:47,160
our site we're getting the
 

9651
03:20:47,160 --> 03:20:49,389
our site we're getting the
photons and there's not much processing

9652
03:20:49,389 --> 03:20:49,399
photons and there's not much processing
 

9653
03:20:49,399 --> 03:20:52,510
photons and there's not much processing
on it if you're be able to control that

9654
03:20:52,510 --> 03:20:52,520
on it if you're be able to control that
 

9655
03:20:52,520 --> 03:20:53,870
on it if you're be able to control that
signal maybe you can do some kind of

9656
03:20:53,870 --> 03:20:53,880
signal maybe you can do some kind of
 

9657
03:20:53,880 --> 03:20:55,710
signal maybe you can do some kind of
processing maybe you do object detection

9658
03:20:55,710 --> 03:20:55,720
processing maybe you do object detection
 

9659
03:20:55,720 --> 03:20:58,309
processing maybe you do object detection
ahead of time yeah you're doing some

9660
03:20:58,309 --> 03:20:58,319
ahead of time yeah you're doing some
 

9661
03:20:58,319 --> 03:21:00,070
ahead of time yeah you're doing some
kind of pre-processing and there's a lot

9662
03:21:00,070 --> 03:21:00,080
kind of pre-processing and there's a lot
 

9663
03:21:00,080 --> 03:21:02,510
kind of pre-processing and there's a lot
of possibilities to explore that so it's

9664
03:21:02,510 --> 03:21:02,520
of possibilities to explore that so it's
 

9665
03:21:02,520 --> 03:21:06,070
of possibilities to explore that so it's
not just in increasing sort of thermal

9666
03:21:06,070 --> 03:21:06,080
not just in increasing sort of thermal
 

9667
03:21:06,080 --> 03:21:08,070
not just in increasing sort of thermal
imaging that kind of stuff but it's also

9668
03:21:08,070 --> 03:21:08,080
imaging that kind of stuff but it's also
 

9669
03:21:08,080 --> 03:21:09,950
imaging that kind of stuff but it's also
just doing some kind of interesting

9670
03:21:09,950 --> 03:21:09,960
just doing some kind of interesting
 

9671
03:21:09,960 --> 03:21:13,269
just doing some kind of interesting
processing yeah I I mean my my theory of

9672
03:21:13,269 --> 03:21:13,279
processing yeah I I mean my my theory of
 

9673
03:21:13,279 --> 03:21:15,750
processing yeah I I mean my my theory of
how like visual system works also is

9674
03:21:15,750 --> 03:21:15,760
how like visual system works also is
 

9675
03:21:15,760 --> 03:21:17,309
how like visual system works also is
that

9676
03:21:17,309 --> 03:21:17,319
that
 

9677
03:21:17,319 --> 03:21:19,910
that
um I mean there's just so many things

9678
03:21:19,910 --> 03:21:19,920
um I mean there's just so many things
 

9679
03:21:19,920 --> 03:21:21,870
um I mean there's just so many things
happening in the world and there's a lot

9680
03:21:21,870 --> 03:21:21,880
happening in the world and there's a lot
 

9681
03:21:21,880 --> 03:21:23,950
happening in the world and there's a lot
of photons that are going into your eye

9682
03:21:23,950 --> 03:21:23,960
of photons that are going into your eye
 

9683
03:21:23,960 --> 03:21:26,630
of photons that are going into your eye
and it it's unclear exactly where some

9684
03:21:26,630 --> 03:21:26,640
and it it's unclear exactly where some
 

9685
03:21:26,640 --> 03:21:28,750
and it it's unclear exactly where some
of the pre-processing steps are

9686
03:21:28,750 --> 03:21:28,760
of the pre-processing steps are
 

9687
03:21:28,760 --> 03:21:30,790
of the pre-processing steps are
happening but I I mean I actually think

9688
03:21:30,790 --> 03:21:30,800
happening but I I mean I actually think
 

9689
03:21:30,800 --> 03:21:34,269
happening but I I mean I actually think
that just just from a fundamental

9690
03:21:34,269 --> 03:21:34,279
that just just from a fundamental
 

9691
03:21:34,279 --> 03:21:37,630
that just just from a fundamental
perspective there's just so much uh the

9692
03:21:37,630 --> 03:21:37,640
perspective there's just so much uh the
 

9693
03:21:37,640 --> 03:21:40,189
perspective there's just so much uh the
reality that we're in if it's a reality

9694
03:21:40,189 --> 03:21:40,199
reality that we're in if it's a reality
 

9695
03:21:40,199 --> 03:21:44,309
reality that we're in if it's a reality
um is so there's so much data and I

9696
03:21:44,309 --> 03:21:44,319
um is so there's so much data and I
 

9697
03:21:44,319 --> 03:21:47,269
um is so there's so much data and I
think humans are just unable to actually

9698
03:21:47,269 --> 03:21:47,279
think humans are just unable to actually
 

9699
03:21:47,279 --> 03:21:49,349
think humans are just unable to actually
like eat enough actually to process all

9700
03:21:49,349 --> 03:21:49,359
like eat enough actually to process all
 

9701
03:21:49,359 --> 03:21:50,590
like eat enough actually to process all
that information so there's some sort of

9702
03:21:50,590 --> 03:21:50,600
that information so there's some sort of
 

9703
03:21:50,600 --> 03:21:52,469
that information so there's some sort of
filtering that does happen whether that

9704
03:21:52,469 --> 03:21:52,479
filtering that does happen whether that
 

9705
03:21:52,479 --> 03:21:53,710
filtering that does happen whether that
happens in the retina whether that

9706
03:21:53,710 --> 03:21:53,720
happens in the retina whether that
 

9707
03:21:53,720 --> 03:21:55,309
happens in the retina whether that
happens in different layers of the

9708
03:21:55,309 --> 03:21:55,319
happens in different layers of the
 

9709
03:21:55,319 --> 03:21:59,269
happens in different layers of the
visual cortex unclear but like the

9710
03:21:59,269 --> 03:21:59,279
visual cortex unclear but like the
 

9711
03:21:59,279 --> 03:22:02,070
visual cortex unclear but like the
analogy that I sometimes think about is

9712
03:22:02,070 --> 03:22:02,080
analogy that I sometimes think about is
 

9713
03:22:02,080 --> 03:22:04,550
analogy that I sometimes think about is
you know if uh if your brain is a CCD

9714
03:22:04,550 --> 03:22:04,560
you know if uh if your brain is a CCD
 

9715
03:22:04,560 --> 03:22:07,590
you know if uh if your brain is a CCD
camera and the in all of the information

9716
03:22:07,590 --> 03:22:07,600
camera and the in all of the information
 

9717
03:22:07,600 --> 03:22:10,550
camera and the in all of the information
in the world is a sun um and when you

9718
03:22:10,550 --> 03:22:10,560
in the world is a sun um and when you
 

9719
03:22:10,560 --> 03:22:11,990
in the world is a sun um and when you
try to actually look at the sun with the

9720
03:22:11,990 --> 03:22:12,000
try to actually look at the sun with the
 

9721
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:13,630
try to actually look at the sun with the
CCD camera it's just going to saturate

9722
03:22:13,630 --> 03:22:13,640
CCD camera it's just going to saturate
 

9723
03:22:13,640 --> 03:22:15,550
CCD camera it's just going to saturate
the sensors right cuz it's a enormous

9724
03:22:15,550 --> 03:22:15,560
the sensors right cuz it's a enormous
 

9725
03:22:15,560 --> 03:22:17,349
the sensors right cuz it's a enormous
amount of energy so you what you do is

9726
03:22:17,349 --> 03:22:17,359
amount of energy so you what you do is
 

9727
03:22:17,359 --> 03:22:20,189
amount of energy so you what you do is
you end up adding these uh filters right

9728
03:22:20,189 --> 03:22:20,199
you end up adding these uh filters right
 

9729
03:22:20,199 --> 03:22:22,510
you end up adding these uh filters right
to just kind of narrow the information

9730
03:22:22,510 --> 03:22:22,520
to just kind of narrow the information
 

9731
03:22:22,520 --> 03:22:25,349
to just kind of narrow the information
that's coming to you and being captured

9732
03:22:25,349 --> 03:22:25,359
that's coming to you and being captured
 

9733
03:22:25,359 --> 03:22:26,830
that's coming to you and being captured
and I

9734
03:22:26,830 --> 03:22:26,840
and I
 

9735
03:22:26,840 --> 03:22:30,189
and I
think you know things like our

9736
03:22:30,189 --> 03:22:30,199
think you know things like our
 

9737
03:22:30,199 --> 03:22:33,750
think you know things like our
experiences or our

9738
03:22:33,750 --> 03:22:33,760
experiences or our
 

9739
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:37,630
experiences or our
um uh you know like drugs like profal

9740
03:22:37,630 --> 03:22:37,640
um uh you know like drugs like profal
 

9741
03:22:37,640 --> 03:22:39,510
um uh you know like drugs like profal
that like anesthetic drug or you know

9742
03:22:39,510 --> 03:22:39,520
that like anesthetic drug or you know
 

9743
03:22:39,520 --> 03:22:41,030
that like anesthetic drug or you know
psychedelics what they're doing is

9744
03:22:41,030 --> 03:22:41,040
psychedelics what they're doing is
 

9745
03:22:41,040 --> 03:22:43,269
psychedelics what they're doing is
they're kind of swapping out these

9746
03:22:43,269 --> 03:22:43,279
they're kind of swapping out these
 

9747
03:22:43,279 --> 03:22:45,110
they're kind of swapping out these
filters and putting in new ones or

9748
03:22:45,110 --> 03:22:45,120
filters and putting in new ones or
 

9749
03:22:45,120 --> 03:22:47,349
filters and putting in new ones or
removing older ones and

9750
03:22:47,349 --> 03:22:47,359
removing older ones and
 

9751
03:22:47,359 --> 03:22:49,030
removing older ones and
kind of controlling our conscious

9752
03:22:49,030 --> 03:22:49,040
kind of controlling our conscious
 

9753
03:22:49,040 --> 03:22:51,150
kind of controlling our conscious
experience yeah man not to distract from

9754
03:22:51,150 --> 03:22:51,160
experience yeah man not to distract from
 

9755
03:22:51,160 --> 03:22:52,750
experience yeah man not to distract from
the topic but I just took a very high

9756
03:22:52,750 --> 03:22:52,760
the topic but I just took a very high
 

9757
03:22:52,760 --> 03:22:55,910
the topic but I just took a very high
dose of iasa in the Amazon jungle so yes

9758
03:22:55,910 --> 03:22:55,920
dose of iasa in the Amazon jungle so yes
 

9759
03:22:55,920 --> 03:22:57,950
dose of iasa in the Amazon jungle so yes
it's a nice way to think about it you're

9760
03:22:57,950 --> 03:22:57,960
it's a nice way to think about it you're
 

9761
03:22:57,960 --> 03:23:00,070
it's a nice way to think about it you're
swapping out different different

9762
03:23:00,070 --> 03:23:00,080
swapping out different different
 

9763
03:23:00,080 --> 03:23:02,469
swapping out different different
experiences and with neur link being

9764
03:23:02,469 --> 03:23:02,479
experiences and with neur link being
 

9765
03:23:02,479 --> 03:23:05,309
experiences and with neur link being
able to control that primarily at first

9766
03:23:05,309 --> 03:23:05,319
able to control that primarily at first
 

9767
03:23:05,319 --> 03:23:08,189
able to control that primarily at first
to improve function not for

9768
03:23:08,189 --> 03:23:08,199
to improve function not for
 

9769
03:23:08,199 --> 03:23:09,870
to improve function not for
entertainment purposes or enjoyment

9770
03:23:09,870 --> 03:23:09,880
entertainment purposes or enjoyment
 

9771
03:23:09,880 --> 03:23:12,189
entertainment purposes or enjoyment
purposes but yeah giving back lost

9772
03:23:12,189 --> 03:23:12,199
purposes but yeah giving back lost
 

9773
03:23:12,199 --> 03:23:15,150
purposes but yeah giving back lost
functions Lo giving back lost functions

9774
03:23:15,150 --> 03:23:15,160
functions Lo giving back lost functions
 

9775
03:23:15,160 --> 03:23:17,070
functions Lo giving back lost functions
and there especially

9776
03:23:17,070 --> 03:23:17,080
and there especially
 

9777
03:23:17,080 --> 03:23:19,349
and there especially
when the function is completely lost

9778
03:23:19,349 --> 03:23:19,359
when the function is completely lost
 

9779
03:23:19,359 --> 03:23:23,189
when the function is completely lost
anything is a huge help would you uh

9780
03:23:23,189 --> 03:23:23,199
anything is a huge help would you uh
 

9781
03:23:23,199 --> 03:23:28,150
anything is a huge help would you uh
implant a neuralink device in your own

9782
03:23:28,150 --> 03:23:28,160
implant a neuralink device in your own
 

9783
03:23:28,160 --> 03:23:30,990
implant a neuralink device in your own
brain absolutely I mean maybe not right

9784
03:23:30,990 --> 03:23:31,000
brain absolutely I mean maybe not right
 

9785
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:33,990
brain absolutely I mean maybe not right
now but absolutely what kind of

9786
03:23:33,990 --> 03:23:34,000
now but absolutely what kind of
 

9787
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:36,469
now but absolutely what kind of
capability once reached you start

9788
03:23:36,469 --> 03:23:36,479
capability once reached you start
 

9789
03:23:36,479 --> 03:23:38,910
capability once reached you start
getting real Curious and almost get a

9790
03:23:38,910 --> 03:23:38,920
getting real Curious and almost get a
 

9791
03:23:38,920 --> 03:23:42,510
getting real Curious and almost get a
little antsy like like jealous of people

9792
03:23:42,510 --> 03:23:42,520
little antsy like like jealous of people
 

9793
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:45,269
little antsy like like jealous of people
that get as you watch them get

9794
03:23:45,269 --> 03:23:45,279
that get as you watch them get
 

9795
03:23:45,279 --> 03:23:47,590
that get as you watch them get
implanted yeah I mean I think I mean

9796
03:23:47,590 --> 03:23:47,600
implanted yeah I mean I think I mean
 

9797
03:23:47,600 --> 03:23:49,710
implanted yeah I mean I think I mean
even even with our early participants if

9798
03:23:49,710 --> 03:23:49,720
even even with our early participants if
 

9799
03:23:49,720 --> 03:23:53,229
even even with our early participants if
they start to do things that I I can't

9800
03:23:53,229 --> 03:23:53,239
they start to do things that I I can't
 

9801
03:23:53,239 --> 03:23:56,070
they start to do things that I I can't
do uh which I think is in the realm of

9802
03:23:56,070 --> 03:23:56,080
do uh which I think is in the realm of
 

9803
03:23:56,080 --> 03:23:58,389
do uh which I think is in the realm of
possibility for them to be able to get

9804
03:23:58,389 --> 03:23:58,399
possibility for them to be able to get
 

9805
03:23:58,399 --> 03:24:02,590
possibility for them to be able to get
you know 15 20 if not like 100 BPS right

9806
03:24:02,590 --> 03:24:02,600
you know 15 20 if not like 100 BPS right
 

9807
03:24:02,600 --> 03:24:04,349
you know 15 20 if not like 100 BPS right
um there's nothing that fundamentally

9808
03:24:04,349 --> 03:24:04,359
um there's nothing that fundamentally
 

9809
03:24:04,359 --> 03:24:06,349
um there's nothing that fundamentally
stops us from being able to achieve that

9810
03:24:06,349 --> 03:24:06,359
stops us from being able to achieve that
 

9811
03:24:06,359 --> 03:24:07,349
stops us from being able to achieve that
type of

9812
03:24:07,349 --> 03:24:07,359
type of
 

9813
03:24:07,359 --> 03:24:08,990
type of
performance

9814
03:24:08,990 --> 03:24:09,000
performance
 

9815
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:11,750
performance
um I mean I would certainly get jealous

9816
03:24:11,750 --> 03:24:11,760
um I mean I would certainly get jealous
 

9817
03:24:11,760 --> 03:24:13,550
um I mean I would certainly get jealous
um that they can do that I I should say

9818
03:24:13,550 --> 03:24:13,560
um that they can do that I I should say
 

9819
03:24:13,560 --> 03:24:14,990
um that they can do that I I should say
that watching no and I get a little

9820
03:24:14,990 --> 03:24:15,000
that watching no and I get a little
 

9821
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:17,349
that watching no and I get a little
jealous because he say so much fun and

9822
03:24:17,349 --> 03:24:17,359
jealous because he say so much fun and
 

9823
03:24:17,359 --> 03:24:19,189
jealous because he say so much fun and
it seems like such a chill way to play

9824
03:24:19,189 --> 03:24:19,199
it seems like such a chill way to play
 

9825
03:24:19,199 --> 03:24:21,910
it seems like such a chill way to play
video games yeah so I mean the thing

9826
03:24:21,910 --> 03:24:21,920
video games yeah so I mean the thing
 

9827
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:23,950
video games yeah so I mean the thing
that also is hard to appreciate

9828
03:24:23,950 --> 03:24:23,960
that also is hard to appreciate
 

9829
03:24:23,960 --> 03:24:26,750
that also is hard to appreciate
sometimes is that you know he's doing

9830
03:24:26,750 --> 03:24:26,760
sometimes is that you know he's doing
 

9831
03:24:26,760 --> 03:24:28,870
sometimes is that you know he's doing
these things while mult like while

9832
03:24:28,870 --> 03:24:28,880
these things while mult like while
 

9833
03:24:28,880 --> 03:24:31,510
these things while mult like while
talking and I mean it's multitasking

9834
03:24:31,510 --> 03:24:31,520
talking and I mean it's multitasking
 

9835
03:24:31,520 --> 03:24:34,389
talking and I mean it's multitasking
right so it's it's clearly it's

9836
03:24:34,389 --> 03:24:34,399
right so it's it's clearly it's
 

9837
03:24:34,399 --> 03:24:36,790
right so it's it's clearly it's
obviously cognitive cognitively uh

9838
03:24:36,790 --> 03:24:36,800
obviously cognitive cognitively uh
 

9839
03:24:36,800 --> 03:24:39,189
obviously cognitive cognitively uh
intensive but similar to how you know

9840
03:24:39,189 --> 03:24:39,199
intensive but similar to how you know
 

9841
03:24:39,199 --> 03:24:40,630
intensive but similar to how you know
when we talk we move our hands like

9842
03:24:40,630 --> 03:24:40,640
when we talk we move our hands like
 

9843
03:24:40,640 --> 03:24:42,830
when we talk we move our hands like
these things like you know like are

9844
03:24:42,830 --> 03:24:42,840
these things like you know like are
 

9845
03:24:42,840 --> 03:24:45,110
these things like you know like are
multitasking I mean he's able to do that

9846
03:24:45,110 --> 03:24:45,120
multitasking I mean he's able to do that
 

9847
03:24:45,120 --> 03:24:46,910
multitasking I mean he's able to do that
and you know you won't be a to do that

9848
03:24:46,910 --> 03:24:46,920
and you know you won't be a to do that
 

9849
03:24:46,920 --> 03:24:49,710
and you know you won't be a to do that
with other assisted technology as far as

9850
03:24:49,710 --> 03:24:49,720
with other assisted technology as far as
 

9851
03:24:49,720 --> 03:24:53,229
with other assisted technology as far as
I I'm aware you know if you're obviously

9852
03:24:53,229 --> 03:24:53,239
I I'm aware you know if you're obviously
 

9853
03:24:53,239 --> 03:24:54,790
I I'm aware you know if you're obviously
using like an ey tracking device you

9854
03:24:54,790 --> 03:24:54,800
using like an ey tracking device you
 

9855
03:24:54,800 --> 03:24:56,670
using like an ey tracking device you
know you're very much fixated on that

9856
03:24:56,670 --> 03:24:56,680
know you're very much fixated on that
 

9857
03:24:56,680 --> 03:24:57,710
know you're very much fixated on that
thing that you're trying to do and if

9858
03:24:57,710 --> 03:24:57,720
thing that you're trying to do and if
 

9859
03:24:57,720 --> 03:24:59,670
thing that you're trying to do and if
you're using voice control I mean like

9860
03:24:59,670 --> 03:24:59,680
you're using voice control I mean like
 

9861
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:01,389
you're using voice control I mean like
if you say some other stuff yeah you

9862
03:25:01,389 --> 03:25:01,399
if you say some other stuff yeah you
 

9863
03:25:01,399 --> 03:25:03,389
if you say some other stuff yeah you
don't get to use that yeah the the

9864
03:25:03,389 --> 03:25:03,399
don't get to use that yeah the the
 

9865
03:25:03,399 --> 03:25:05,469
don't get to use that yeah the the
multitasking aspect of that is really

9866
03:25:05,469 --> 03:25:05,479
multitasking aspect of that is really
 

9867
03:25:05,479 --> 03:25:07,150
multitasking aspect of that is really
interesting so it's not just the

9868
03:25:07,150 --> 03:25:07,160
interesting so it's not just the
 

9869
03:25:07,160 --> 03:25:10,469
interesting so it's not just the
BPS for the primary task it's the it's

9870
03:25:10,469 --> 03:25:10,479
BPS for the primary task it's the it's
 

9871
03:25:10,479 --> 03:25:12,550
BPS for the primary task it's the it's
the parallelization of multiple task if

9872
03:25:12,550 --> 03:25:12,560
the parallelization of multiple task if
 

9873
03:25:12,560 --> 03:25:14,710
the parallelization of multiple task if
you if you take if you measure the BPS

9874
03:25:14,710 --> 03:25:14,720
you if you take if you measure the BPS
 

9875
03:25:14,720 --> 03:25:16,750
you if you take if you measure the BPS
for the entirety of the human organ ISM

9876
03:25:16,750 --> 03:25:16,760
for the entirety of the human organ ISM
 

9877
03:25:16,760 --> 03:25:19,630
for the entirety of the human organ ISM
so if you're talking and doing a thing

9878
03:25:19,630 --> 03:25:19,640
so if you're talking and doing a thing
 

9879
03:25:19,640 --> 03:25:24,070
so if you're talking and doing a thing
with your mind and looking around mhm

9880
03:25:24,070 --> 03:25:24,080
with your mind and looking around mhm
 

9881
03:25:24,080 --> 03:25:26,229
with your mind and looking around mhm
also I mean there's just a lot of

9882
03:25:26,229 --> 03:25:26,239
also I mean there's just a lot of
 

9883
03:25:26,239 --> 03:25:28,389
also I mean there's just a lot of
paralyzation that that can be happening

9884
03:25:28,389 --> 03:25:28,399
paralyzation that that can be happening
 

9885
03:25:28,399 --> 03:25:29,950
paralyzation that that can be happening
but I mean I think at some point for him

9886
03:25:29,950 --> 03:25:29,960
but I mean I think at some point for him
 

9887
03:25:29,960 --> 03:25:31,349
but I mean I think at some point for him
like if he wants to really achieve those

9888
03:25:31,349 --> 03:25:31,359
like if he wants to really achieve those
 

9889
03:25:31,359 --> 03:25:33,630
like if he wants to really achieve those
high level BPS it does require like you

9890
03:25:33,630 --> 03:25:33,640
high level BPS it does require like you
 

9891
03:25:33,640 --> 03:25:35,269
high level BPS it does require like you
know full attention right um and that's

9892
03:25:35,269 --> 03:25:35,279
know full attention right um and that's
 

9893
03:25:35,279 --> 03:25:38,469
know full attention right um and that's
a separate circuitry that that um is a

9894
03:25:38,469 --> 03:25:38,479
a separate circuitry that that um is a
 

9895
03:25:38,479 --> 03:25:40,630
a separate circuitry that that um is a
big mystery like how attention works and

9896
03:25:40,630 --> 03:25:40,640
big mystery like how attention works and
 

9897
03:25:40,640 --> 03:25:42,269
big mystery like how attention works and
you know yeah attention like cognitive

9898
03:25:42,269 --> 03:25:42,279
you know yeah attention like cognitive
 

9899
03:25:42,279 --> 03:25:44,830
you know yeah attention like cognitive
load I've done I've I've read a lot of

9900
03:25:44,830 --> 03:25:44,840
load I've done I've I've read a lot of
 

9901
03:25:44,840 --> 03:25:48,189
load I've done I've I've read a lot of
literature on people doing two tasks mhm

9902
03:25:48,189 --> 03:25:48,199
literature on people doing two tasks mhm
 

9903
03:25:48,199 --> 03:25:50,630
literature on people doing two tasks mhm
like uh you have your primary task and a

9904
03:25:50,630 --> 03:25:50,640
like uh you have your primary task and a
 

9905
03:25:50,640 --> 03:25:52,750
like uh you have your primary task and a
secondary task and the secondary task is

9906
03:25:52,750 --> 03:25:52,760
secondary task and the secondary task is
 

9907
03:25:52,760 --> 03:25:54,910
secondary task and the secondary task is
is a source of distraction and how does

9908
03:25:54,910 --> 03:25:54,920
is a source of distraction and how does
 

9909
03:25:54,920 --> 03:25:56,110
is a source of distraction and how does
that affect the performance on the

9910
03:25:56,110 --> 03:25:56,120
that affect the performance on the
 

9911
03:25:56,120 --> 03:25:57,550
that affect the performance on the
primary task and there's depending on

9912
03:25:57,550 --> 03:25:57,560
primary task and there's depending on
 

9913
03:25:57,560 --> 03:25:59,790
primary task and there's depending on
the task there's a lot of interesting I

9914
03:25:59,790 --> 03:25:59,800
the task there's a lot of interesting I
 

9915
03:25:59,800 --> 03:26:00,830
the task there's a lot of interesting I
mean this is an interesting

9916
03:26:00,830 --> 03:26:00,840
mean this is an interesting
 

9917
03:26:00,840 --> 03:26:03,590
mean this is an interesting
computational device right and I think

9918
03:26:03,590 --> 03:26:03,600
computational device right and I think
 

9919
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:05,990
computational device right and I think
there's to say the least a lot of Novel

9920
03:26:05,990 --> 03:26:06,000
there's to say the least a lot of Novel
 

9921
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:07,269
there's to say the least a lot of Novel
insights that can be gained from

9922
03:26:07,269 --> 03:26:07,279
insights that can be gained from
 

9923
03:26:07,279 --> 03:26:08,550
insights that can be gained from
everything I mean I personally am

9924
03:26:08,550 --> 03:26:08,560
everything I mean I personally am
 

9925
03:26:08,560 --> 03:26:12,150
everything I mean I personally am
surprised that no one's able to do such

9926
03:26:12,150 --> 03:26:12,160
surprised that no one's able to do such
 

9927
03:26:12,160 --> 03:26:14,309
surprised that no one's able to do such
incredible control of the cursor while

9928
03:26:14,309 --> 03:26:14,319
incredible control of the cursor while
 

9929
03:26:14,319 --> 03:26:16,950
incredible control of the cursor while
talking and also being nervous at the

9930
03:26:16,950 --> 03:26:16,960
talking and also being nervous at the
 

9931
03:26:16,960 --> 03:26:18,550
talking and also being nervous at the
same time because he's talking like all

9932
03:26:18,550 --> 03:26:18,560
same time because he's talking like all
 

9933
03:26:18,560 --> 03:26:19,790
same time because he's talking like all
of us Sor if you're talking in front of

9934
03:26:19,790 --> 03:26:19,800
of us Sor if you're talking in front of
 

9935
03:26:19,800 --> 03:26:22,150
of us Sor if you're talking in front of
the camera you get nervous so all of

9936
03:26:22,150 --> 03:26:22,160
the camera you get nervous so all of
 

9937
03:26:22,160 --> 03:26:24,389
the camera you get nervous so all of
those are coming into play he's able to

9938
03:26:24,389 --> 03:26:24,399
those are coming into play he's able to
 

9939
03:26:24,399 --> 03:26:26,349
those are coming into play he's able to
still achieve high

9940
03:26:26,349 --> 03:26:26,359
still achieve high
 

9941
03:26:26,359 --> 03:26:28,590
still achieve high
performance surprising I mean all of

9942
03:26:28,590 --> 03:26:28,600
performance surprising I mean all of
 

9943
03:26:28,600 --> 03:26:32,429
performance surprising I mean all of
this is really amazing uh and I think at

9944
03:26:32,429 --> 03:26:32,439
this is really amazing uh and I think at
 

9945
03:26:32,439 --> 03:26:34,710
this is really amazing uh and I think at
just after researching this really in

9946
03:26:34,710 --> 03:26:34,720
just after researching this really in
 

9947
03:26:34,720 --> 03:26:37,309
just after researching this really in
depth I kind of wanted your

9948
03:26:37,309 --> 03:26:37,319
depth I kind of wanted your
 

9949
03:26:37,319 --> 03:26:40,550
depth I kind of wanted your
link get in the line and also the safy

9950
03:26:40,550 --> 03:26:40,560
link get in the line and also the safy
 

9951
03:26:40,560 --> 03:26:42,349
link get in the line and also the safy
get in mind well we should say the

9952
03:26:42,349 --> 03:26:42,359
get in mind well we should say the
 

9953
03:26:42,359 --> 03:26:44,510
get in mind well we should say the
registry is for people who have

9954
03:26:44,510 --> 03:26:44,520
registry is for people who have
 

9955
03:26:44,520 --> 03:26:46,469
registry is for people who have
quadriplegia and all that kind of stuff

9956
03:26:46,469 --> 03:26:46,479
quadriplegia and all that kind of stuff
 

9957
03:26:46,479 --> 03:26:50,349
quadriplegia and all that kind of stuff
so there'll be a separate line for

9958
03:26:50,349 --> 03:26:50,359
so there'll be a separate line for
 

9959
03:26:50,359 --> 03:26:54,630
so there'll be a separate line for
people um they're just

9960
03:26:54,630 --> 03:26:54,640
people um they're just
 

9961
03:26:54,640 --> 03:26:58,590
people um they're just
curious uh like myself so now that noan

9962
03:26:58,590 --> 03:26:58,600
curious uh like myself so now that noan
 

9963
03:26:58,600 --> 03:27:01,070
curious uh like myself so now that noan
patient P1 is part of the ongoing Prime

9964
03:27:01,070 --> 03:27:01,080
patient P1 is part of the ongoing Prime
 

9965
03:27:01,080 --> 03:27:03,790
patient P1 is part of the ongoing Prime
study um what's the high level vision

9966
03:27:03,790 --> 03:27:03,800
study um what's the high level vision
 

9967
03:27:03,800 --> 03:27:08,870
study um what's the high level vision
for P2 P3 P4 P5 and just uh the

9968
03:27:08,870 --> 03:27:08,880
for P2 P3 P4 P5 and just uh the
 

9969
03:27:08,880 --> 03:27:11,269
for P2 P3 P4 P5 and just uh the

device improve the surgery before you
 

10027
03:28:28,120 --> 03:28:29,469
device improve the surgery before you
know we embark on what's called a

10028
03:28:29,469 --> 03:28:29,479
know we embark on what's called a
 

10029
03:28:29,479 --> 03:28:34,550
know we embark on what's called a
pivotal study that then is a much larger

10030
03:28:34,550 --> 03:28:34,560
pivotal study that then is a much larger
 

10031
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:37,830
pivotal study that then is a much larger
um uh trial that starts to look at

10032
03:28:37,830 --> 03:28:37,840
um uh trial that starts to look at
 

10033
03:28:37,840 --> 03:28:39,710
um uh trial that starts to look at
statistical significance of your

10034
03:28:39,710 --> 03:28:39,720
statistical significance of your
 

10035
03:28:39,720 --> 03:28:41,950
statistical significance of your
endpoints um and that's required before

10036
03:28:41,950 --> 03:28:41,960
endpoints um and that's required before
 

10037
03:28:41,960 --> 03:28:45,189
endpoints um and that's required before
you can then Market the device um uh and

10038
03:28:45,189 --> 03:28:45,199
you can then Market the device um uh and
 

10039
03:28:45,199 --> 03:28:46,349
you can then Market the device um uh and
and you know that's how it works in the

10040
03:28:46,349 --> 03:28:46,359
and you know that's how it works in the
 

10041
03:28:46,359 --> 03:28:48,030
and you know that's how it works in the
US and just generally around the world

10042
03:28:48,030 --> 03:28:48,040
US and just generally around the world
 

10043
03:28:48,040 --> 03:28:50,870
US and just generally around the world
that's that's the process you follow so

10044
03:28:50,870 --> 03:28:50,880
that's that's the process you follow so
 

10045
03:28:50,880 --> 03:28:52,670
that's that's the process you follow so
you know our goal is to really just

10046
03:28:52,670 --> 03:28:52,680
you know our goal is to really just
 

10047
03:28:52,680 --> 03:28:55,150
you know our goal is to really just
understand from people like Nolan P2 P3

10048
03:28:55,150 --> 03:28:55,160
understand from people like Nolan P2 P3
 

10049
03:28:55,160 --> 03:28:57,710
understand from people like Nolan P2 P3
future participants what aspects of our

10050
03:28:57,710 --> 03:28:57,720
future participants what aspects of our
 

10051
03:28:57,720 --> 03:28:59,590
future participants what aspects of our
device needs to improve you know if if

10052
03:28:59,590 --> 03:28:59,600
device needs to improve you know if if
 

10053
03:28:59,600 --> 03:29:01,269
device needs to improve you know if if
it turns out that people are like I

10054
03:29:01,269 --> 03:29:01,279
it turns out that people are like I
 

10055
03:29:01,279 --> 03:29:02,710
it turns out that people are like I
really don't like the fact that it lasts

10056
03:29:02,710 --> 03:29:02,720
really don't like the fact that it lasts
 

10057
03:29:02,720 --> 03:29:04,670
really don't like the fact that it lasts
only 6 hours I want to be able to use

10058
03:29:04,670 --> 03:29:04,680
only 6 hours I want to be able to use
 

10059
03:29:04,680 --> 03:29:08,269
only 6 hours I want to be able to use
this computer for you know like 24 hours

10060
03:29:08,269 --> 03:29:08,279
this computer for you know like 24 hours
 

10061
03:29:08,279 --> 03:29:11,349
this computer for you know like 24 hours
I mean that's that is a you know user

10062
03:29:11,349 --> 03:29:11,359
I mean that's that is a you know user
 

10063
03:29:11,359 --> 03:29:13,830
I mean that's that is a you know user
needs and user requirements uh which we

10064
03:29:13,830 --> 03:29:13,840
needs and user requirements uh which we
 

10065
03:29:13,840 --> 03:29:16,110
needs and user requirements uh which we
can only find out from just just being

10066
03:29:16,110 --> 03:29:16,120
can only find out from just just being
 

10067
03:29:16,120 --> 03:29:17,790
can only find out from just just being
able to engage with them so before the

10068
03:29:17,790 --> 03:29:17,800
able to engage with them so before the
 

10069
03:29:17,800 --> 03:29:19,510
able to engage with them so before the
pivotal study there's kind of like a

10070
03:29:19,510 --> 03:29:19,520
pivotal study there's kind of like a
 

10071
03:29:19,520 --> 03:29:21,309
pivotal study there's kind of like a
rapid Innovation based on individual

10072
03:29:21,309 --> 03:29:21,319
rapid Innovation based on individual
 

10073
03:29:21,319 --> 03:29:22,710
rapid Innovation based on individual
experiences you're learning from

10074
03:29:22,710 --> 03:29:22,720
experiences you're learning from
 

10075
03:29:22,720 --> 03:29:25,229
experiences you're learning from
Individual people how they use it like

10076
03:29:25,229 --> 03:29:25,239
Individual people how they use it like
 

10077
03:29:25,239 --> 03:29:28,710
Individual people how they use it like
the like the high resolution details in

10078
03:29:28,710 --> 03:29:28,720
the like the high resolution details in
 

10079
03:29:28,720 --> 03:29:30,510
the like the high resolution details in
terms of like cursor control and signal

10080
03:29:30,510 --> 03:29:30,520
terms of like cursor control and signal
 

10081
03:29:30,520 --> 03:29:32,510
terms of like cursor control and signal
and all that kind of stuff to like life

10082
03:29:32,510 --> 03:29:32,520
and all that kind of stuff to like life
 

10083
03:29:32,520 --> 03:29:34,309
and all that kind of stuff to like life
experience yeah so there's Hardware

10084
03:29:34,309 --> 03:29:34,319
experience yeah so there's Hardware
 

10085
03:29:34,319 --> 03:29:36,469
experience yeah so there's Hardware
changes but also just just firmware

10086
03:29:36,469 --> 03:29:36,479
changes but also just just firmware
 

10087
03:29:36,479 --> 03:29:39,510
changes but also just just firmware
updates um so even even when we um you

10088
03:29:39,510 --> 03:29:39,520
updates um so even even when we um you
 

10089
03:29:39,520 --> 03:29:41,990
updates um so even even when we um you
know had had that sort of uh recovery

10090
03:29:41,990 --> 03:29:42,000
know had had that sort of uh recovery
 

10091
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:44,429
know had had that sort of uh recovery
event for Nolan uh you know he now has

10092
03:29:44,429 --> 03:29:44,439
event for Nolan uh you know he now has
 

10093
03:29:44,439 --> 03:29:47,510
event for Nolan uh you know he now has
the new firmware that that that he um

10094
03:29:47,510 --> 03:29:47,520
the new firmware that that that he um
 

10095
03:29:47,520 --> 03:29:50,429
the new firmware that that that he um
has been uh updated with and you know

has been uh updated with and you know
 

10097
03:29:50,439 --> 03:29:52,150
has been uh updated with and you know
it's similar to how like your phones get

10098
03:29:52,150 --> 03:29:52,160
it's similar to how like your phones get
 

10099
03:29:52,160 --> 03:29:53,870
it's similar to how like your phones get
updated all the time with new firmwares

10100

functionality UI right um and that's
 

10105
03:29:57,960 --> 03:29:59,510
functionality UI right um and that's
something that is possible with our

10106
03:29:59,510 --> 03:29:59,520
something that is possible with our
 

10107
03:29:59,520 --> 03:30:01,710
something that is possible with our
implant it's not a static one-time

10108

10125
03:30:19,439 --> 03:30:21,229
right uh that's that's that's um you
know when we say generalized platform

10126
03:30:21,229 --> 03:30:21,239
know when we say generalized platform
 

10127
03:30:21,239 --> 03:30:22,510
know when we say generalized platform
that's what we're talking about yeah

10128
03:30:22,510 --> 03:30:22,520
that's what we're talking about yeah
 

10129
03:30:22,520 --> 03:30:24,030
that's what we're talking about yeah
it's really cool how the the app that

10130
03:30:24,030 --> 03:30:24,040
it's really cool how the the app that
 

10131
03:30:24,040 --> 03:30:26,229
it's really cool how the the app that
Nolan is using there's like

10132
03:30:26,229 --> 03:30:26,239
Nolan is using there's like
 

10133
03:30:26,239 --> 03:30:28,349
Nolan is using there's like
calibration all that all that kind of

10134

like to those machines um so we're
 

10181
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:25,150
like to those machines um so we're
looking at ways to kind of expand those

10182
03:31:25,150 --> 03:31:25,160
looking at ways to kind of expand those
 

10183

types of capability even for Nolan um

10184
03:31:27,950 --> 03:31:27,960
types of capability even for Nolan um
 

10185
03:31:27,960 --> 03:31:29,710
types of capability even for Nolan um
that requires you know conversation with

10186
03:31:29,710 --> 03:31:29,720
that requires you know conversation with
 

10187
03:31:29,720 --> 03:31:32,269
that requires you know conversation with
the FDA and kind of showing safety data

10188
03:31:32,269 --> 03:31:32,279
the FDA and kind of showing safety data
 

10189
03:31:32,279 --> 03:31:34,710
the FDA and kind of showing safety data
for you know if there's a robotic arm or

10190
03:31:34,710 --> 03:31:34,720
for you know if there's a robotic arm or
 

10191
03:31:34,720 --> 03:31:36,309
for you know if there's a robotic arm or
wheelchair that you know we can

10192
03:31:36,309 --> 03:31:36,319
wheelchair that you know we can
 

10193
03:31:36,319 --> 03:31:37,550
wheelchair that you know we can
guarantee that they're not going to hurt

10194
03:31:37,550 --> 03:31:37,560
guarantee that they're not going to hurt
 

10195
03:31:37,560 --> 03:31:39,630
guarantee that they're not going to hurt
themselves accidentally right um it's

10196
03:31:39,630 --> 03:31:39,640
themselves accidentally right um it's
 

10197
03:31:39,640 --> 03:31:41,229
themselves accidentally right um it's
very different if you're moving stuff in

10198
03:31:41,229 --> 03:31:41,239
very different if you're moving stuff in
 

10199
03:31:41,239 --> 03:31:42,790
very different if you're moving stuff in
the in the digital domain versus like in

10200
03:31:42,790 --> 03:31:42,800
the in the digital domain versus like in
 

10201
03:31:42,800 --> 03:31:45,269
the in the digital domain versus like in
the physical space you can actually um

10202
03:31:45,269 --> 03:31:45,279
the physical space you can actually um
 

10203
03:31:45,279 --> 03:31:48,070
the physical space you can actually um
potentially harm to the participants um

10204
03:31:48,070 --> 03:31:48,080
potentially harm to the participants um
 

10205
03:31:48,080 --> 03:31:50,309
potentially harm to the participants um
so we're working through that right now

10206
03:31:50,309 --> 03:31:50,319
so we're working through that right now
 

10207
03:31:50,319 --> 03:31:53,150
so we're working through that right now

it those are actually looking more at
 

10231
03:32:19,319 --> 03:32:20,990
it those are actually looking more at
parts of the motor cortex that are

10232

03:32:41,750 --> 03:32:41,760
those are still very very big mystery in
 

10249
03:32:41,760 --> 03:32:43,990
those are still very very big mystery in
terms of the the underlying mechanism of

terms of the the underlying mechanism of
 

10251
03:32:44,000 --> 03:32:46,550
terms of the the underlying mechanism of
how all that stuff works but

10252
03:32:46,550 --> 03:32:46,560
how all that stuff works but
 

10253
03:32:46,560 --> 03:32:49,070
how all that stuff works but
um yeah I mean I think I think neural

10254
03:32:49,070 --> 03:32:49,080
um yeah I mean I think I think neural

questions um do you think we can start
 

10267
03:33:02,720 --> 03:33:06,110
questions um do you think we can start
getting insight into things like

10268

getting insight into things like
 

10269
03:33:06,120 --> 03:33:10,030
getting insight into things like
thought so speech is uh there's a

10270
03:33:10,030 --> 03:33:10,040
thought so speech is uh there's a
 

10271
03:33:10,040 --> 03:33:12,070
thought so speech is uh there's a
muscular component like you said there's

10272
03:33:12,070 --> 03:33:12,080
muscular component like you said there's
 

10273
03:33:12,080 --> 03:33:14,910
muscular component like you said there's
like the act of producing sounds but

10274
03:33:14,910 --> 03:33:14,920
like the act of producing sounds but
 

10275
03:33:14,920 --> 03:33:18,590
like the act of producing sounds but
then what about the internal things like

10276
03:33:18,590 --> 03:33:18,600
then what about the internal things like
 

10277
03:33:18,600 --> 03:33:20,870
then what about the internal things like
cognition like lowlevel thoughts and

10278
03:33:20,870 --> 03:33:20,880
cognition like lowlevel thoughts and
 

10279
03:33:20,880 --> 03:33:22,110
cognition like lowlevel thoughts and
high level thoughts do you think we'll

10280
03:33:22,110 --> 03:33:22,120
high level thoughts do you think we'll
 

10281
03:33:22,120 --> 03:33:24,389
high level thoughts do you think we'll
start noticing kind of signals that

10282
03:33:24,389 --> 03:33:24,399
start noticing kind of signals that
 

10283
03:33:24,399 --> 03:33:27,870
start noticing kind of signals that
could be picked up they could

10284
03:33:27,870 --> 03:33:27,880
could be picked up they could
 

10285
03:33:27,880 --> 03:33:29,910
could be picked up they could
um they could be understood they could

10286
03:33:29,910 --> 03:33:29,920
um they could be understood they could
 

10287
03:33:29,920 --> 03:33:33,229
um they could be understood they could
be maybe used in order to interact with

10288
03:33:33,229 --> 03:33:33,239
be maybe used in order to interact with
 

10289
03:33:33,239 --> 03:33:34,870
be maybe used in order to interact with
the outside

10290
03:33:34,870 --> 03:33:34,880
the outside
 

10291
03:33:34,880 --> 03:33:37,389
the outside
world in some ways like I guess this

10292
03:33:37,389 --> 03:33:37,399
world in some ways like I guess this
 

10293
03:33:37,399 --> 03:33:39,429
world in some ways like I guess this
starts to kind of get into the hard

10294
03:33:39,429 --> 03:33:39,439
starts to kind of get into the hard
 

10295
03:33:39,439 --> 03:33:44,469
starts to kind of get into the hard
problem of Consciousness um and

10296
03:33:44,469 --> 03:33:44,479
problem of Consciousness um and
 

10297
03:33:44,479 --> 03:33:46,309
problem of Consciousness um and
uh I mean

10298
03:33:46,309 --> 03:33:46,319
uh I mean
 

10299
03:33:46,319 --> 03:33:49,790
uh I mean
on on one hand all of these are at some

10300
03:33:49,790 --> 03:33:49,800
on on one hand all of these are at some
 

10301
03:33:49,800 --> 03:33:52,229
on on one hand all of these are at some
point set of electrical

10302
03:33:52,229 --> 03:33:52,239
point set of electrical
 

10303
03:33:52,239 --> 03:33:54,429
point set of electrical
signals that

10304
03:33:54,429 --> 03:33:54,439
signals that
 

10305
03:33:54,439 --> 03:33:56,630
signals that
um from

10306
03:33:56,630 --> 03:33:56,640
um from
 

10307
03:33:56,640 --> 03:34:00,590
um from
there maybe it it in itself is giving

10308
03:34:00,590 --> 03:34:00,600
there maybe it it in itself is giving
 

10309
03:34:00,600 --> 03:34:02,870
there maybe it it in itself is giving
you the cognition or the meaning or

10310
03:34:02,870 --> 03:34:02,880
you the cognition or the meaning or
 

10311
03:34:02,880 --> 03:34:06,550
you the cognition or the meaning or
somehow human mind is incredibly amazing

10312
03:34:06,550 --> 03:34:06,560
somehow human mind is incredibly amazing
 

10313
03:34:06,560 --> 03:34:08,990
somehow human mind is incredibly amazing
storytelling machine so we're telling

10314
03:34:08,990 --> 03:34:09,000
storytelling machine so we're telling
 

10315
03:34:09,000 --> 03:34:10,429

03:34:10,429 --> 03:34:10,439
ourselves and fooling ourselves that
 

10317
03:34:10,439 --> 03:34:13,710

there's some interesting meaning here um

10318
03:34:13,710 --> 03:34:13,720
there's some interesting meaning here um
 

10319
03:34:13,720 --> 03:34:15,830
there's some interesting meaning here um
but

10320
03:34:15,830 --> 03:34:15,840
but
 

10321
03:34:15,840 --> 03:34:19,670
but
I I I I certainly think that BCI and you

I I I I certainly think that BCI and you
 

10323
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:21,110
I I I I certainly think that BCI and you
know really BCI at the end of the day is

03:34:21,110 --> 03:34:21,120
know really BCI at the end of the day is
 

10325
03:34:21,120 --> 03:34:23,269

a set of tools that help you kind of

10326
03:34:23,269 --> 03:34:23,279
a set of tools that help you kind of
 

10327
03:34:23,279 --> 03:34:26,070
a set of tools that help you kind of
study the underlying mechanisms in in a

10328
03:34:26,070 --> 03:34:26,080
study the underlying mechanisms in in a
 

10329

both like local but also broader sense
 

10331
03:34:29,680 --> 03:34:32,790
both like local but also broader sense
um and whether you know there's some

10332
03:34:32,790 --> 03:34:32,800
um and whether you know there's some
 

10333
03:34:32,800 --> 03:34:35,070
um and whether you know there's some
interesting patterns of like electrical

10334
03:34:35,070 --> 03:34:35,080
interesting patterns of like electrical
 

10335
03:34:35,080 --> 03:34:37,070

this versus and you can either like
 

10339
03:34:39,880 --> 03:34:42,670

learn from like many many sets of data

10340
03:34:42,670 --> 03:34:42,680
learn from like many many sets of data
 

10341
03:34:42,680 --> 03:34:44,150
learn from like many many sets of data
to correlate some of that and be able to

10342
03:34:44,150 --> 03:34:44,160
to correlate some of that and be able to
 

10343
03:34:44,160 --> 03:34:45,830
to correlate some of that and be able to
do mind reading or not I'm not I'm not

03:34:45,830 --> 03:34:45,840
do mind reading or not I'm not I'm not
 

10345
03:34:45,840 --> 03:34:49,269
do mind reading or not I'm not I'm not
sure um I certainly would not kind of

10346
03:34:49,269 --> 03:34:49,279
sure um I certainly would not kind of
 

10347
03:34:49,279 --> 03:34:52,910
sure um I certainly would not kind of
blow that out as a possibility but um I

10348
03:34:52,910 --> 03:34:52,920
blow that out as a possibility but um I
 

10349
03:34:52,920 --> 03:34:55,750
blow that out as a possibility but um I
I I think BCI alone probably can't do

10350
03:34:55,750 --> 03:34:55,760
I I think BCI alone probably can't do
 

10351
03:34:55,760 --> 03:34:57,510
I I think BCI alone probably can't do
that there's probably additional set of

03:34:57,510 --> 03:34:57,520
that there's probably additional set of
 

10353
03:34:57,520 --> 03:35:00,670
that there's probably additional set of
tools and framework and you also like

10354
03:35:00,670 --> 03:35:00,680
tools and framework and you also like
 

10355
03:35:00,680 --> 03:35:02,830
tools and framework and you also like
just hard problem of Consciousness at

10356
03:35:02,830 --> 03:35:02,840
just hard problem of Consciousness at
 

10357
03:35:02,840 --> 03:35:04,590
just hard problem of Consciousness at
the end of the day is rooted in this

10358

the end of the day is rooted in this
 

10359
03:35:04,600 --> 03:35:06,229
the end of the day is rooted in this
philosophical question of like what is

03:35:06,229 --> 03:35:06,239
philosophical question of like what is
 

10361
03:35:06,239 --> 03:35:07,630
philosophical question of like what is
the what's the meaning of it all what's

03:35:07,630 --> 03:35:07,640
the what's the meaning of it all what's
 

10363
03:35:07,640 --> 03:35:09,670
the what's the meaning of it all what's
the nature of our existence like where

10364
03:35:09,670 --> 03:35:09,680
the nature of our existence like where
 

10365
03:35:09,680 --> 03:35:11,469
the nature of our existence like where
is the Mind emerg from this complex

10366
03:35:11,469 --> 03:35:11,479
is the Mind emerg from this complex

just a bunch of spikes electrical spikes
 

10375
03:35:21,279 --> 03:35:23,229
just a bunch of spikes electrical spikes
yeah yeah I mean we we do really think

10376
03:35:23,229 --> 03:35:23,239
yeah yeah I mean we we do really think
 

10377
03:35:23,239 --> 03:35:25,150
yeah yeah I mean we we do really think
about BCI and what we're building as a

10378
03:35:25,150 --> 03:35:25,160
about BCI and what we're building as a
 

10379
03:35:25,160 --> 03:35:26,910
about BCI and what we're building as a

brain the only question that
 

10385
03:35:32,160 --> 03:35:35,150
brain the only question that
matters there's actually um there

03:35:35,150 --> 03:35:35,160
matters there's actually um there
 

10387
03:35:35,160 --> 03:35:38,349
matters there's actually um there
actually is um some

10388
03:35:38,349 --> 03:35:38,359
actually is um some
 

10389
03:35:38,359 --> 03:35:41,670
actually is um some
biological existence proof of like what

10390
03:35:41,670 --> 03:35:41,680
biological existence proof of like what
 

10391
03:35:41,680 --> 03:35:43,590
biological existence proof of like what
it would take to kind of start to form

10392
03:35:43,590 --> 03:35:43,600
it would take to kind of start to form
 

10393
03:35:43,600 --> 03:35:45,790
it would take to kind of start to form
some of these experiences that maybe

10394
03:35:45,790 --> 03:35:45,800
some of these experiences that maybe
 

10395
03:35:45,800 --> 03:35:49,030
some of these experiences that maybe
unique um if you actually look at every

10396
03:35:49,030 --> 03:35:49,040
unique um if you actually look at every
 

10397
03:35:49,040 --> 03:35:51,189
unique um if you actually look at every
one of our brains there there two

10398
03:35:51,189 --> 03:35:51,199
one of our brains there there two
 

10399
03:35:51,199 --> 03:35:52,870
one of our brains there there two
hemispheres there's a left sided brain

10400
03:35:52,870 --> 03:35:52,880
hemispheres there's a left sided brain
 

10401
03:35:52,880 --> 03:35:57,150
hemispheres there's a left sided brain
there's a right sided brain and I mean I

10402
03:35:57,150 --> 03:35:57,160
there's a right sided brain and I mean I
 

10403
03:35:57,160 --> 03:36:00,030
there's a right sided brain and I mean I
unless you have some other conditions

10404
03:36:00,030 --> 03:36:00,040
unless you have some other conditions
 

10405
03:36:00,040 --> 03:36:03,349
unless you have some other conditions
you normally don't feel like left leg or

10406
03:36:03,349 --> 03:36:03,359
you normally don't feel like left leg or
 

10407
03:36:03,359 --> 03:36:05,590
you normally don't feel like left leg or
right legs MH like you just feel like

10408
03:36:05,590 --> 03:36:05,600
right legs MH like you just feel like
 

10409
03:36:05,600 --> 03:36:08,710
right legs MH like you just feel like
one legs right so what is happening

10410
03:36:08,710 --> 03:36:08,720
one legs right so what is happening
 

10411
03:36:08,720 --> 03:36:11,389
one legs right so what is happening
there right um if you actually look

10412
03:36:11,389 --> 03:36:11,399
there right um if you actually look
 

10413
03:36:11,399 --> 03:36:15,110
there right um if you actually look
at the two hemispheres there's a a

10414
03:36:15,110 --> 03:36:15,120
at the two hemispheres there's a a
 

10415
03:36:15,120 --> 03:36:17,110
at the two hemispheres there's a a
structure that kind of connectorized the

10416
03:36:17,110 --> 03:36:17,120
structure that kind of connectorized the
 

10417
03:36:17,120 --> 03:36:20,150
structure that kind of connectorized the
two called the Corpus colossum that is

10418
03:36:20,150 --> 03:36:20,160
two called the Corpus colossum that is
 

10419
03:36:20,160 --> 03:36:23,349
two called the Corpus colossum that is
supposed to have around 200 to 300

10420
03:36:23,349 --> 03:36:23,359
supposed to have around 200 to 300
 

10421
03:36:23,359 --> 03:36:25,389
supposed to have around 200 to 300
million connections or

10422
03:36:25,389 --> 03:36:25,399
million connections or
 

10423
03:36:25,399 --> 03:36:28,950
million connections or
axons um so whether that means that's

10424
03:36:28,950 --> 03:36:28,960
axons um so whether that means that's
 

10425
03:36:28,960 --> 03:36:32,269
axons um so whether that means that's
the the number of interface and electrod

10426
03:36:32,269 --> 03:36:32,279
the the number of interface and electrod
 

10427
03:36:32,279 --> 03:36:34,990
the the number of interface and electrod
that we need to create some sort of Mind

10428
03:36:34,990 --> 03:36:35,000
that we need to create some sort of Mind
 

10429
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:38,389
that we need to create some sort of Mind
meld or from that like whatever new

10430
03:36:38,389 --> 03:36:38,399
meld or from that like whatever new
 

10431
03:36:38,399 --> 03:36:40,510
meld or from that like whatever new
conscious experience that you you can

10432
03:36:40,510 --> 03:36:40,520
conscious experience that you you can
 

10433
03:36:40,520 --> 03:36:44,750
conscious experience that you you can
experience um but yeah I do think that

10434
03:36:44,750 --> 03:36:44,760
experience um but yeah I do think that
 

10435
03:36:44,760 --> 03:36:47,870
experience um but yeah I do think that
there's like kind of interesting um

10436
03:36:47,870 --> 03:36:47,880
there's like kind of interesting um
 

10437
03:36:47,880 --> 03:36:49,229
there's like kind of interesting um
existence

10438
03:36:49,229 --> 03:36:49,239
existence
 

10439
03:36:49,239 --> 03:36:51,630
existence
proof that we all

10440
03:36:51,630 --> 03:36:51,640
proof that we all
 

10441
03:36:51,640 --> 03:36:54,269
proof that we all
have and that threshold is unknown at

10442
03:36:54,269 --> 03:36:54,279
have and that threshold is unknown at
 

10443
03:36:54,279 --> 03:36:56,550
have and that threshold is unknown at
this time oh yeah these things

10444
03:36:56,550 --> 03:36:56,560
this time oh yeah these things
 

10445
03:36:56,560 --> 03:36:58,550
this time oh yeah these things
everything in this domain is you know

10446
03:36:58,550 --> 03:36:58,560
everything in this domain is you know
 

10447
03:36:58,560 --> 03:37:02,150
everything in this domain is you know
speculation right um and then there will

10448
03:37:02,150 --> 03:37:02,160
speculation right um and then there will
 

10449
03:37:02,160 --> 03:37:07,510
speculation right um and then there will
be uh you'd be continuously pleasantly

10450
03:37:07,510 --> 03:37:07,520

 

10451
03:37:07,520 --> 03:37:09,990

surprised uh do you see a world where

10452
03:37:09,990 --> 03:37:10,000
surprised uh do you see a world where
 

10453
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:12,229
surprised uh do you see a world where
there's millions of

10454
03:37:12,229 --> 03:37:12,239
there's millions of
 

10455
03:37:12,239 --> 03:37:14,670
there's millions of
people like tens of millions hundreds of

10456
03:37:14,670 --> 03:37:14,680
people like tens of millions hundreds of
 

10457
03:37:14,680 --> 03:37:16,110
people like tens of millions hundreds of
millions of people walk

10458
03:37:16,110 --> 03:37:16,120
millions of people walk
 

10459
03:37:16,120 --> 03:37:17,950
millions of people walk
around with the neuralink device in

10460
03:37:17,950 --> 03:37:17,960
around with the neuralink device in
 

10461
03:37:17,960 --> 03:37:19,830
around with the neuralink device in
their or multiple neuralink devices in

10462
03:37:19,830 --> 03:37:19,840
their or multiple neuralink devices in
 

10463
03:37:19,840 --> 03:37:22,309
their or multiple neuralink devices in
their brain I do first of all there

10464
03:37:22,309 --> 03:37:22,319
their brain I do first of all there
 

10465
03:37:22,319 --> 03:37:24,750
their brain I do first of all there
there are like if you look at worldwide

10466
03:37:24,750 --> 03:37:24,760
there are like if you look at worldwide
 

10467
03:37:24,760 --> 03:37:26,309
there are like if you look at worldwide
um people suffering from movement

10468
03:37:26,309 --> 03:37:26,319
um people suffering from movement
 

10469
03:37:26,319 --> 03:37:30,070
um people suffering from movement
disorders and visual defis I mean that

10470
03:37:30,070 --> 03:37:30,080
disorders and visual defis I mean that
 

10471
03:37:30,080 --> 03:37:33,469
disorders and visual defis I mean that
that's uh in the tens if not hundreds of

10472
03:37:33,469 --> 03:37:33,479
that's uh in the tens if not hundreds of
 

10473
03:37:33,479 --> 03:37:36,710
that's uh in the tens if not hundreds of
millions of people um so that that alone

10474
03:37:36,710 --> 03:37:36,720
millions of people um so that that alone
 

10475
03:37:36,720 --> 03:37:39,870
millions of people um so that that alone
I think there's a lot of uh benefit and

10476
03:37:39,870 --> 03:37:39,880
I think there's a lot of uh benefit and
 

10477
03:37:39,880 --> 03:37:42,070
I think there's a lot of uh benefit and
and potential good that we can do with

10478
03:37:42,070 --> 03:37:42,080
and potential good that we can do with
 

10479
03:37:42,080 --> 03:37:44,150
and potential good that we can do with
this type of

03:40:02,640 --> 03:40:05,550
the perception of them and their
relative values and you know the

10586
03:40:05,550 --> 03:40:05,560
relative values and you know the
 

10587
03:40:05,560 --> 03:40:07,269
relative values and you know the
solutions to all our problems and all of

10588
03:40:07,269 --> 03:40:07,279
solutions to all our problems and all of
 

10589
03:40:07,279 --> 03:40:09,269
solutions to all our problems and all of
our problems are all contained in the

10590
03:40:09,269 --> 03:40:09,279
our problems are all contained in the
 

10591
03:40:09,279 --> 03:40:14,150
our problems are all contained in the
skull and if we knew more about how that

10592
03:40:14,150 --> 03:40:14,160
skull and if we knew more about how that
 

10593
03:40:14,160 --> 03:40:17,150
skull and if we knew more about how that
worked uh how the brain encodes

10594
03:40:17,150 --> 03:40:17,160
worked uh how the brain encodes
 

10595
03:40:17,160 --> 03:40:20,750
worked uh how the brain encodes
information and generates desires and

10596
03:40:20,750 --> 03:40:20,760
information and generates desires and
 

10597
03:40:20,760 --> 03:40:22,790
information and generates desires and
generates Agony and

10598
03:40:22,790 --> 03:40:22,800
generates Agony and
 

10599
03:40:22,800 --> 03:40:26,429
generates Agony and
suffering uh we we could do more about

10600
03:40:26,429 --> 03:40:26,439
suffering uh we we could do more about
 

10601
03:40:26,439 --> 03:40:28,830
suffering uh we we could do more about
it you know you think about all the all

10602
03:40:28,830 --> 03:40:28,840
it you know you think about all the all
 

10603
03:40:28,840 --> 03:40:30,389
it you know you think about all the all
the really great triumphs in human

10604
03:40:30,389 --> 03:40:30,399
the really great triumphs in human
 

10605
03:40:30,399 --> 03:40:32,030
the really great triumphs in human
history you think about all the really

10606
03:40:32,030 --> 03:40:32,040
history you think about all the really
 

10607
03:40:32,040 --> 03:40:33,590
history you think about all the really
horrific

10608
03:40:33,590 --> 03:40:33,600
horrific
 

10609
03:40:33,600 --> 03:40:36,030
horrific
tragedies um you know you think about

10610
03:40:36,030 --> 03:40:36,040
tragedies um you know you think about
 

10611
03:40:36,040 --> 03:40:39,309
tragedies um you know you think about
the Holocaust you think about um

10612
03:40:39,309 --> 03:40:39,319
the Holocaust you think about um
 

10613
03:40:39,319 --> 03:40:42,750
the Holocaust you think about um
any prison full of human

10614
03:40:42,750 --> 03:40:42,760
any prison full of human
 

10615
03:40:42,760 --> 03:40:47,309
any prison full of human
stories uh and all of those

10616
03:40:47,309 --> 03:40:47,319
stories uh and all of those
 

10617
03:40:47,319 --> 03:40:49,710
stories uh and all of those
problems boil down to

10618
03:40:49,710 --> 03:40:49,720
problems boil down to
 

10619
03:40:49,720 --> 03:40:51,590
problems boil down to
neurochemistry so if you get a little

10620
03:40:51,590 --> 03:40:51,600
neurochemistry so if you get a little
 

10621
03:40:51,600 --> 03:40:53,189
neurochemistry so if you get a little
bit of control over

10622
03:40:53,189 --> 03:40:53,199
bit of control over
 

10623
03:40:53,199 --> 03:40:56,590
bit of control over
that you provide people the option to do

10624
03:40:56,590 --> 03:40:56,600
that you provide people the option to do
 

10625
03:40:56,600 --> 03:40:59,189
that you provide people the option to do
better in the way I read history the way

10626
03:40:59,189 --> 03:40:59,199
better in the way I read history the way
 

10627
03:40:59,199 --> 03:41:00,990
better in the way I read history the way
people have dealt with having better

10628
03:41:00,990 --> 03:41:01,000
people have dealt with having better
 

10629
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:04,229
people have dealt with having better
tools is that they most often in the end

10630
03:41:04,229 --> 03:41:04,239
tools is that they most often in the end
 

10631
03:41:04,239 --> 03:41:07,590
tools is that they most often in the end
do better uh with huge

10632
03:41:07,590 --> 03:41:07,600
do better uh with huge
 

10633
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:10,429
do better uh with huge
asterisks but I think it's a an

10634
03:41:10,429 --> 03:41:10,439
asterisks but I think it's a an
 

10635
03:41:10,439 --> 03:41:13,229
asterisks but I think it's a an
interesting a worthy a noble pursuit to

10636
03:41:13,229 --> 03:41:13,239
interesting a worthy a noble pursuit to
 

10637
03:41:13,239 --> 03:41:16,030
interesting a worthy a noble pursuit to
give people more options more tools

10638
03:41:16,030 --> 03:41:16,040
give people more options more tools
 

10639
03:41:16,040 --> 03:41:17,510
give people more options more tools
yeah that's a fascinating way to look at

10640
03:41:17,510 --> 03:41:17,520
yeah that's a fascinating way to look at
 

10641
03:41:17,520 --> 03:41:20,269
yeah that's a fascinating way to look at
human history you just imagine all these

10642
03:41:20,269 --> 03:41:20,279
human history you just imagine all these
 

10643
03:41:20,279 --> 03:41:22,910
human history you just imagine all these
neurobiological mechanisms Stalin Hitler

10644
03:41:22,910 --> 03:41:22,920
neurobiological mechanisms Stalin Hitler
 

10645
03:41:22,920 --> 03:41:26,070
neurobiological mechanisms Stalin Hitler
all of these jenus Khan all of them just

10646
03:41:26,070 --> 03:41:26,080
all of these jenus Khan all of them just
 

10647
03:41:26,080 --> 03:41:30,070
all of these jenus Khan all of them just
had like a a brain it just a bunch of

10648
03:41:30,070 --> 03:41:30,080
had like a a brain it just a bunch of
 

10649
03:41:30,080 --> 03:41:32,070
had like a a brain it just a bunch of
neurons you know like few tons of

10650
03:41:32,070 --> 03:41:32,080
neurons you know like few tons of
 

10651
03:41:32,080 --> 03:41:33,149
neurons you know like few tons of
billions of

10652
03:41:33,149 --> 03:41:33,159
billions of
 

10653
03:41:33,159 --> 03:41:35,469
billions of
neurons uh gaining a bunch of

10654
03:41:35,469 --> 03:41:35,479
neurons uh gaining a bunch of
 

10655
03:41:35,479 --> 03:41:37,030
neurons uh gaining a bunch of
information over a period of time they

10656
03:41:37,030 --> 03:41:37,040
information over a period of time they
 

10657
03:41:37,040 --> 03:41:39,030
information over a period of time they
have set a module that does language and

10658
03:41:39,030 --> 03:41:39,040
have set a module that does language and
 

10659
03:41:39,040 --> 03:41:42,030
have set a module that does language and
memory and all that and from there in in

10660
03:41:42,030 --> 03:41:42,040
memory and all that and from there in in
 

10661
03:41:42,040 --> 03:41:43,429
memory and all that and from there in in
in the case of those people they're able

10662
03:41:43,429 --> 03:41:43,439
in the case of those people they're able
 

10663
03:41:43,439 --> 03:41:46,429
in the case of those people they're able
to murder millions of people yeah and

10664
03:41:46,429 --> 03:41:46,439
to murder millions of people yeah and
 

10665
03:41:46,439 --> 03:41:48,510
to murder millions of people yeah and
all that coming

10666
03:41:48,510 --> 03:41:48,520
all that coming
 

10667
03:41:48,520 --> 03:41:51,590
all that coming
from uh there's not some glorified

10668
03:41:51,590 --> 03:41:51,600
from uh there's not some glorified
 

10669
03:41:51,600 --> 03:41:56,030
from uh there's not some glorified
notion of a a dictator of this enormous

10670
03:41:56,030 --> 03:41:56,040
notion of a a dictator of this enormous
 

10671
03:41:56,040 --> 03:41:57,950
notion of a a dictator of this enormous
mind or something like this it's just

10672
03:41:57,950 --> 03:41:57,960
mind or something like this it's just
 

10673
03:41:57,960 --> 03:42:01,309
mind or something like this it's just
it's just the brain yeah yeah I mean a

10674
03:42:01,309 --> 03:42:01,319
it's just the brain yeah yeah I mean a
 

10675
03:42:01,319 --> 03:42:04,429
it's just the brain yeah yeah I mean a
lot of that has to do with how well

10676
03:42:04,429 --> 03:42:04,439
lot of that has to do with how well
 

10677
03:42:04,439 --> 03:42:06,830
lot of that has to do with how well
people like that can organize those

10678
03:42:06,830 --> 03:42:06,840
people like that can organize those
 

10679
03:42:06,840 --> 03:42:11,189
people like that can organize those
around them other brains yeah and so I

10680
03:42:11,189 --> 03:42:11,199
around them other brains yeah and so I
 

10681
03:42:11,199 --> 03:42:13,149
around them other brains yeah and so I
always find it interesting to look to

10682
03:42:13,149 --> 03:42:13,159
always find it interesting to look to
 

10683
03:42:13,159 --> 03:42:15,189
always find it interesting to look to
primatology you know look to our closest

10684
03:42:15,189 --> 03:42:15,199
primatology you know look to our closest
 

10685
03:42:15,199 --> 03:42:18,910
primatology you know look to our closest
non-human relatives uh for Clues as to

10686
03:42:18,910 --> 03:42:18,920
non-human relatives uh for Clues as to
 

10687
03:42:18,920 --> 03:42:20,990
non-human relatives uh for Clues as to
how humans are going to behave and and

10688
03:42:20,990 --> 03:42:21,000
how humans are going to behave and and
 

10689
03:42:21,000 --> 03:42:24,469
how humans are going to behave and and
what particular humans are able to

10690
03:42:24,469 --> 03:42:24,479
what particular humans are able to
 

10691
03:42:24,479 --> 03:42:26,590
what particular humans are able to
achieve and so you look

10692
03:42:26,590 --> 03:42:26,600
achieve and so you look
 

10693
03:42:26,600 --> 03:42:30,469
achieve and so you look
at um chimpanzees and bonobos and you

10694
03:42:30,469 --> 03:42:30,479
at um chimpanzees and bonobos and you
 

10695
03:42:30,479 --> 03:42:32,710
at um chimpanzees and bonobos and you
know they're similar but different in

10696
03:42:32,710 --> 03:42:32,720
know they're similar but different in
 

10697
03:42:32,720 --> 03:42:35,110
know they're similar but different in
their social structures

10698
03:42:35,110 --> 03:42:35,120
their social structures
 

10699
03:42:35,120 --> 03:42:37,790
their social structures
particularly and I went to Emory in

10700
03:42:37,790 --> 03:42:37,800
particularly and I went to Emory in
 

10701
03:42:37,800 --> 03:42:40,469
particularly and I went to Emory in
Atlanta and studied under uh Fran Dall

10702
03:42:40,469 --> 03:42:40,479
Atlanta and studied under uh Fran Dall
 

10703
03:42:40,479 --> 03:42:42,349
Atlanta and studied under uh Fran Dall
the great Fran Dall who was kind of the

10704
03:42:42,349 --> 03:42:42,359
the great Fran Dall who was kind of the
 

10705
03:42:42,359 --> 03:42:43,229
the great Fran Dall who was kind of the
leading

10706
03:42:43,229 --> 03:42:43,239
leading
 

10707
03:42:43,239 --> 03:42:46,429
leading
primatologist uh who recently died

10708
03:42:46,429 --> 03:42:46,439
primatologist uh who recently died
 

10709
03:42:46,439 --> 03:42:50,550
primatologist uh who recently died
and his work in at looking at chimps

10710
03:42:50,550 --> 03:42:50,560
and his work in at looking at chimps
 

10711
03:42:50,560 --> 03:42:53,429
and his work in at looking at chimps
through the lens of you know how you

10712
03:42:53,429 --> 03:42:53,439
through the lens of you know how you
 

10713
03:42:53,439 --> 03:42:55,429
through the lens of you know how you
would watch an episode of Friends and

10714
03:42:55,429 --> 03:42:55,439
would watch an episode of Friends and
 

10715
03:42:55,439 --> 03:42:57,189
would watch an episode of Friends and
understand the motivations of the

10716
03:42:57,189 --> 03:42:57,199
understand the motivations of the
 

10717
03:42:57,199 --> 03:42:58,630
understand the motivations of the
characters interacting with each other

10718
03:42:58,630 --> 03:42:58,640
characters interacting with each other
 

10719
03:42:58,640 --> 03:43:00,710
characters interacting with each other
he would look at a chimp colony and

10720
03:43:00,710 --> 03:43:00,720
he would look at a chimp colony and
 

10721
03:43:00,720 --> 03:43:03,510
he would look at a chimp colony and
basically apply that lens I'm massively

10722
03:43:03,510 --> 03:43:03,520
basically apply that lens I'm massively
 

10723
03:43:03,520 --> 03:43:05,990
basically apply that lens I'm massively
oversimplifying it if you do that

10724
03:43:05,990 --> 03:43:06,000
oversimplifying it if you do that
 

10725
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:09,469
oversimplifying it if you do that
instead of just saying you know subject

10726
03:43:09,469 --> 03:43:09,479
instead of just saying you know subject
 

10727
03:43:09,479 --> 03:43:11,990
instead of just saying you know subject

03:43:27,199 --> 03:43:29,790
understandable goals and drives what
they want out of life and primarily it's

10742
03:43:29,790 --> 03:43:29,800
they want out of life and primarily it's
 

10743
03:43:29,800 --> 03:43:31,590
they want out of life and primarily it's
you know the things we want out of life

10744
03:43:31,590 --> 03:43:31,600
you know the things we want out of life
 

10745
03:43:31,600 --> 03:43:33,670
you know the things we want out of life
food sex

10746
03:43:33,670 --> 03:43:33,680
food sex
 

10747
03:43:33,680 --> 03:43:36,469
food sex
companionship um

10748
03:43:36,469 --> 03:43:36,479
companionship um
 

10749
03:43:36,479 --> 03:43:39,750
companionship um
Power uh you can understand chimp and

10750
03:43:39,750 --> 03:43:39,760
Power uh you can understand chimp and
 

10751
03:43:39,760 --> 03:43:43,429
Power uh you can understand chimp and
Boba behavior in those same lights uh

10752
03:43:43,429 --> 03:43:43,439
Boba behavior in those same lights uh
 

10753
03:43:43,439 --> 03:43:47,830
Boba behavior in those same lights uh
much more easily and I think doing so

10754
03:43:47,830 --> 03:43:47,840
much more easily and I think doing so
 

10755
03:43:47,840 --> 03:43:50,590
much more easily and I think doing so
gives you the tools you need to reduce

10756
03:43:50,590 --> 03:43:50,600
gives you the tools you need to reduce
 

10757
03:43:50,600 --> 03:43:53,389
gives you the tools you need to reduce
human behavior from the kind of false

10758
03:43:53,389 --> 03:43:53,399
human behavior from the kind of false
 

10759
03:43:53,399 --> 03:43:56,110
human behavior from the kind of false
complexity that we layer on to it with

10760
03:43:56,110 --> 03:43:56,120
complexity that we layer on to it with
 

10761
03:43:56,120 --> 03:43:59,269
complexity that we layer on to it with
language and look at it in terms of oh

10762
03:43:59,269 --> 03:43:59,279
language and look at it in terms of oh
 

10763
03:43:59,279 --> 03:44:01,070
language and look at it in terms of oh
well these humans are looking for

10764
03:44:01,070 --> 03:44:01,080
well these humans are looking for
 

10765
03:44:01,080 --> 03:44:03,630
well these humans are looking for
companionship sex food

10766
03:44:03,630 --> 03:44:03,640
companionship sex food
 

10767
03:44:03,640 --> 03:44:07,630
companionship sex food
power um and I think that that's a

10768
03:44:07,630 --> 03:44:07,640
power um and I think that that's a
 

10769
03:44:07,640 --> 03:44:09,349
power um and I think that that's a
pretty powerful tool to have in

10770
03:44:09,349 --> 03:44:09,359
pretty powerful tool to have in
 

10771
03:44:09,359 --> 03:44:11,790
pretty powerful tool to have in
understanding human behavior and I just

10772
03:44:11,790 --> 03:44:11,800
understanding human behavior and I just
 

10773
03:44:11,800 --> 03:44:13,590
understanding human behavior and I just
uh went to the Amazon jungle for a few

10774
03:44:13,590 --> 03:44:13,600
uh went to the Amazon jungle for a few
 

10775
03:44:13,600 --> 03:44:16,550
uh went to the Amazon jungle for a few
weeks and you it's a very visceral

10776
03:44:16,550 --> 03:44:16,560
weeks and you it's a very visceral
 

10777
03:44:16,560 --> 03:44:19,830
weeks and you it's a very visceral
reminder that a lot of life on Earth is

10778
03:44:19,830 --> 03:44:19,840
reminder that a lot of life on Earth is
 

10779
03:44:19,840 --> 03:44:21,750
reminder that a lot of life on Earth is
just trying to get laid yeah they're all

10780
03:44:21,750 --> 03:44:21,760
just trying to get laid yeah they're all
 

10781
03:44:21,760 --> 03:44:24,110
just trying to get laid yeah they're all
screaming at each other like I saw a lot

10782
03:44:24,110 --> 03:44:24,120
screaming at each other like I saw a lot
 

10783
03:44:24,120 --> 03:44:26,149
screaming at each other like I saw a lot
of monkeys and they're just trying to

10784
03:44:26,149 --> 03:44:26,159
of monkeys and they're just trying to
 

10785
03:44:26,159 --> 03:44:28,070
of monkeys and they're just trying to
impress each other or maybe there's a

10786
03:44:28,070 --> 03:44:28,080
impress each other or maybe there's a
 

10787
03:44:28,080 --> 03:44:30,750
impress each other or maybe there's a
battle for power but a lot of the battle

10788
03:44:30,750 --> 03:44:30,760
battle for power but a lot of the battle
 

10789
03:44:30,760 --> 03:44:32,269
battle for power but a lot of the battle
for power has to do with them getting

10790
03:44:32,269 --> 03:44:32,279
for power has to do with them getting
 

10791
03:44:32,279 --> 03:44:35,510
for power has to do with them getting
laid right reading rights often go with

10792
03:44:35,510 --> 03:44:35,520
laid right reading rights often go with
 

10793
03:44:35,520 --> 03:44:38,070
laid right reading rights often go with
Alpha status and so if you can get a

10794
03:44:38,070 --> 03:44:38,080
Alpha status and so if you can get a
 

10795
03:44:38,080 --> 03:44:40,149
Alpha status and so if you can get a
piece of that then you're going to do

10796
03:44:40,149 --> 03:44:40,159
piece of that then you're going to do
 

10797
03:44:40,159 --> 03:44:41,630
piece of that then you're going to do
okay and would like to think that we're

10798
03:44:41,630 --> 03:44:41,640
okay and would like to think that we're
 

10799
03:44:41,640 --> 03:44:44,070
okay and would like to think that we're
somehow fundamentally different but

10800
03:44:44,070 --> 03:44:44,080
somehow fundamentally different but
 

10801
03:44:44,080 --> 03:44:45,349
somehow fundamentally different but
especially when it talk comes to

10802
03:44:45,349 --> 03:44:45,359
especially when it talk comes to
 

10803
03:44:45,359 --> 03:44:48,070
especially when it talk comes to
primates where really AR you know we can

10804
03:44:48,070 --> 03:44:48,080
primates where really AR you know we can
 

10805
03:44:48,080 --> 03:44:50,870
primates where really AR you know we can
use fancer poetic language but uh maybe

10806
03:44:50,870 --> 03:44:50,880
use fancer poetic language but uh maybe
 

10807
03:44:50,880 --> 03:44:53,990
use fancer poetic language but uh maybe
some of the underlying drives that

10808
03:44:53,990 --> 03:44:54,000
some of the underlying drives that
 

10809
03:44:54,000 --> 03:44:58,389
some of the underlying drives that
motivate us are um similar yeah I think

10810
03:44:58,389 --> 03:44:58,399
motivate us are um similar yeah I think
 

10811
03:44:58,399 --> 03:45:00,110
motivate us are um similar yeah I think
that's true and all that is coming from

10812
03:45:00,110 --> 03:45:00,120
that's true and all that is coming from
 

10813
03:45:00,120 --> 03:45:02,990
that's true and all that is coming from
this the brain yeah uh so when did you

10814
03:45:02,990 --> 03:45:03,000
this the brain yeah uh so when did you
 

10815
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:05,189
this the brain yeah uh so when did you
first start studying the the brain as

10816
03:45:05,189 --> 03:45:05,199
first start studying the the brain as
 

10817
03:45:05,199 --> 03:45:07,389
first start studying the the brain as
like as a biological mechanism basically

10818
03:45:07,389 --> 03:45:07,399
like as a biological mechanism basically
 

10819
03:45:07,399 --> 03:45:09,990
like as a biological mechanism basically
the moment I got to college I started

10820
03:45:09,990 --> 03:45:10,000
the moment I got to college I started
 

10821
03:45:10,000 --> 03:45:12,189
the moment I got to college I started
looking around for labs that I could uh

10822
03:45:12,189 --> 03:45:12,199
looking around for labs that I could uh
 

10823
03:45:12,199 --> 03:45:15,469
looking around for labs that I could uh
do Neuroscience work in uh I originally

10824
03:45:15,469 --> 03:45:15,479
do Neuroscience work in uh I originally
 

10825
03:45:15,479 --> 03:45:18,910
do Neuroscience work in uh I originally
approached that from the angle of uh

10826
03:45:18,910 --> 03:45:18,920
approached that from the angle of uh
 

10827
03:45:18,920 --> 03:45:20,309
approached that from the angle of uh
looking at interactions between the

10828
03:45:20,309 --> 03:45:20,319
looking at interactions between the
 

10829
03:45:20,319 --> 03:45:22,269
looking at interactions between the
brain and the immune system which isn't

10830
03:45:22,269 --> 03:45:22,279
brain and the immune system which isn't
 

10831
03:45:22,279 --> 03:45:25,429
brain and the immune system which isn't
the most obvious place to start but um I

10832
03:45:25,429 --> 03:45:25,439
the most obvious place to start but um I
 

10833
03:45:25,439 --> 03:45:27,830
the most obvious place to start but um I
had this idea at the time

10834
03:45:27,830 --> 03:45:27,840
had this idea at the time
 

10835
03:45:27,840 --> 03:45:32,550
had this idea at the time
that the contents of your thoughts would

10836
03:45:32,550 --> 03:45:32,560
that the contents of your thoughts would
 

10837
03:45:32,560 --> 03:45:34,670
that the contents of your thoughts would
have an impact a direct impact maybe a

10838
03:45:34,670 --> 03:45:34,680
have an impact a direct impact maybe a
 

10839
03:45:34,680 --> 03:45:38,670
have an impact a direct impact maybe a
powerful one on uh

10840
03:45:38,670 --> 03:45:38,680
powerful one on uh
 

10841
03:45:38,680 --> 03:45:41,269
powerful one on uh
non-conscious systems in your body the

10842
03:45:41,269 --> 03:45:41,279
non-conscious systems in your body the
 

10843
03:45:41,279 --> 03:45:43,590
non-conscious systems in your body the
systems we think of as you know

10844
03:45:43,590 --> 03:45:43,600
systems we think of as you know
 

10845
03:45:43,600 --> 03:45:46,790
systems we think of as you know
homeostatic autom IC mechanisms like

10846
03:45:46,790 --> 03:45:46,800
homeostatic autom IC mechanisms like
 

10847
03:45:46,800 --> 03:45:49,990
homeostatic autom IC mechanisms like
fighting off a virus like repairing a

10848
03:45:49,990 --> 03:45:50,000
fighting off a virus like repairing a
 

10849
03:45:50,000 --> 03:45:53,910
fighting off a virus like repairing a
wound um and sure enough there are big

10850
03:45:53,910 --> 03:45:53,920
wound um and sure enough there are big
 

10851
03:45:53,920 --> 03:45:56,670
wound um and sure enough there are big
crossovers between the two I mean it

10852
03:45:56,670 --> 03:45:56,680
crossovers between the two I mean it
 

10853
03:45:56,680 --> 03:46:00,670
crossovers between the two I mean it
gets to um kind of a key point that I

10854
03:46:00,670 --> 03:46:00,680
gets to um kind of a key point that I
 

10855
03:46:00,680 --> 03:46:02,349
gets to um kind of a key point that I
think goes underrecognized one of the

10856
03:46:02,349 --> 03:46:02,359
think goes underrecognized one of the
 

10857
03:46:02,359 --> 03:46:05,389
think goes underrecognized one of the
things people don't recognize or or

10858
03:46:05,389 --> 03:46:05,399
things people don't recognize or or
 

10859
03:46:05,399 --> 03:46:07,870
things people don't recognize or or
appreciate about the human brain uh

10860
03:46:07,870 --> 03:46:07,880
appreciate about the human brain uh
 

10861
03:46:07,880 --> 03:46:10,349
appreciate about the human brain uh
enough and that is that it basically

10862
03:46:10,349 --> 03:46:10,359
enough and that is that it basically
 

10863
03:46:10,359 --> 03:46:13,030
enough and that is that it basically
controls or has a huge role in almost

10864
03:46:13,030 --> 03:46:13,040
controls or has a huge role in almost
 

10865
03:46:13,040 --> 03:46:16,510
controls or has a huge role in almost
everything that your body does um like

10866
03:46:16,510 --> 03:46:16,520
everything that your body does um like
 

10867
03:46:16,520 --> 03:46:18,590
everything that your body does um like
you try to try to name an example of

10868
03:46:18,590 --> 03:46:18,600
you try to try to name an example of
 

10869
03:46:18,600 --> 03:46:20,950
you try to try to name an example of
something in your body that isn't

10870
03:46:20,950 --> 03:46:20,960
something in your body that isn't
 

10871
03:46:20,960 --> 03:46:22,670
something in your body that isn't
directly controlled or massively

10872
03:46:22,670 --> 03:46:22,680
directly controlled or massively
 

10873
03:46:22,680 --> 03:46:26,189
directly controlled or massively
influenced by the brain and uh it's

10874
03:46:26,189 --> 03:46:26,199
influenced by the brain and uh it's
 

10875
03:46:26,199 --> 03:46:28,110
influenced by the brain and uh it's
pretty hard I mean you might say like

10876
03:46:28,110 --> 03:46:28,120
pretty hard I mean you might say like
 

10877
03:46:28,120 --> 03:46:31,229
pretty hard I mean you might say like
bone healing or something but uh even

10878
03:46:31,229 --> 03:46:31,239
bone healing or something but uh even
 

10879
03:46:31,239 --> 03:46:33,389
bone healing or something but uh even
those systems the hypothalamus and

10880
03:46:33,389 --> 03:46:33,399
those systems the hypothalamus and
 

10881
03:46:33,399 --> 03:46:36,950
those systems the hypothalamus and
pituitary end up playing a role in

10882
03:46:36,950 --> 03:46:36,960
pituitary end up playing a role in
 

10883
03:46:36,960 --> 03:46:39,349
pituitary end up playing a role in
coordinating the endocrine system that

10884
03:46:39,349 --> 03:46:39,359
coordinating the endocrine system that
 

10885
03:46:39,359 --> 03:46:41,349
coordinating the endocrine system that
does have a direct influence on say the

10886
03:46:41,349 --> 03:46:41,359
does have a direct influence on say the
 

10887
03:46:41,359 --> 03:46:43,790
does have a direct influence on say the
calcium level in your blood that goes to

10888
03:46:43,790 --> 03:46:43,800
calcium level in your blood that goes to
 

10889
03:46:43,800 --> 03:46:46,189
calcium level in your blood that goes to
Bone healing so non-obvious connections

10890
03:46:46,189 --> 03:46:46,199
Bone healing so non-obvious connections
 

10891
03:46:46,199 --> 03:46:49,030
Bone healing so non-obvious connections
between those things uh implicate the

10892
03:46:49,030 --> 03:46:49,040
between those things uh implicate the
 

10893
03:46:49,040 --> 03:46:53,910
between those things uh implicate the
brain as really a potent prime mover in

10895
03:46:53,920 --> 03:46:56,910
brain as really a potent prime mover in
all of Health one of the things I

10896
03:46:56,910 --> 03:46:56,920
all of Health one of the things I
 

10897
03:46:56,920 --> 03:46:59,950
all of Health one of the things I
realized in the other direction too

10898
03:46:59,950 --> 03:46:59,960
realized in the other direction too
 

10899
03:46:59,960 --> 03:47:02,469
realized in the other direction too
how most of the systems in the body

10900
03:47:02,469 --> 03:47:02,479
how most of the systems in the body
 

10901
03:47:02,479 --> 03:47:04,349
how most of the systems in the body
integrated with the human brain like

10902
03:47:04,349 --> 03:47:04,359
integrated with the human brain like
 

10903
03:47:04,359 --> 03:47:05,830
integrated with the human brain like
they affect the brain also like the

10904
03:47:05,830 --> 03:47:05,840
they affect the brain also like the
 

10905
03:47:05,840 --> 03:47:08,910
they affect the brain also like the
immune system um I think there's just

10906
03:47:08,910 --> 03:47:08,920
immune system um I think there's just
 

10907
03:47:08,920 --> 03:47:10,910
immune system um I think there's just
you know people who study

10908
03:47:10,910 --> 03:47:10,920
you know people who study
 

10909
03:47:10,920 --> 03:47:14,590
you know people who study
Alzheimer's and uh those kinds of things

10910
03:47:14,590 --> 03:47:14,600
Alzheimer's and uh those kinds of things
 

10911
03:47:14,600 --> 03:47:16,269
Alzheimer's and uh those kinds of things
is it's just

10912
03:47:16,269 --> 03:47:16,279
is it's just
 

10913
03:47:16,279 --> 03:47:18,950
is it's just
surprising how much you can understand

10914
03:47:18,950 --> 03:47:18,960
surprising how much you can understand
 

10915
03:47:18,960 --> 03:47:21,110
surprising how much you can understand
of that from the immune system from the

10916
03:47:21,110 --> 03:47:21,120
of that from the immune system from the
 

10917
03:47:21,120 --> 03:47:23,030
of that from the immune system from the
other systems that don't obviously seem

10918
03:47:23,030 --> 03:47:23,040
other systems that don't obviously seem
 

10919
03:47:23,040 --> 03:47:26,070
other systems that don't obviously seem
to have to anything to do with sort of

10920
03:47:26,070 --> 03:47:26,080
to have to anything to do with sort of
 

10921
03:47:26,080 --> 03:47:27,790
to have to anything to do with sort of
the nervous system they all play

10922
03:47:27,790 --> 03:47:27,800
the nervous system they all play
 

10923
03:47:27,800 --> 03:47:29,750
the nervous system they all play
together yeah you could understand how

10924
03:47:29,750 --> 03:47:29,760
together yeah you could understand how
 

10925
03:47:29,760 --> 03:47:32,349
together yeah you could understand how
that would be driven by Evolution too

10926
03:47:32,349 --> 03:47:32,359
that would be driven by Evolution too
 

10927
03:47:32,359 --> 03:47:35,229
that would be driven by Evolution too
just in some simple examples if you get

10928
03:47:35,229 --> 03:47:35,239
just in some simple examples if you get
 

10929
03:47:35,239 --> 03:47:37,309
just in some simple examples if you get
sick if you get a communicable disease

10930
03:47:37,309 --> 03:47:37,319
sick if you get a communicable disease
 

10931
03:47:37,319 --> 03:47:38,469
sick if you get a communicable disease
you get the

10932
03:47:38,469 --> 03:47:38,479
you get the
 

10933
03:47:38,479 --> 03:47:40,149
you get the

10934
03:47:40,149 --> 03:47:40,159
flu
 

10935
03:47:40,159 --> 03:47:43,750
flu
uh it's pretty advantageous for your

10936
03:47:43,750 --> 03:47:43,760
uh it's pretty advantageous for your
 

10937
03:47:43,760 --> 03:47:47,189
uh it's pretty advantageous for your
immune system to tell your brain hey now

10938
03:47:47,189 --> 03:47:47,199
immune system to tell your brain hey now

tonight in fact maybe just cuddle up
 

10945
03:47:55,000 --> 03:47:56,710
tonight in fact maybe just cuddle up
somewhere warm under a blanket and just

03:47:56,710 --> 03:47:56,720
somewhere warm under a blanket and just
 

10947
03:47:56,720 --> 03:47:58,950
somewhere warm under a blanket and just
stay there for a day or two and sure

03:48:00,550 --> 03:48:00,560
enough that tends to be the behavior
 

10951
03:48:00,560 --> 03:48:02,710
enough that tends to be the behavior
that you see both in animals and and in

that you see both in animals and and in
 

10953
03:48:02,720 --> 03:48:06,030
that you see both in animals and and in
humans if you get sick elevated levels

10963
03:48:15,479 --> 03:48:19,070

surgery when did that step happen was a
 

10975
03:48:33,800 --> 03:48:35,469
surgery when did that step happen was a
leap you know it was sort of an

10976
03:48:35,469 --> 03:48:35,479
leap you know it was sort of an
 

10977

evolution of thought I wanted to study

10978
03:48:38,469 --> 03:48:38,479
evolution of thought I wanted to study
 

10979
03:48:38,479 --> 03:48:40,990
evolution of thought I wanted to study
the brain so I started studying the

10980
03:48:40,990 --> 03:48:41,000
the brain so I started studying the
 

10981
03:48:41,000 --> 03:48:43,469
the brain so I started studying the
brain uh in undergrad in this

10982
03:48:43,469 --> 03:48:43,479
brain uh in undergrad in this
 

10983
03:48:43,479 --> 03:48:46,229
brain uh in undergrad in this
neuroimmunology lab

10984
03:48:46,229 --> 03:48:46,239
neuroimmunology lab
 

10985
03:48:46,239 --> 03:48:51,149
neuroimmunology lab
uh I from there uh realized at some

10986
03:48:51,149 --> 03:48:51,159
uh I from there uh realized at some
 

10987
03:48:51,159 --> 03:48:53,630
uh I from there uh realized at some
point that I didn't want to just

10988
03:48:53,630 --> 03:48:53,640
point that I didn't want to just
 

10989
03:48:53,640 --> 03:48:56,550
point that I didn't want to just
generate knowledge I wanted to affect

10990
03:48:56,550 --> 03:48:56,560
generate knowledge I wanted to affect
 

10991
03:48:56,560 --> 03:48:59,309
generate knowledge I wanted to affect
real changes in the actual World in

10992
03:48:59,309 --> 03:48:59,319
real changes in the actual World in
 

10993
03:48:59,319 --> 03:49:02,670
real changes in the actual World in
actual people's lives and so after

10994
03:49:02,670 --> 03:49:02,680
actual people's lives and so after
 

10995
03:49:02,680 --> 03:49:04,229
actual people's lives and so after
having not really thought about going

10996
03:49:04,229 --> 03:49:04,239
having not really thought about going
 

10997
03:49:04,239 --> 03:49:07,149
having not really thought about going
into medical school I was on a track to

10998
03:49:07,149 --> 03:49:07,159
into medical school I was on a track to
 

10999
03:49:07,159 --> 03:49:10,189
into medical school I was on a track to
go into a PhD program I said

11000
03:49:10,189 --> 03:49:10,199
go into a PhD program I said
 

11001
03:49:10,199 --> 03:49:13,030
go into a PhD program I said
well I'd like I'd like that option I'd

11002
03:49:13,030 --> 03:49:13,040
well I'd like I'd like that option I'd
 

11003
03:49:13,040 --> 03:49:15,269
well I'd like I'd like that option I'd
like to actually potentially

11004
03:49:15,269 --> 03:49:15,279
like to actually potentially
 

11005
03:49:15,279 --> 03:49:20,269
like to actually potentially
help tangible people in front of me and

11006
03:49:20,269 --> 03:49:20,279
help tangible people in front of me and
 

11007
03:49:20,279 --> 03:49:22,389
help tangible people in front of me and
uh doing a little digging found that

11008
03:49:22,389 --> 03:49:22,399
uh doing a little digging found that
 

11009
03:49:22,399 --> 03:49:25,389
uh doing a little digging found that
there exists these MD PHD programs where

11010
03:49:25,389 --> 03:49:25,399
there exists these MD PHD programs where
 

11011
03:49:25,399 --> 03:49:27,990
there exists these MD PHD programs where
you can choose not to

you can choose not to
 

11013
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:31,710
you can choose not to
choose between them and do both and so

11014
03:49:31,710 --> 03:49:31,720
choose between them and do both and so
 

11015
03:49:31,720 --> 03:49:35,590
choose between them and do both and so
uh I went to USC for medical school and

11016
03:49:35,590 --> 03:49:35,600
uh I went to USC for medical school and
 

11017
03:49:35,600 --> 03:49:37,790
uh I went to USC for medical school and
had a joint PhD program with

had a joint PhD program with
 

11019
03:49:37,800 --> 03:49:42,510
had a joint PhD program with
Caltech um where I met actually chose

11020
03:49:42,510 --> 03:49:42,520
Caltech um where I met actually chose
 

11021
03:49:42,520 --> 03:49:45,229
Caltech um where I met actually chose
that program particularly because of

I would be a neurologist and study the
 

11043
03:50:09,800 --> 03:50:12,910
I would be a neurologist and study the

neurology uh predominantly and and

11050
03:50:22,910 --> 03:50:22,920
neurology uh predominantly and and
 

11051
03:50:22,920 --> 03:50:25,389
neurology uh predominantly and and
distressingly to me is is the practice

11052
03:50:25,389 --> 03:50:25,399
distressingly to me is is the practice
 

11053
03:50:25,399 --> 03:50:27,790
distressingly to me is is the practice
of diagnosing a thing and then saying

11054
03:50:27,790 --> 03:50:27,800
of diagnosing a thing and then saying
 

11055
03:50:27,800 --> 03:50:29,269
of diagnosing a thing and then saying
good luck with that there's not much we

11056
03:50:29,269 --> 03:50:29,279
good luck with that there's not much we
 

11057
03:50:29,279 --> 03:50:29,950
good luck with that there's not much we
can

11058
03:50:29,950 --> 03:50:29,960
can
 

11059
03:50:29,960 --> 03:50:34,750
can
do um and neurosurgery very differently

11060
03:50:34,750 --> 03:50:34,760
do um and neurosurgery very differently
 

11061
03:50:34,760 --> 03:50:39,149
do um and neurosurgery very differently
uh is a it's a powerful lever on taking

11062
03:50:39,149 --> 03:50:39,159
uh is a it's a powerful lever on taking
 

11063
03:50:39,159 --> 03:50:40,429
uh is a it's a powerful lever on taking
people that are headed in a bad

11064
03:50:40,429 --> 03:50:40,439
people that are headed in a bad
 

11065
03:50:40,439 --> 03:50:43,110
people that are headed in a bad
Direction and changing their course uh

11066
03:50:43,110 --> 03:50:43,120
Direction and changing their course uh
 

11067
03:50:43,120 --> 03:50:46,229
Direction and changing their course uh
in the sense of brain tumors that are

11068
03:50:46,229 --> 03:50:46,239
in the sense of brain tumors that are
 

11069
03:50:46,239 --> 03:50:48,990
in the sense of brain tumors that are
potentially treatable or curable with

11070
03:50:48,990 --> 03:50:49,000
potentially treatable or curable with
 

11071
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:52,070
potentially treatable or curable with
surgery um you know even aneurysms in

11072
03:50:52,070 --> 03:50:52,080
surgery um you know even aneurysms in
 

11073
03:50:52,080 --> 03:50:53,389
surgery um you know even aneurysms in
the brain blood vessels that are going

11074
03:50:53,389 --> 03:50:53,399
the brain blood vessels that are going
 

11075
03:50:53,399 --> 03:50:56,269
the brain blood vessels that are going
to rupture you can uh save lives really

11076
03:50:56,269 --> 03:50:56,279
to rupture you can uh save lives really
 

11077
03:50:56,279 --> 03:50:57,910
to rupture you can uh save lives really
is at the end of the day what What

11078
03:50:57,910 --> 03:50:57,920
is at the end of the day what What
 

11079
03:50:57,920 --> 03:51:00,229
is at the end of the day what What
mattered to me and

11080
03:51:00,229 --> 03:51:00,239
mattered to me and
 

11081
03:51:00,239 --> 03:51:04,349
mattered to me and
so uh I was at USC as I mentioned that

11082
03:51:04,349 --> 03:51:04,359
so uh I was at USC as I mentioned that
 

11083
03:51:04,359 --> 03:51:06,510
so uh I was at USC as I mentioned that
happens to be one of the great

11084
03:51:06,510 --> 03:51:06,520
happens to be one of the great
 

11085
03:51:06,520 --> 03:51:10,429
happens to be one of the great
neurosurgery programs and so I met these

11086
03:51:10,429 --> 03:51:10,439
neurosurgery programs and so I met these
 

11087
03:51:10,439 --> 03:51:15,830
neurosurgery programs and so I met these
truly epic uh neurosurgeons Al kesi and

11088
03:51:15,830 --> 03:51:15,840
truly epic uh neurosurgeons Al kesi and
 

11089
03:51:15,840 --> 03:51:18,110
truly epic uh neurosurgeons Al kesi and
and M A puzzo and Steve ginata and Marty

11090
03:51:18,110 --> 03:51:18,120
and M A puzzo and Steve ginata and Marty
 

11091
03:51:18,120 --> 03:51:20,189
and M A puzzo and Steve ginata and Marty
Weiss these these sort of Epic people

11092
03:51:20,189 --> 03:51:20,199
Weiss these these sort of Epic people
 

11093
03:51:20,199 --> 03:51:22,149
Weiss these these sort of Epic people
that were just human beings in front of

11094
03:51:22,149 --> 03:51:22,159
that were just human beings in front of
 

11095
03:51:22,159 --> 03:51:25,269
that were just human beings in front of
me and so it kind of changed my thinking

11096
03:51:25,269 --> 03:51:25,279
me and so it kind of changed my thinking
 

11097
03:51:25,279 --> 03:51:29,469
me and so it kind of changed my thinking
from neurosurgeons are distant gods that

11098
03:51:29,469 --> 03:51:29,479
from neurosurgeons are distant gods that
 

11099
03:51:29,479 --> 03:51:31,149
from neurosurgeons are distant gods that
live on another planet and occasionally

11100
03:51:31,149 --> 03:51:31,159
live on another planet and occasionally
 

11101
03:51:31,159 --> 03:51:33,950
live on another planet and occasionally
come and visit us to these are humans

11102
03:51:33,950 --> 03:51:33,960
come and visit us to these are humans
 

11103
03:51:33,960 --> 03:51:37,429
come and visit us to these are humans
that have problems and are people and uh

11104
03:51:37,429 --> 03:51:37,439
that have problems and are people and uh
 

11105
03:51:37,439 --> 03:51:39,030
that have problems and are people and uh
there's nothing fundamentally preventing

11106
03:51:39,030 --> 03:51:39,040
there's nothing fundamentally preventing
 

11107
03:51:39,040 --> 03:51:41,910
there's nothing fundamentally preventing
me from being one of them uh and

11108
03:51:41,910 --> 03:51:41,920
me from being one of them uh and
 

11109
03:51:41,920 --> 03:51:44,830
me from being one of them uh and
so um at the last minute in medical

11110
03:51:44,830 --> 03:51:44,840
so um at the last minute in medical
 

11111
03:51:44,840 --> 03:51:47,910
so um at the last minute in medical
school I changed gears from going into a

11112
03:51:47,910 --> 03:51:47,920
school I changed gears from going into a
 

11113
03:51:47,920 --> 03:51:49,429
school I changed gears from going into a
different specialty and and switched

11114
03:51:49,429 --> 03:51:49,439
different specialty and and switched
 

11115
03:51:49,439 --> 03:51:50,349
different specialty and and switched
into

11116
03:51:50,349 --> 03:51:50,359
into
 

11117
03:51:50,359 --> 03:51:52,870
into
neurosurgery uh which cost me a year I

11118
03:51:52,870 --> 03:51:52,880
neurosurgery uh which cost me a year I
 

11119
03:51:52,880 --> 03:51:55,349
neurosurgery uh which cost me a year I
had to do another year of research uh

11120
03:51:55,349 --> 03:51:55,359
had to do another year of research uh
 

11121
03:51:55,359 --> 03:51:57,269
had to do another year of research uh
because I was so far along in the

11122
03:51:57,269 --> 03:51:57,279
because I was so far along in the
 

11123
03:51:57,279 --> 03:52:00,750
because I was so far along in the
process uh that um to switch into

11124
03:52:00,750 --> 03:52:00,760
process uh that um to switch into
 

11125
03:52:00,760 --> 03:52:02,309
process uh that um to switch into
neurosurgery the deadlines had already

11126
03:52:02,309 --> 03:52:02,319
neurosurgery the deadlines had already
 

11127
03:52:02,319 --> 03:52:03,790
neurosurgery the deadlines had already
passed so

11128
03:52:03,790 --> 03:52:03,800
passed so
 

11129
03:52:03,800 --> 03:52:07,389
passed so
was a a decision that cost time but

11130
03:52:07,389 --> 03:52:07,399
was a a decision that cost time but
 

11131
03:52:07,399 --> 03:52:09,590
was a a decision that cost time but
absolutely worth it what was the hardest

11132
03:52:09,590 --> 03:52:09,600
absolutely worth it what was the hardest
 

11133
03:52:09,600 --> 03:52:11,309
absolutely worth it what was the hardest
part of the training on the on the

11134
03:52:11,309 --> 03:52:11,319
part of the training on the on the
 

11135
03:52:11,319 --> 03:52:13,269
part of the training on the on the
neurosurgeon

11136
03:52:13,269 --> 03:52:13,279
neurosurgeon
 

11137
03:52:13,279 --> 03:52:15,910
neurosurgeon
track yeah

11138
03:52:15,910 --> 03:52:15,920
track yeah
 

11139
03:52:15,920 --> 03:52:17,710
track yeah
two things I think that you know

11140
03:52:17,710 --> 03:52:17,720
two things I think that you know
 

11141
03:52:17,720 --> 03:52:20,189
two things I think that you know
residency in neurosurgery is sort of a

11142
03:52:20,189 --> 03:52:20,199
residency in neurosurgery is sort of a
 

11143
03:52:20,199 --> 03:52:22,710
residency in neurosurgery is sort of a
competition of pain of like how much

11144
03:52:22,710 --> 03:52:22,720
competition of pain of like how much
 

11145
03:52:22,720 --> 03:52:26,309
competition of pain of like how much
pain can you eat and smile yeah uh and

11146
03:52:26,309 --> 03:52:26,319
pain can you eat and smile yeah uh and
 

11147
03:52:26,319 --> 03:52:27,510
pain can you eat and smile yeah uh and
so

11148
03:52:27,510 --> 03:52:27,520
so
 

11149
03:52:27,520 --> 03:52:31,070
so
there's workout restrictions that uh are

11150
03:52:31,070 --> 03:52:31,080
there's workout restrictions that uh are
 

11151
03:52:31,080 --> 03:52:32,030
there's workout restrictions that uh are
not

11152
03:52:32,030 --> 03:52:32,040
not
 

11153
03:52:32,040 --> 03:52:34,309
not
really they're viewed at I think

11154
03:52:34,309 --> 03:52:34,319
really they're viewed at I think
 

11155
03:52:34,319 --> 03:52:36,349
really they're viewed at I think
internally among the residents as

11156
03:52:36,349 --> 03:52:36,359
internally among the residents as
 

11157
03:52:36,359 --> 03:52:39,429
internally among the residents as
weakness and so most neurosurgery

11158
03:52:39,429 --> 03:52:39,439
weakness and so most neurosurgery
 

11159
03:52:39,439 --> 03:52:42,149
weakness and so most neurosurgery
residents try to work as hard as they

11160
03:52:42,149 --> 03:52:42,159
residents try to work as hard as they
 

11161
03:52:42,159 --> 03:52:44,910
residents try to work as hard as they
can and that I think NE necessarily

11162
03:52:44,910 --> 03:52:44,920
can and that I think NE necessarily
 

11163
03:52:44,920 --> 03:52:46,790
can and that I think NE necessarily
means working long hours and sometimes

11164
03:52:46,790 --> 03:52:46,800
means working long hours and sometimes
 

11165
03:52:46,800 --> 03:52:49,710
means working long hours and sometimes
over the work hour limits and you know

11166
03:52:49,710 --> 03:52:49,720
over the work hour limits and you know
 

11167
03:52:49,720 --> 03:52:51,950
over the work hour limits and you know
we care about being compliant with

11168
03:52:51,950 --> 03:52:51,960
we care about being compliant with
 

11169
03:52:51,960 --> 03:52:54,550
we care about being compliant with
whatever regulations are uh in front of

11170
03:52:54,550 --> 03:52:54,560
whatever regulations are uh in front of
 

11171
03:52:54,560 --> 03:52:56,309
whatever regulations are uh in front of
us but I think more important than that

11172
03:52:56,309 --> 03:52:56,319
us but I think more important than that
 

11173
03:52:56,319 --> 03:52:58,870
us but I think more important than that
people want to give all give their all

11174
03:52:58,870 --> 03:52:58,880
people want to give all give their all
 

11175
03:52:58,880 --> 03:53:00,630
people want to give all give their all
in becoming a better neurosurgeon

11176
03:53:00,630 --> 03:53:00,640
in becoming a better neurosurgeon
 

11177
03:53:00,640 --> 03:53:03,429
in becoming a better neurosurgeon
because the the stakes are so high and

11178
03:53:03,429 --> 03:53:03,439
because the the stakes are so high and
 

11179
03:53:03,439 --> 03:53:06,149
because the the stakes are so high and
so it's a real fight to get

11180
03:53:06,149 --> 03:53:06,159
so it's a real fight to get
 

11181
03:53:06,159 --> 03:53:09,550
so it's a real fight to get
residents uh to say go home at the end

11182
03:53:09,550 --> 03:53:09,560
residents uh to say go home at the end
 

11183
03:53:09,560 --> 03:53:11,750
residents uh to say go home at the end
of their shift and not stay and do more

11184
03:53:11,750 --> 03:53:11,760
of their shift and not stay and do more
 

11185
03:53:11,760 --> 03:53:13,670
of their shift and not stay and do more
surgery Are you seriously saying like

11186
03:53:13,670 --> 03:53:13,680
surgery Are you seriously saying like
 

11187
03:53:13,680 --> 03:53:15,830
surgery Are you seriously saying like
one of the hardest things is literally

11188
03:53:15,830 --> 03:53:15,840
one of the hardest things is literally
 

11189
03:53:15,840 --> 03:53:18,670
one of the hardest things is literally
like getting forcing them to get sleep

11190
03:53:18,670 --> 03:53:18,680
like getting forcing them to get sleep
 

11191
03:53:18,680 --> 03:53:20,590
like getting forcing them to get sleep
and rest and all this kind of stuff

11192
03:53:20,590 --> 03:53:20,600
and rest and all this kind of stuff
 

11193
03:53:20,600 --> 03:53:22,750
and rest and all this kind of stuff
historically that was the case I think I

11194
03:53:22,750 --> 03:53:22,760
historically that was the case I think I
 

11195
03:53:22,760 --> 03:53:25,349
historically that was the case I think I
think the Next Generation I think the

11196
03:53:25,349 --> 03:53:25,359
think the Next Generation I think the
 

11197
03:53:25,359 --> 03:53:28,910
think the Next Generation I think the
next generation is more uh compliant and

11198
03:53:28,910 --> 03:53:28,920
next generation is more uh compliant and
 

11199
03:53:28,920 --> 03:53:30,790
next generation is more uh compliant and
more self is what you mean all right I'm

11200
03:53:30,790 --> 03:53:30,800
more self is what you mean all right I'm
 

11201
03:53:30,800 --> 03:53:32,469
more self is what you mean all right I'm
just I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I

11202
03:53:32,469 --> 03:53:32,479
just I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I
 

11203
03:53:32,479 --> 03:53:35,070
just I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I
didn't say it now I'm making enemies no

11204
03:53:35,070 --> 03:53:35,080
didn't say it now I'm making enemies no
 

11205
03:53:35,080 --> 03:53:37,269
didn't say it now I'm making enemies no
okay I get it wow that's fascinating uh

11206
03:53:37,269 --> 03:53:37,279
okay I get it wow that's fascinating uh
 

11207
03:53:37,279 --> 03:53:39,710
okay I get it wow that's fascinating uh
so what was the second thing the

11208
03:53:39,710 --> 03:53:39,720
so what was the second thing the
 

11209
03:53:39,720 --> 03:53:41,750
so what was the second thing the
personalities and maybe the two are

11210
03:53:41,750 --> 03:53:41,760
personalities and maybe the two are
 

11211
03:53:41,760 --> 03:53:43,990
personalities and maybe the two are
connected but so is was it pretty

11212
03:53:43,990 --> 03:53:44,000
connected but so is was it pretty
 

11213
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:45,030
connected but so is was it pretty
competitive

11214
03:53:45,030 --> 03:53:45,040
competitive
 

11215
03:53:45,040 --> 03:53:48,750
competitive
it's competitive and it's also

11216
03:53:48,750 --> 03:53:48,760
it's competitive and it's also
 

11217
03:53:48,760 --> 03:53:51,189
it's competitive and it's also
um you know as we touched on earlier

11218
03:53:51,189 --> 03:53:51,199
um you know as we touched on earlier
 

11219
03:53:51,199 --> 03:53:55,070
um you know as we touched on earlier
primates like power and I think um

11220
03:53:55,070 --> 03:53:55,080
primates like power and I think um
 

11221
03:53:55,080 --> 03:53:58,469
primates like power and I think um
neurosurgery has long had this Aura

11222
03:53:58,469 --> 03:53:58,479
neurosurgery has long had this Aura
 

11223
03:53:58,479 --> 03:54:01,670
neurosurgery has long had this Aura
of um mystique and excellence and

11224
03:54:01,670 --> 03:54:01,680
of um mystique and excellence and
 

11225
03:54:01,680 --> 03:54:03,389
of um mystique and excellence and
whatever about it and so it's it's an

11226
03:54:03,389 --> 03:54:03,399
whatever about it and so it's it's an
 

11227
03:54:03,399 --> 03:54:05,990
whatever about it and so it's it's an
invitation I think for people that are

11228
03:54:05,990 --> 03:54:06,000
invitation I think for people that are
 

11229
03:54:06,000 --> 03:54:08,670
invitation I think for people that are
cloaked in that Authority you know board

11230
03:54:08,670 --> 03:54:08,680
cloaked in that Authority you know board
 

11231
03:54:08,680 --> 03:54:10,790
cloaked in that Authority you know board
certified neurosurgeon is basically a

11232
03:54:10,790 --> 03:54:10,800
certified neurosurgeon is basically a
 

11233
03:54:10,800 --> 03:54:13,149
certified neurosurgeon is basically a

fighting that tendency is not something

11242
03:54:23,630 --> 03:54:23,640
fighting that tendency is not something
 

11243
03:54:23,640 --> 03:54:26,830
fighting that tendency is not something
that most neurosurgeons do well humility

11244
03:54:26,830 --> 03:54:26,840
that most neurosurgeons do well humility
 

11245
03:54:26,840 --> 03:54:30,149
that most neurosurgeons do well humility
isn't the Forte yeah one of the so um I

11246
03:54:30,149 --> 03:54:30,159
isn't the Forte yeah one of the so um I
 

11247
03:54:30,159 --> 03:54:32,510
isn't the Forte yeah one of the so um I
have friends uh who know you and

whenever they speak about you that
 

11251
03:54:35,319 --> 03:54:38,349

your you're have the surprising quality
 

11253
03:54:38,359 --> 03:54:40,269
your you're have the surprising quality
for a neurosurgeon of

11254
03:54:40,269 --> 03:54:40,279
for a neurosurgeon of
 

11255
03:54:40,279 --> 03:54:42,189
for a neurosurgeon of
humility which I think IND DEC cases

11256
03:54:42,189 --> 03:54:42,199
humility which I think IND DEC cases
 

11257
03:54:42,199 --> 03:54:44,950
humility which I think IND DEC cases
that it's not it's not as common is

11258
03:54:44,950 --> 03:54:44,960
that it's not it's not as common is
 

11259
03:54:44,960 --> 03:54:46,550
that it's not it's not as common is

gigantic sort of heroic aspect to
 

11265
03:54:51,399 --> 03:54:53,429
gigantic sort of heroic aspect to
neurosurgery and I think it gets to

11266
03:54:53,429 --> 03:54:53,439
neurosurgery and I think it gets to
 

11267
03:54:53,439 --> 03:54:56,110

see through fallacy from Authority so

11278
03:55:13,910 --> 03:55:13,920
see through fallacy from Authority so
 

11279

you know 10 Rockets or something and he
 

11287
03:55:22,520 --> 03:55:23,870
you know 10 Rockets or something and he
says well you did it wrong and we can do

you listen to me on how to build cars

11294
03:55:30,710 --> 03:55:30,720
you listen to me on how to build cars
 

11295
03:55:30,720 --> 03:55:33,189
you listen to me on how to build cars
and he says

11296
03:55:33,189 --> 03:55:33,199
and he says
 

11297
03:55:33,199 --> 03:55:35,510
and he says
no and so you don't walk into a room

11298
03:55:35,510 --> 03:55:35,520
no and so you don't walk into a room
 

11299
03:55:35,520 --> 03:55:36,910
no and so you don't walk into a room
that he's in and say well I'm a

11300
03:55:36,910 --> 03:55:36,920
that he's in and say well I'm a
 

11301

that he's in and say well I'm a
neurosurgeon let me tell you how to do

11302
03:55:38,429 --> 03:55:38,439
neurosurgeon let me tell you how to do
 

11303
03:55:38,439 --> 03:55:42,229
neurosurgeon let me tell you how to do
it uh he's going to say well I'm a human

11304
03:55:42,229 --> 03:55:42,239
it uh he's going to say well I'm a human
 

11305
03:55:42,239 --> 03:55:44,510
it uh he's going to say well I'm a human
being that has a brain I can think from

11306
03:55:44,510 --> 03:55:44,520
being that has a brain I can think from
 

11307
03:55:44,520 --> 03:55:47,550
being that has a brain I can think from
principles myself thank you very much uh

11308
03:55:47,550 --> 03:55:47,560
principles myself thank you very much uh
 

11309
03:55:47,560 --> 03:55:48,870
principles myself thank you very much uh
and here's how I think it ought to be

11310
03:55:48,870 --> 03:55:48,880
and here's how I think it ought to be
 

11311
03:55:48,880 --> 03:55:51,630
and here's how I think it ought to be
done let's go try it and see who's right

11312
03:55:51,630 --> 03:55:51,640
done let's go try it and see who's right
 

11313
03:55:51,640 --> 03:55:53,990
done let's go try it and see who's right
uh and that's a you know proven I think

11314
03:55:53,990 --> 03:55:54,000
uh and that's a you know proven I think
 

11315
03:55:54,000 --> 03:55:55,950
uh and that's a you know proven I think
over and over in his case to be a very

11316
03:55:55,950 --> 03:55:55,960
over and over in his case to be a very
 

11317
03:55:55,960 --> 03:55:57,790
over and over in his case to be a very
powerful approach if we just take that

11318
03:55:57,790 --> 03:55:57,800
powerful approach if we just take that
 

11319
03:55:57,800 --> 03:56:00,389
powerful approach if we just take that
tangent there's a fascinating

11320
03:56:00,389 --> 03:56:00,399
tangent there's a fascinating
 

11321
03:56:00,399 --> 03:56:03,070
tangent there's a fascinating
interdisciplinary team at neur link that

11322
03:56:03,070 --> 03:56:03,080
interdisciplinary team at neur link that
 

11323
03:56:03,080 --> 03:56:07,469
interdisciplinary team at neur link that
you get to interact with um including

11324
03:56:07,469 --> 03:56:07,479
you get to interact with um including
 

11325
03:56:07,479 --> 03:56:10,429
you get to interact with um including
Elon what do you think is the secret to

11326
03:56:10,429 --> 03:56:10,439
Elon what do you think is the secret to
 

11327
03:56:10,439 --> 03:56:13,070
Elon what do you think is the secret to
a successful team or what have you

11328
03:56:13,070 --> 03:56:13,080
a successful team or what have you
 

11329
03:56:13,080 --> 03:56:14,630
a successful team or what have you
learned from just getting to observe

11330
03:56:14,630 --> 03:56:14,640
learned from just getting to observe
 

11331
03:56:14,640 --> 03:56:17,510
learned from just getting to observe
these folks yeah World experts in

11332
03:56:17,510 --> 03:56:17,520
these folks yeah World experts in
 

11333
03:56:17,520 --> 03:56:19,710
these folks yeah World experts in
different disciplines work

11334
03:56:19,710 --> 03:56:19,720
different disciplines work
 

11335
03:56:19,720 --> 03:56:22,990
different disciplines work
together yeah there there's a sweet spot

11336
03:56:22,990 --> 03:56:23,000
together yeah there there's a sweet spot
 

11337
03:56:23,000 --> 03:56:24,990
together yeah there there's a sweet spot
uh where

11338
03:56:24,990 --> 03:56:25,000
uh where
 

11339
03:56:25,000 --> 03:56:28,670
uh where
people disagree and forcefully speak

11340
03:56:28,670 --> 03:56:28,680
people disagree and forcefully speak
 

11341
03:56:28,680 --> 03:56:31,590
people disagree and forcefully speak
their mind and passionately defend their

11342
03:56:31,590 --> 03:56:31,600
their mind and passionately defend their
 

11343
03:56:31,600 --> 03:56:34,070
their mind and passionately defend their
position and yet are still able to

11344
03:56:34,070 --> 03:56:34,080
position and yet are still able to
 

11345
03:56:34,080 --> 03:56:38,070
position and yet are still able to
accept information from others and

11346
03:56:38,070 --> 03:56:38,080
accept information from others and
 

11347
03:56:38,080 --> 03:56:40,030
accept information from others and
change their ideas when they're wrong

11348
03:56:40,030 --> 03:56:40,040
change their ideas when they're wrong
 

11349
03:56:40,040 --> 03:56:44,510
change their ideas when they're wrong
and so I like the analogy of sort of

11350
03:56:44,510 --> 03:56:44,520
and so I like the analogy of sort of
 

11351
03:56:44,520 --> 03:56:46,950
and so I like the analogy of sort of
how you polish rocks you put hard things

11352
03:56:46,950 --> 03:56:46,960
how you polish rocks you put hard things
 

11353
03:56:46,960 --> 03:56:50,550
how you polish rocks you put hard things
in a in a hard container and spin it

11354
03:56:50,550 --> 03:56:50,560
in a in a hard container and spin it
 

11355
03:56:50,560 --> 03:56:52,910

their pursuit
 

11463
03:59:10,840 --> 03:59:15,149
their pursuit
of um excellent Neurosurgical technique

11464
03:59:15,149 --> 03:59:15,159
of um excellent Neurosurgical technique
 

11465
03:59:15,159 --> 03:59:18,389
of um excellent Neurosurgical technique
decade over decade and and I think we're

11466
03:59:18,389 --> 03:59:18,399
decade over decade and and I think we're
 

11467

contributions not only to surgical

11474
03:59:29,389 --> 03:59:29,399
contributions not only to surgical
 

11475
03:59:29,399 --> 03:59:31,590
contributions not only to surgical
technique but they built training

11476
03:59:31,590 --> 03:59:31,600
technique but they built training
 

11477
03:59:31,600 --> 03:59:33,189
technique but they built training
programs that

11478
03:59:33,189 --> 03:59:33,199
programs that
 

11479
03:59:33,199 --> 03:59:37,189
programs that
trained dozens or hundreds of amazing

11480
03:59:37,189 --> 03:59:37,199
trained dozens or hundreds of amazing
 

11481
03:59:37,199 --> 03:59:40,269
trained dozens or hundreds of amazing
neurosurgeons I was just lucky to kind

11482
03:59:40,269 --> 03:59:40,279
neurosurgeons I was just lucky to kind
 

11483
03:59:40,279 --> 03:59:43,710
neurosurgeons I was just lucky to kind
of be in their wake what's that like you

11484
03:59:43,710 --> 03:59:43,720
of be in their wake what's that like you
 

11485
03:59:43,720 --> 03:59:44,710
of be in their wake what's that like you
mentioned

11486
03:59:44,710 --> 03:59:44,720
mentioned
 

11487
03:59:44,720 --> 03:59:48,550
mentioned
mentioned doing a surgery where the

11488
03:59:48,550 --> 03:59:48,560
mentioned doing a surgery where the
 

11489
03:59:48,560 --> 03:59:51,189
mentioned doing a surgery where the
person is likely not to survive does

11490
03:59:51,189 --> 03:59:51,199
person is likely not to survive does
 

11491
03:59:51,199 --> 03:59:53,389
person is likely not to survive does
that wear on

11492
03:59:53,389 --> 03:59:53,399
that wear on
 

11493
03:59:53,399 --> 04:00:01,110
that wear on
you yeah

11494
04:00:01,110 --> 04:00:01,120

 

11495
04:00:01,120 --> 04:00:05,870

um you know it's especially

11496
04:00:05,870 --> 04:00:05,880

 

11497
04:00:05,880 --> 04:00:09,510

challenging um when

11498
04:00:09,510 --> 04:00:09,520
challenging um when
 

11499
04:00:09,520 --> 04:00:13,590
challenging um when
you with all respect to to our elders uh

11500
04:00:13,590 --> 04:00:13,600
you with all respect to to our elders uh
 

11501
04:00:13,600 --> 04:00:16,149
you with all respect to to our elders uh
it doesn't hit so much when you're

11502
04:00:16,149 --> 04:00:16,159
it doesn't hit so much when you're
 

11503
04:00:16,159 --> 04:00:17,590
it doesn't hit so much when you're
taking care of an

11504
04:00:17,590 --> 04:00:17,600
taking care of an
 

11505
04:00:17,600 --> 04:00:19,710
taking care of an
80-year-old

11506
04:00:19,710 --> 04:00:19,720
80-year-old
 

11507
04:00:19,720 --> 04:00:22,670
80-year-old
and something was going to get them

11508
04:00:22,670 --> 04:00:22,680
and something was going to get them
 

11509
04:00:22,680 --> 04:00:26,030
and something was going to get them
pretty soon anyway and so you lose a

11510
04:00:26,030 --> 04:00:26,040
pretty soon anyway and so you lose a
 

11511
04:00:26,040 --> 04:00:28,510
pretty soon anyway and so you lose a

11513
04:00:28,520 --> 04:00:30,950
patient like that and it it was part of
the natural course of what is expected

11514
04:00:30,950 --> 04:00:30,960
the natural course of what is expected
 

11515
04:00:30,960 --> 04:00:35,070
the natural course of what is expected
of them in the in the coming years

11563
04:01:33,960 --> 04:01:36,070
English neurosurgeon who said it best I
think he says every neurosurgeon carries

11564

with them a private graveyard and I I

11566
04:01:37,910 --> 04:01:37,920
with them a private graveyard and I I
 

11567
04:01:37,920 --> 04:01:41,309
with them a private graveyard and I I
definitely feel that

11568
04:01:41,309 --> 04:01:41,319
definitely feel that
 

11569
04:01:41,319 --> 04:01:45,830
definitely feel that
um especially with young parents uh that

11570
04:01:45,830 --> 04:01:45,840
um especially with young parents uh that
 

11571
04:01:45,840 --> 04:01:49,229
um especially with young parents uh that
that kills me uh they they had a lot

more to

11574
04:01:50,510 --> 04:01:50,520
more to
 

11575
04:01:50,520 --> 04:01:53,110
more to
give the the loss of those people

11576
04:01:53,110 --> 04:01:53,120
give the the loss of those people
 

11577

give the the loss of those people
specifically has a you know knock on

11578
04:01:56,550 --> 04:01:56,560
specifically has a you know knock on
 

11579
04:01:56,560 --> 04:01:59,309
specifically has a you know knock on
effect that's going to make the world

11580
04:01:59,309 --> 04:01:59,319
effect that's going to make the world
 

11581
04:01:59,319 --> 04:02:03,670
effect that's going to make the world
worse for people uh for a long time and

04:02:03,670 --> 04:02:03,680
worse for people uh for a long time and
 

11583
04:02:03,680 --> 04:02:06,309
worse for people uh for a long time and
it's just hard to feel powerless in the

11584
04:02:06,309 --> 04:02:06,319
it's just hard to feel powerless in the
 

11585
04:02:06,319 --> 04:02:07,950
it's just hard to feel powerless in the
face of

11586

face of
 

11587

face of
that you know and that's where I think

11588
04:02:11,870 --> 04:02:11,880
that you know and that's where I think
 

11589
04:02:11,880 --> 04:02:15,710
that you know and that's where I think
you have to be uh borderline evil to

11590
04:02:15,710 --> 04:02:15,720
you have to be uh borderline evil to
 

11591
04:02:15,720 --> 04:02:18,110
you have to be uh borderline evil to
fight against a company like neuralink

11592
04:02:18,110 --> 04:02:18,120
fight against a company like neuralink
 

11593
04:02:18,120 --> 04:02:21,030
fight against a company like neuralink
or to constantly be taking pot shots at

options uh to reduce suffering uh we're

11604
04:02:33,070 --> 04:02:33,080
options uh to reduce suffering uh we're
 

11605
04:02:33,080 --> 04:02:36,790
options uh to reduce suffering uh we're
trying to we're trying to take the the

11606
04:02:36,790 --> 04:02:36,800
trying to we're trying to take the the
 

11607
04:02:36,800 --> 04:02:39,070
trying to we're trying to take the the
pain out of life

11608

pain out of life
 

11609
04:02:39,080 --> 04:02:44,990
pain out of life
that uh broken brains brings in and and

11610
04:02:44,990 --> 04:02:45,000
that uh broken brains brings in and and
 

11611
04:02:45,000 --> 04:02:48,389
that uh broken brains brings in and and
um yeah this is just our our little way

11612
04:02:48,389 --> 04:02:48,399
um yeah this is just our our little way
 

11613
04:02:48,399 --> 04:02:50,550
um yeah this is just our our little way
that we're fighting back against entropy

11614
04:02:50,550 --> 04:02:50,560
that we're fighting back against entropy
 

11615
04:02:50,560 --> 04:02:51,630
that we're fighting back against entropy
I

11616
04:02:51,630 --> 04:02:51,640
I
 

11617
04:02:51,640 --> 04:02:54,070
I
guess yeah this the the amount of

11618
04:02:54,070 --> 04:02:54,080
guess yeah this the the amount of
 

11619
04:02:54,080 --> 04:02:56,229
guess yeah this the the amount of
suffering that's endured when some of

11620
04:02:56,229 --> 04:02:56,239
suffering that's endured when some of
 

11621
04:02:56,239 --> 04:02:58,670
suffering that's endured when some of
the things that we take for granted that

11622
04:02:58,670 --> 04:02:58,680
the things that we take for granted that
 

11623
04:02:58,680 --> 04:03:01,070
the things that we take for granted that
our brain is able to do is taken away uh

11624
04:03:01,070 --> 04:03:01,080
our brain is able to do is taken away uh
 

11625
04:03:01,080 --> 04:03:03,710
our brain is able to do is taken away uh
is immense and to be able to restore

11626
04:03:03,710 --> 04:03:03,720
is immense and to be able to restore
 

11627
04:03:03,720 --> 04:03:05,469
is immense and to be able to restore
some of that functionality is a real

11628
04:03:05,469 --> 04:03:05,479
some of that functionality is a real
 

11629
04:03:05,479 --> 04:03:08,030
some of that functionality is a real
gift yeah we're just starting we're

11630
04:03:08,030 --> 04:03:08,040
gift yeah we're just starting we're
 

11631
04:03:08,040 --> 04:03:10,469
gift yeah we're just starting we're
we're going to we're going to do so much

11632
04:03:10,469 --> 04:03:10,479
we're going to we're going to do so much
 

11633
04:03:10,479 --> 04:03:13,349
we're going to we're going to do so much
more um well can you take me through the

11634
04:03:13,349 --> 04:03:13,359
more um well can you take me through the
 

11635
04:03:13,359 --> 04:03:17,269
more um well can you take me through the
full procedure of implanting say the N1

11636
04:03:17,269 --> 04:03:17,279
full procedure of implanting say the N1
 

11637
04:03:17,279 --> 04:03:20,149
full procedure of implanting say the N1
sure chip in New Link yeah it's a really

11638
04:03:20,149 --> 04:03:20,159
sure chip in New Link yeah it's a really
 

11639
04:03:20,159 --> 04:03:22,349
sure chip in New Link yeah it's a really
simple really simple straightforward

11640
04:03:22,349 --> 04:03:22,359
simple really simple straightforward
 

11641
04:03:22,359 --> 04:03:25,030
simple really simple straightforward
procedure uh the the human part of the

11642
04:03:25,030 --> 04:03:25,040
procedure uh the the human part of the
 

11643
04:03:25,040 --> 04:03:28,189
procedure uh the the human part of the
surgery uh that that I do

11644
04:03:28,189 --> 04:03:28,199
surgery uh that that I do
 

11645
04:03:28,199 --> 04:03:30,830
surgery uh that that I do
is dead simple it's one of the most

11646
04:03:30,830 --> 04:03:30,840
is dead simple it's one of the most
 

11647
04:03:30,840 --> 04:03:32,750
is dead simple it's one of the most
basic neurosurgery

11648
04:03:32,750 --> 04:03:32,760
basic neurosurgery
 

11649
04:03:32,760 --> 04:03:35,389
basic neurosurgery
procedures imaginable and I think

11650
04:03:35,389 --> 04:03:35,399
procedures imaginable and I think
 

11651
04:03:35,399 --> 04:03:37,590
procedures imaginable and I think
there's evidence that it some version of

11652
04:03:37,590 --> 04:03:37,600
there's evidence that it some version of
 

11653
04:03:37,600 --> 04:03:40,469
there's evidence that it some version of
it has been done for thousands of years

11654
04:03:40,469 --> 04:03:40,479
it has been done for thousands of years
 

11655
04:03:40,479 --> 04:03:42,830
it has been done for thousands of years
uh there are examples I think from

11656
04:03:42,830 --> 04:03:42,840
uh there are examples I think from
 

11657
04:03:42,840 --> 04:03:45,670
uh there are examples I think from
ancient Egypt of healed or partially

11658
04:03:45,670 --> 04:03:45,680
ancient Egypt of healed or partially
 

11659
04:03:45,680 --> 04:03:50,349
ancient Egypt of healed or partially
healed uh tations and from uh Peru or

11660
04:03:50,349 --> 04:03:50,359
healed uh tations and from uh Peru or
 

11661
04:03:50,359 --> 04:03:53,590
healed uh tations and from uh Peru or
you know ancient times in South America

11662
04:03:53,590 --> 04:03:53,600
you know ancient times in South America
 

11663
04:03:53,600 --> 04:03:57,229
you know ancient times in South America
uh where uh these Proto surgeons would

11664
04:03:57,229 --> 04:03:57,239
uh where uh these Proto surgeons would
 

11665
04:03:57,239 --> 04:03:59,910
uh where uh these Proto surgeons would
drill holes in people's skulls you know

11666
04:03:59,910 --> 04:03:59,920
drill holes in people's skulls you know
 

11667
04:03:59,920 --> 04:04:01,910
drill holes in people's skulls you know
presumably to let out the evil spirits

11668
04:04:01,910 --> 04:04:01,920
presumably to let out the evil spirits
 

11669
04:04:01,920 --> 04:04:04,750
presumably to let out the evil spirits
but maybe to drain blood clots and

11670
04:04:04,750 --> 04:04:04,760
but maybe to drain blood clots and
 

11671
04:04:04,760 --> 04:04:06,269
but maybe to drain blood clots and
there's evidence of bone healing around

11672
04:04:06,269 --> 04:04:06,279
there's evidence of bone healing around
 

11673
04:04:06,279 --> 04:04:07,790
there's evidence of bone healing around
the edge meaning the people at least

11674
04:04:07,790 --> 04:04:07,800
the edge meaning the people at least
 

11675
04:04:07,800 --> 04:04:11,790
the edge meaning the people at least
survive some months uh after a procedure

11676
04:04:11,790 --> 04:04:11,800
survive some months uh after a procedure
 

11677
04:04:11,800 --> 04:04:14,110
survive some months uh after a procedure
and so what we're doing is that we are

11678
04:04:14,110 --> 04:04:14,120
and so what we're doing is that we are
 

11679
04:04:14,120 --> 04:04:16,030
and so what we're doing is that we are
making a cut in the skin on the top of

11680
04:04:16,030 --> 04:04:16,040
making a cut in the skin on the top of
 

11681
04:04:16,040 --> 04:04:18,550
making a cut in the skin on the top of
the head over the area of the brain that

11682
04:04:18,550 --> 04:04:18,560
the head over the area of the brain that
 

11683
04:04:18,560 --> 04:04:23,510
the head over the area of the brain that
is the most potent uh representation of

11684
04:04:23,510 --> 04:04:23,520
is the most potent uh representation of
 

11685
04:04:23,520 --> 04:04:27,710
is the most potent uh representation of
hand intentions and so if you if you

11686
04:04:27,710 --> 04:04:27,720
hand intentions and so if you if you
 

11687
04:04:27,720 --> 04:04:30,990
hand intentions and so if you if you
are an expert concert pianist you know

11688
04:04:30,990 --> 04:04:31,000
are an expert concert pianist you know
 

11689
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:32,950
are an expert concert pianist you know
this part of your brain is lighting up

11690
04:04:32,950 --> 04:04:32,960
this part of your brain is lighting up
 

11691
04:04:32,960 --> 04:04:35,630
this part of your brain is lighting up
the entire time you're playing we call

11692
04:04:35,630 --> 04:04:35,640
the entire time you're playing we call
 

11693
04:04:35,640 --> 04:04:38,389
the entire time you're playing we call
it the hand knob the hand knob so it's

11694
04:04:38,389 --> 04:04:38,399
it the hand knob the hand knob so it's
 

11695
04:04:38,399 --> 04:04:40,149
it the hand knob the hand knob so it's
all the like the finger movements all

11696
04:04:40,149 --> 04:04:40,159
all the like the finger movements all
 

11697
04:04:40,159 --> 04:04:42,950
all the like the finger movements all
this all yeah all of that is just firing

11698
04:04:42,950 --> 04:04:42,960
this all yeah all of that is just firing
 

11699
04:04:42,960 --> 04:04:44,990
this all yeah all of that is just firing
away yep there's a little squiggle in

11700
04:04:44,990 --> 04:04:45,000
away yep there's a little squiggle in
 

11701
04:04:45,000 --> 04:04:46,710
away yep there's a little squiggle in
the cortex right there one of the folds

11702
04:04:46,710 --> 04:04:46,720
the cortex right there one of the folds
 

11703
04:04:46,720 --> 04:04:49,469
the cortex right there one of the folds
in the brain is kind of doubly folded

11704
04:04:49,469 --> 04:04:49,479
in the brain is kind of doubly folded
 

11705
04:04:49,479 --> 04:04:50,990
in the brain is kind of doubly folded
right on that spot and so you can look

11706
04:04:50,990 --> 04:04:51,000
right on that spot and so you can look
 

11707
04:04:51,000 --> 04:04:54,309
right on that spot and so you can look
at it on an MRI and say that's the hand

11708
04:04:54,309 --> 04:04:54,319
at it on an MRI and say that's the hand
 

11709
04:04:54,319 --> 04:04:56,790
at it on an MRI and say that's the hand
knob and then you you do a functional

11710
04:04:56,790 --> 04:04:56,800
knob and then you you do a functional
 

11711
04:04:56,800 --> 04:04:59,469
knob and then you you do a functional
test in a special kind of MRI called an

11712
04:04:59,469 --> 04:04:59,479
test in a special kind of MRI called an
 

11713
04:04:59,479 --> 04:05:01,189
test in a special kind of MRI called an
a functional MRI

11714
04:05:01,189 --> 04:05:01,199
a functional MRI
 

11715
04:05:01,199 --> 04:05:03,550
a functional MRI
fmri and this part of the brain lights

11716
04:05:03,550 --> 04:05:03,560
fmri and this part of the brain lights
 

11717
04:05:03,560 --> 04:05:05,790
fmri and this part of the brain lights
up when people even quadriplegic people

11718
04:05:05,790 --> 04:05:05,800
up when people even quadriplegic people
 

11719
04:05:05,800 --> 04:05:07,349
up when people even quadriplegic people
whose brains aren't connected to their

11720
04:05:07,349 --> 04:05:07,359
whose brains aren't connected to their
 

11721
04:05:07,359 --> 04:05:10,189
whose brains aren't connected to their
finger movements anymore they imagine

11722
04:05:10,189 --> 04:05:10,199
finger movements anymore they imagine
 

11723
04:05:10,199 --> 04:05:11,389
finger movements anymore they imagine
finger movements and this part of the

11724
04:05:11,389 --> 04:05:11,399
finger movements and this part of the
 

11725
04:05:11,399 --> 04:05:15,229
finger movements and this part of the
brain still lights up so we can ID that

11726
04:05:15,229 --> 04:05:15,239
brain still lights up so we can ID that
 

11727
04:05:15,239 --> 04:05:17,630
brain still lights up so we can ID that
part of the brain in anyone who's

11728
04:05:17,630 --> 04:05:17,640
part of the brain in anyone who's
 

11729
04:05:17,640 --> 04:05:21,550
part of the brain in anyone who's
preparing to enter our trial and say

11730
04:05:21,550 --> 04:05:21,560
preparing to enter our trial and say
 

11731
04:05:21,560 --> 04:05:23,229
preparing to enter our trial and say
okay that that part of the brain we

11732
04:05:23,229 --> 04:05:23,239
okay that that part of the brain we
 

11733
04:05:23,239 --> 04:05:25,910
okay that that part of the brain we
confirm is your hand intention

11734
04:05:25,910 --> 04:05:25,920
confirm is your hand intention
 

11735
04:05:25,920 --> 04:05:30,030
confirm is your hand intention
area um and so uh I'll make a little cut

11736
04:05:30,030 --> 04:05:30,040
area um and so uh I'll make a little cut
 

11737
04:05:30,040 --> 04:05:33,070
area um and so uh I'll make a little cut
in the skin we'll flap the skin open

11738
04:05:33,070 --> 04:05:33,080
in the skin we'll flap the skin open
 

11739
04:05:33,080 --> 04:05:34,510
in the skin we'll flap the skin open
just like kind of opening the hood of a

11740
04:05:34,510 --> 04:05:34,520
just like kind of opening the hood of a
 

11741
04:05:34,520 --> 04:05:36,229
just like kind of opening the hood of a
car only a lot

11742

remove remove that bit of
 

11749
04:05:45,359 --> 04:05:48,469
remove remove that bit of
skull uh open the lining of the brain

11750
04:05:48,469 --> 04:05:48,479
skull uh open the lining of the brain
 

11751
04:05:48,479 --> 04:05:50,670

the covering of the brain it's like a

11752
04:05:50,670 --> 04:05:50,680
the covering of the brain it's like a
 

11753
04:05:50,680 --> 04:05:52,149
the covering of the brain it's like a
like a little bag of water that the

11754
04:05:52,149 --> 04:05:52,159
like a little bag of water that the
 

11755
04:05:52,159 --> 04:05:56,269
like a little bag of water that the
brain floats in and then show that part

11756
04:05:56,269 --> 04:05:56,279
brain floats in and then show that part
 

11757
04:05:56,279 --> 04:05:58,149
brain floats in and then show that part
of the brain to our

of the brain to our
 

11759
04:05:58,159 --> 04:06:00,149
of the brain to our
robot and then the this is where the

11760
04:06:00,149 --> 04:06:00,159
robot and then the this is where the
 

11761
04:06:00,159 --> 04:06:02,910
robot and then the this is where the
robot shines it can come in and take

04:06:23,229 --> 04:06:23,239
the brain and after the robot's done
 

11779
04:06:23,239 --> 04:06:25,030
the brain and after the robot's done
with its part then you know the human

11780
04:06:25,030 --> 04:06:25,040
with its part then you know the human
 

11781
04:06:25,040 --> 04:06:28,670
with its part then you know the human
comes back in and puts the implant into

11782
04:06:28,670 --> 04:06:28,680
comes back in and puts the implant into
 

11783
04:06:28,680 --> 04:06:31,910
comes back in and puts the implant into
that hole in the skull and covers it up

11784
04:06:31,910 --> 04:06:31,920
that hole in the skull and covers it up
 

11785
04:06:31,920 --> 04:06:34,070
that hole in the skull and covers it up
uh screwing it down to the skull and

11786
04:06:34,070 --> 04:06:34,080
uh screwing it down to the skull and
 

11787
04:06:34,080 --> 04:06:35,990
uh screwing it down to the skull and
sewing the skin back

11788
04:06:35,990 --> 04:06:36,000
sewing the skin back
 

11789
04:06:36,000 --> 04:06:38,510
sewing the skin back
together um so the whole thing is you

11790
04:06:38,510 --> 04:06:38,520
together um so the whole thing is you
 

11791

04:07:18,159 --> 04:07:20,990
are designed to avoid the blood vessels
exactly so uh I know you're a bit biased

11820
04:07:20,990 --> 04:07:21,000
exactly so uh I know you're a bit biased
 

11821
04:07:21,000 --> 04:07:23,750
exactly so uh I know you're a bit biased
here but let's compare human and machine

11822
04:07:23,750 --> 04:07:23,760
here but let's compare human and machine
 

11823
04:07:23,760 --> 04:07:27,550
here but let's compare human and machine
sure so what are human surgeons able to

11824
04:07:27,550 --> 04:07:27,560
sure so what are human surgeons able to
 

11825
04:07:27,560 --> 04:07:31,590
sure so what are human surgeons able to
do well and what are robot surgeons able

11826
04:07:31,590 --> 04:07:31,600
do well and what are robot surgeons able
 

11827
04:07:31,600 --> 04:07:32,830
do well and what are robot surgeons able
to do

11828
04:07:32,830 --> 04:07:32,840
to do
 

11829
04:07:32,840 --> 04:07:35,710
to do
well at this stage of our human

11830
04:07:35,710 --> 04:07:35,720
well at this stage of our human
 

11831
04:07:35,720 --> 04:07:37,750
well at this stage of our human
civilization development yeah yeah

11832
04:07:37,750 --> 04:07:37,760
civilization development yeah yeah
 

11833
04:07:37,760 --> 04:07:40,710
civilization development yeah yeah
that's a good question um

11834
04:07:40,710 --> 04:07:40,720
that's a good question um
 

11835
04:07:40,720 --> 04:07:44,429
that's a good question um
humans uh are general purpose machines

11836
04:07:44,429 --> 04:07:44,439
humans uh are general purpose machines
 

11837
04:07:44,439 --> 04:07:48,109
humans uh are general purpose machines
were able to adapt to unusual situations

11838
04:07:48,109 --> 04:07:48,119
were able to adapt to unusual situations
 

11839
04:07:48,119 --> 04:07:50,229
were able to adapt to unusual situations
we're able to change the plan on the

11840
04:07:50,229 --> 04:07:50,239
we're able to change the plan on the
 

11841
04:07:50,239 --> 04:07:52,349
we're able to change the plan on the
Fly

11842
04:07:52,349 --> 04:07:52,359
Fly
 

11843
04:07:52,359 --> 04:07:56,229

um I remember well a surgery that I was

11844
04:07:56,229 --> 04:07:56,239
um I remember well a surgery that I was
 

11845
04:07:56,239 --> 04:07:59,269
um I remember well a surgery that I was
doing many years ago down in San Diego

11846
04:07:59,269 --> 04:07:59,279
doing many years ago down in San Diego
 

11847
04:07:59,279 --> 04:08:01,710
doing many years ago down in San Diego
where the plan was

11848
04:08:01,710 --> 04:08:01,720
where the plan was
 

11849
04:08:01,720 --> 04:08:06,229
where the plan was
to um open a small hole behind the ear

11850
04:08:06,229 --> 04:08:06,239
to um open a small hole behind the ear
 

11851
04:08:06,239 --> 04:08:08,750
to um open a small hole behind the ear
and go reposition a blood vessel that

11852
04:08:08,750 --> 04:08:08,760
and go reposition a blood vessel that
 

11853
04:08:08,760 --> 04:08:11,309
and go reposition a blood vessel that
had come to lay on the facial nerve the

11854
04:08:11,309 --> 04:08:11,319
had come to lay on the facial nerve the
 

11855
04:08:11,319 --> 04:08:13,870
had come to lay on the facial nerve the
trigeminal nerve uh the nerve that goes

11856
04:08:13,870 --> 04:08:13,880
trigeminal nerve uh the nerve that goes
 

11857
04:08:13,880 --> 04:08:16,070
trigeminal nerve uh the nerve that goes
to the face when that blood vessel lays

11858
04:08:16,070 --> 04:08:16,080
to the face when that blood vessel lays
 

11859
04:08:16,080 --> 04:08:19,109
to the face when that blood vessel lays
on the nerve it can cause just

11860
04:08:19,109 --> 04:08:19,119
on the nerve it can cause just
 

11861
04:08:19,119 --> 04:08:21,870
on the nerve it can cause just
intolerable horrific shooting pain that

11862
04:08:21,870 --> 04:08:21,880
intolerable horrific shooting pain that
 

11863
04:08:21,880 --> 04:08:23,670
intolerable horrific shooting pain that
people describe like being zapped with a

11864
04:08:23,670 --> 04:08:23,680
people describe like being zapped with a
 

11865
04:08:23,680 --> 04:08:26,349
people describe like being zapped with a
cattle prod and so the beautiful elegant

11866
04:08:26,349 --> 04:08:26,359
cattle prod and so the beautiful elegant
 

11867
04:08:26,359 --> 04:08:28,149
cattle prod and so the beautiful elegant
surgery is to go move this blood vessel

11868
04:08:28,149 --> 04:08:28,159
surgery is to go move this blood vessel
 

11869
04:08:28,159 --> 04:08:32,429
surgery is to go move this blood vessel
off the off the nerve the surgery team

11870
04:08:32,429 --> 04:08:32,439
off the off the nerve the surgery team
 

11871
04:08:32,439 --> 04:08:34,469
off the off the nerve the surgery team
we we went in there and started moving

11872
04:08:34,469 --> 04:08:34,479
we we went in there and started moving
 

11873
04:08:34,479 --> 04:08:35,950
we we went in there and started moving
this blood vessel and then found that

11874
04:08:35,950 --> 04:08:35,960
this blood vessel and then found that
 

11875
04:08:35,960 --> 04:08:38,109
this blood vessel and then found that
there was a giant aneurysm on that blood

11876
04:08:38,109 --> 04:08:38,119
there was a giant aneurysm on that blood
 

11877
04:08:38,119 --> 04:08:40,149
there was a giant aneurysm on that blood
vessel that was not easily visible on

11878
04:08:40,149 --> 04:08:40,159
vessel that was not easily visible on
 

11879
04:08:40,159 --> 04:08:42,870
vessel that was not easily visible on
the preop scans and so the plant had to

11880
04:08:42,870 --> 04:08:42,880
the preop scans and so the plant had to
 

11881
04:08:42,880 --> 04:08:46,910
the preop scans and so the plant had to
dynamically change and that the um human

11882
04:08:46,910 --> 04:08:46,920
dynamically change and that the um human
 

11883
04:08:46,920 --> 04:08:48,469
dynamically change and that the um human
surgeons had no problem with that were

11884
04:08:48,469 --> 04:08:48,479
surgeons had no problem with that were
 

11885
04:08:48,479 --> 04:08:51,469
surgeons had no problem with that were
trained for all those things robots

11886
04:08:51,469 --> 04:08:51,479
trained for all those things robots
 

11887
04:08:51,479 --> 04:08:53,750
trained for all those things robots
wouldn't do so well in that situation at

11888
04:08:53,750 --> 04:08:53,760
wouldn't do so well in that situation at
 

11889
04:08:53,760 --> 04:08:55,429
wouldn't do so well in that situation at
least in their current

11890
04:08:55,429 --> 04:08:55,439
least in their current
 

11891
04:08:55,439 --> 04:08:58,070

Incarnation uh fully robotic surgery

11892
04:08:58,070 --> 04:08:58,080
Incarnation uh fully robotic surgery
 

11893
04:08:58,080 --> 04:09:00,349
Incarnation uh fully robotic surgery
like you know the the electrode

11894
04:09:00,349 --> 04:09:00,359
like you know the the electrode
 

11895
04:09:00,359 --> 04:09:03,229
like you know the the electrode
insertion portion of of the nerling

11896
04:09:03,229 --> 04:09:03,239
insertion portion of of the nerling
 

11897
04:09:03,239 --> 04:09:06,389
insertion portion of of the nerling
surgery it goes according to a set plan

11898
04:09:06,389 --> 04:09:06,399
surgery it goes according to a set plan
 

11899
04:09:06,399 --> 04:09:09,750
surgery it goes according to a set plan
and so the humans can interrupt the flow

11900
04:09:09,750 --> 04:09:09,760
and so the humans can interrupt the flow
 

11901
04:09:09,760 --> 04:09:12,309
and so the humans can interrupt the flow
and change the plan but the robot can't

11902
04:09:12,309 --> 04:09:12,319
and change the plan but the robot can't
 

11903
04:09:12,319 --> 04:09:14,710
and change the plan but the robot can't
really change the plan Midway through it

11904
04:09:14,710 --> 04:09:14,720
really change the plan Midway through it
 

11905

04:09:23,590 --> 04:09:23,600
it does its job very precisely uh but
 

11911
04:09:23,600 --> 04:09:26,349
it does its job very precisely uh but
not with a wide degree of latitude and

11912
04:09:26,349 --> 04:09:26,359
not with a wide degree of latitude and
 

11913
04:09:26,359 --> 04:09:29,550
not with a wide degree of latitude and
how to react to changing conditions so

11914
04:09:29,550 --> 04:09:29,560
how to react to changing conditions so
 

11915
04:09:29,560 --> 04:09:31,229
how to react to changing conditions so
there could be just a very large number

there could be just a very large number
 

11917
04:09:31,239 --> 04:09:32,870
there could be just a very large number
of ways that you could be surprised as a

appropriately uh and
so surgical robots aren't there yet but

11956
04:10:22,469 --> 04:10:22,479
so surgical robots aren't there yet but
 

11957
04:10:22,479 --> 04:10:24,349
so surgical robots aren't there yet but
give it time and then there could be a

11958
04:10:24,349 --> 04:10:24,359
give it time and then there could be a
 

11959
04:10:24,359 --> 04:10:25,710
give it time and then there could be a
lot of sort of inter like

11960
04:10:25,710 --> 04:10:25,720
lot of sort of inter like
 

11961
04:10:25,720 --> 04:10:29,269
lot of sort of inter like

04:10:29,279 --> 04:10:33,149
semi-autonomous possibilities of maybe a
robotic surgeon could say this situation

11964
04:10:33,149 --> 04:10:33,159
robotic surgeon could say this situation
 

11965
04:10:33,159 --> 04:10:35,469
robotic surgeon could say this situation
is perfectly familiar or the situation

11966
04:10:35,469 --> 04:10:35,479
is perfectly familiar or the situation
 

11967
04:10:35,479 --> 04:10:38,189
is perfectly familiar or the situation
is not familiar and in the not familiar

11968
04:10:38,189 --> 04:10:38,199
is not familiar and in the not familiar
 

11969
04:10:38,199 --> 04:10:40,030
is not familiar and in the not familiar
case a human could take over but

11970
04:10:40,030 --> 04:10:40,040
case a human could take over but
 

11971
04:10:40,040 --> 04:10:43,510
case a human could take over but
basically like be very conservative

11972
04:10:43,510 --> 04:10:43,520
basically like be very conservative
 

11973
04:10:43,520 --> 04:10:45,710
basically like be very conservative
okay this for sure has no issues no

11974
04:10:45,710 --> 04:10:45,720
okay this for sure has no issues no
 

11975
04:10:45,720 --> 04:10:47,990
okay this for sure has no issues no
surprises and then let the humans deal

11976
04:10:47,990 --> 04:10:48,000
surprises and then let the humans deal
 

11977
04:10:48,000 --> 04:10:49,510
surprises and then let the humans deal
with the Surprises with the edge cases

11978
04:10:49,510 --> 04:10:49,520
with the Surprises with the edge cases
 

11979
04:10:49,520 --> 04:10:52,389
with the Surprises with the edge cases
all that yeah uh that's one possibility

11980
04:10:52,389 --> 04:10:52,399
all that yeah uh that's one possibility
 

11981
04:10:52,399 --> 04:10:55,429
all that yeah uh that's one possibility
so like you think

11982
04:10:55,429 --> 04:10:55,439
so like you think
 

11983
04:10:55,439 --> 04:10:58,990
so like you think
eventually uh you'll be out of the job

11984
04:10:58,990 --> 04:10:59,000
eventually uh you'll be out of the job
 

11985
04:10:59,000 --> 04:11:01,229
eventually uh you'll be out of the job
what you being neurosurgeon your job

11986
04:11:01,229 --> 04:11:01,239
what you being neurosurgeon your job
 

11987
04:11:01,239 --> 04:11:03,750
what you being neurosurgeon your job
being neurosurgeon humans there will not

11988
04:11:03,750 --> 04:11:03,760
being neurosurgeon humans there will not
 

11989
04:11:03,760 --> 04:11:06,630
being neurosurgeon humans there will not
be many neurosurgeons left on this Earth

11990
04:11:06,630 --> 04:11:06,640
be many neurosurgeons left on this Earth
 

11991
04:11:06,640 --> 04:11:09,830
be many neurosurgeons left on this Earth
I'm not worried about my job in my in

11992
04:11:09,830 --> 04:11:09,840
I'm not worried about my job in my in
 

11993
04:11:09,840 --> 04:11:11,550
I'm not worried about my job in my in
the course of my professional

11994
04:11:11,550 --> 04:11:11,560
the course of my professional
 

11995
04:11:11,560 --> 04:11:14,870
the course of my professional
life I think I I would tell my my kids

11996
04:11:14,870 --> 04:11:14,880
life I think I I would tell my my kids
 

11997
04:11:14,880 --> 04:11:17,469
life I think I I would tell my my kids
not necessarily to go in this line of

11998
04:11:17,469 --> 04:11:17,479
not necessarily to go in this line of
 

11999
04:11:17,479 --> 04:11:19,710
not necessarily to go in this line of
work uh depending

12000
04:11:19,710 --> 04:11:19,720
work uh depending
 

12001
04:11:19,720 --> 04:11:23,229
work uh depending
on depending on how things look in 20

12002
04:11:23,229 --> 04:11:23,239
on depending on how things look in 20
 

12003
04:11:23,239 --> 04:11:25,349
on depending on how things look in 20
years it's so fascinating because I I

12004
04:11:25,349 --> 04:11:25,359
years it's so fascinating because I I
 

12005
04:11:25,359 --> 04:11:27,630
years it's so fascinating because I I
mean I if I have a line of work I would

12006
04:11:27,630 --> 04:11:27,640
mean I if I have a line of work I would
 

12007
04:11:27,640 --> 04:11:30,429
mean I if I have a line of work I would
say it's programming and if you ask me

12008
04:11:30,429 --> 04:11:30,439
say it's programming and if you ask me
 

12009
04:11:30,439 --> 04:11:33,149
say it's programming and if you ask me
like for the last I don't know 20 years

12010
04:11:33,149 --> 04:11:33,159
like for the last I don't know 20 years
 

12011
04:11:33,159 --> 04:11:35,149
like for the last I don't know 20 years
what I would recommend for people I

12012
04:11:35,149 --> 04:11:35,159
what I would recommend for people I
 

12013
04:11:35,159 --> 04:11:37,070
what I would recommend for people I
would I would tell them yeah go there's

12014
04:11:37,070 --> 04:11:37,080
would I would tell them yeah go there's
 

12015
04:11:37,080 --> 04:11:38,389
would I would tell them yeah go there's
this you will always have a job if

12016
04:11:38,389 --> 04:11:38,399
this you will always have a job if
 

12017
04:11:38,399 --> 04:11:39,750
this you will always have a job if
you're a programmer because there's more

12018
04:11:39,750 --> 04:11:39,760
you're a programmer because there's more
 

12019
04:11:39,760 --> 04:11:41,149
you're a programmer because there's more
and more computers and all this kind of

12020
04:11:41,149 --> 04:11:41,159
and more computers and all this kind of
 

12021
04:11:41,159 --> 04:11:44,710
and more computers and all this kind of
stuff and uh it pays well

12022
04:11:44,710 --> 04:11:44,720
stuff and uh it pays well
 

12023
04:11:44,720 --> 04:11:46,630
stuff and uh it pays well
but then you you realize these large

12024
04:11:46,630 --> 04:11:46,640
but then you you realize these large
 

12025
04:11:46,640 --> 04:11:48,149
but then you you realize these large
language models come along and they're

12026
04:11:48,149 --> 04:11:48,159
language models come along and they're
 

12027
04:11:48,159 --> 04:11:50,349
language models come along and they're
really damn good at generating code yeah

12028
04:11:50,349 --> 04:11:50,359
really damn good at generating code yeah
 

12029
04:11:50,359 --> 04:11:51,910
really damn good at generating code yeah
so it's over night you could be

12030
04:11:51,910 --> 04:11:51,920
so it's over night you could be
 

12031
04:11:51,920 --> 04:11:53,670
so it's over night you could be
surprised like wow wa what is the

12032
04:11:53,670 --> 04:11:53,680
surprised like wow wa what is the
 

12033
04:11:53,680 --> 04:11:55,630
surprised like wow wa what is the
contribution of the human really but

12034
04:11:55,630 --> 04:11:55,640
contribution of the human really but
 

12035
04:11:55,640 --> 04:11:57,630
contribution of the human really but
then you start to think okay it does

12036
04:11:57,630 --> 04:11:57,640
then you start to think okay it does
 

12037
04:11:57,640 --> 04:12:00,950
then you start to think okay it does
seem that humans have ability like you

12038
04:12:00,950 --> 04:12:00,960
seem that humans have ability like you
 

12039
04:12:00,960 --> 04:12:03,309
seem that humans have ability like you
said to deal with novel situations in

12040
04:12:03,309 --> 04:12:03,319
said to deal with novel situations in
 

12041
04:12:03,319 --> 04:12:05,950
said to deal with novel situations in
the case of programming it's the ability

12042
04:12:05,950 --> 04:12:05,960
the case of programming it's the ability
 

12043
04:12:05,960 --> 04:12:10,189
the case of programming it's the ability
to kind of come up with novel ideas to

12044
04:12:10,189 --> 04:12:10,199
to kind of come up with novel ideas to
 

12045
04:12:10,199 --> 04:12:13,750
to kind of come up with novel ideas to
solve problems it's it seems like like

12046
04:12:13,750 --> 04:12:13,760
solve problems it's it seems like like
 

12047
04:12:13,760 --> 04:12:15,750
solve problems it's it seems like like
machines aren't quite yet able to do

12048
04:12:15,750 --> 04:12:15,760
machines aren't quite yet able to do
 

12049
04:12:15,760 --> 04:12:17,389
machines aren't quite yet able to do
that and when the stakes are very high

12050
04:12:17,389 --> 04:12:17,399
that and when the stakes are very high
 

12051
04:12:17,399 --> 04:12:20,030
that and when the stakes are very high
when it's life critical as it is in

12052
04:12:20,030 --> 04:12:20,040
when it's life critical as it is in
 

12053
04:12:20,040 --> 04:12:23,149
when it's life critical as it is in
surgery especially neurosurgery then it

12054
04:12:23,149 --> 04:12:23,159
surgery especially neurosurgery then it
 

12055
04:12:23,159 --> 04:12:26,429
surgery especially neurosurgery then it
starts the the stakes are very high for

12056
04:12:26,429 --> 04:12:26,439
starts the the stakes are very high for
 

12057
04:12:26,439 --> 04:12:28,469
starts the the stakes are very high for
a robot to actually replace a human but

12058
04:12:28,469 --> 04:12:28,479
a robot to actually replace a human but
 

12059
04:12:28,479 --> 04:12:30,550
a robot to actually replace a human but
it's fascinating that in this case of

12060
04:12:30,550 --> 04:12:30,560
it's fascinating that in this case of
 

12061
04:12:30,560 --> 04:12:33,429
it's fascinating that in this case of
neuralink there's a uh human robot

12062
04:12:33,429 --> 04:12:33,439
neuralink there's a uh human robot
 

12063
04:12:33,439 --> 04:12:36,229
neuralink there's a uh human robot
collaboration yeah yeah it's I do the

12064
04:12:36,229 --> 04:12:36,239
collaboration yeah yeah it's I do the
 

12065
04:12:36,239 --> 04:12:38,349
collaboration yeah yeah it's I do the
parts I can't do and it does the parts I

12066
04:12:38,349 --> 04:12:38,359
parts I can't do and it does the parts I
 

12067
04:12:38,359 --> 04:12:44,550
parts I can't do and it does the parts I
can't do um and we we are friends

12068
04:12:44,550 --> 04:12:44,560

 

12069
04:12:44,560 --> 04:12:47,630

uh I I saw that there's a lot of

12070
04:12:47,630 --> 04:12:47,640
uh I I saw that there's a lot of
 

12071
04:12:47,640 --> 04:12:50,510
uh I I saw that there's a lot of
practice going on so I mean everything

12072
04:12:50,510 --> 04:12:50,520
practice going on so I mean everything
 

12073
04:12:50,520 --> 04:12:53,149
practice going on so I mean everything
in New link is is tested extremely

12074
04:12:53,149 --> 04:12:53,159
in New link is is tested extremely
 

12075
04:12:53,159 --> 04:12:55,309
in New link is is tested extremely
rigorously but one of the things I saw

12076
04:12:55,309 --> 04:12:55,319
rigorously but one of the things I saw
 

12077
04:12:55,319 --> 04:12:57,189
rigorously but one of the things I saw
that there's a proxy on which the

12078
04:12:57,189 --> 04:12:57,199
that there's a proxy on which the
 

12079
04:12:57,199 --> 04:12:59,510
that there's a proxy on which the
surgeries are performed yeah so this is

12080
04:12:59,510 --> 04:12:59,520
surgeries are performed yeah so this is
 

12081
04:12:59,520 --> 04:13:02,349
surgeries are performed yeah so this is
both for the robot and for the human for

12082
04:13:02,349 --> 04:13:02,359
both for the robot and for the human for
 

12083
04:13:02,359 --> 04:13:03,830
both for the robot and for the human for
everybody involved in the entire

12084
04:13:03,830 --> 04:13:03,840
everybody involved in the entire
 

12085
04:13:03,840 --> 04:13:06,630
everybody involved in the entire
pipeline yep what's that like practicing

12086
04:13:06,630 --> 04:13:06,640
pipeline yep what's that like practicing
 

12087
04:13:06,640 --> 04:13:09,870
pipeline yep what's that like practicing
the surgery it's pretty intense uh so

12088
04:13:09,870 --> 04:13:09,880
the surgery it's pretty intense uh so
 

12089
04:13:09,880 --> 04:13:13,790
the surgery it's pretty intense uh so
there's no analog to this in human

12090
04:13:13,790 --> 04:13:13,800
there's no analog to this in human
 

12091
04:13:13,800 --> 04:13:16,750
there's no analog to this in human
surgery uh human surgery is sort of this

12092
04:13:16,750 --> 04:13:16,760
surgery uh human surgery is sort of this
 

12093
04:13:16,760 --> 04:13:18,990
surgery uh human surgery is sort of this
artisanal craft that's handed down

12094
04:13:18,990 --> 04:13:19,000
artisanal craft that's handed down
 

12095
04:13:19,000 --> 04:13:21,990
artisanal craft that's handed down
directly from Master to pupil over the

12096
04:13:21,990 --> 04:13:22,000
directly from Master to pupil over the
 

12097
04:13:22,000 --> 04:13:24,269
directly from Master to pupil over the
generations yes I mean literally the way

12098
04:13:24,269 --> 04:13:24,279
generations yes I mean literally the way
 

12099
04:13:24,279 --> 04:13:28,269
generations yes I mean literally the way
you learn to be a surgeon on humans is

12100
04:13:28,269 --> 04:13:28,279
you learn to be a surgeon on humans is
 

12101
04:13:28,279 --> 04:13:32,189
you learn to be a surgeon on humans is
by doing surgery on humans I mean first

12102
04:13:32,189 --> 04:13:32,199
by doing surgery on humans I mean first
 

12103
04:13:32,199 --> 04:13:33,429
by doing surgery on humans I mean first
you

12104
04:13:33,429 --> 04:13:33,439
you
 

12105
04:13:33,439 --> 04:13:37,510
you
watch uh your professors do a bunch of

12106
04:13:37,510 --> 04:13:37,520
watch uh your professors do a bunch of
 

12107
04:13:37,520 --> 04:13:39,349
watch uh your professors do a bunch of
surgery and then finally they put you

12108
04:13:39,349 --> 04:13:39,359
surgery and then finally they put you
 

12109
04:13:39,359 --> 04:13:40,750
surgery and then finally they put you
know the trivial parts of the surgery

12110
04:13:40,750 --> 04:13:40,760
know the trivial parts of the surgery
 

12111
04:13:40,760 --> 04:13:43,070
know the trivial parts of the surgery
into your hands and then the more comp

12112
04:13:43,070 --> 04:13:43,080
into your hands and then the more comp
 

12113
04:13:43,080 --> 04:13:45,189
into your hands and then the more comp
Le Lex parts and as your understanding

12114
04:13:45,189 --> 04:13:45,199
Le Lex parts and as your understanding
 

12115
04:13:45,199 --> 04:13:47,469
Le Lex parts and as your understanding
of the the point and the purposes of the

12116
04:13:47,469 --> 04:13:47,479
of the the point and the purposes of the
 

12117
04:13:47,479 --> 04:13:49,710
of the the point and the purposes of the
surgery increases you get more

12118
04:13:49,710 --> 04:13:49,720
surgery increases you get more
 

12119
04:13:49,720 --> 04:13:52,070
surgery increases you get more
responsibility in the perfect condition

12120
04:13:52,070 --> 04:13:52,080
responsibility in the perfect condition
 

12121
04:13:52,080 --> 04:13:54,910
responsibility in the perfect condition
doesn't always go well in neural Link's

12122
04:13:54,910 --> 04:13:54,920
doesn't always go well in neural Link's
 

12123
04:13:54,920 --> 04:13:59,070
doesn't always go well in neural Link's
case the approach is a bit different um

12124
04:13:59,070 --> 04:13:59,080
case the approach is a bit different um
 

12125
04:13:59,080 --> 04:14:01,830
case the approach is a bit different um
we of course practiced as far as we

12126
04:14:01,830 --> 04:14:01,840
we of course practiced as far as we
 

12127
04:14:01,840 --> 04:14:03,790
we of course practiced as far as we
could on animals we did hundreds of

12128
04:14:03,790 --> 04:14:03,800
could on animals we did hundreds of
 

12129

12132
04:14:08,950 --> 04:14:08,960
surgeries um and when it came time to do
 

12133
04:14:08,960 --> 04:14:12,710
surgeries um and when it came time to do
the first human uh we had a just a

12134
04:14:12,710 --> 04:14:12,720
the first human uh we had a just a
 

12135
04:14:12,720 --> 04:14:15,149
the first human uh we had a just a
amazing team of engineers

04:14:18,520 --> 04:14:20,389
build incredibly lifelike models one of
the engineers Fran Romano in particular

12140
04:14:20,389 --> 04:14:20,399
the engineers Fran Romano in particular
 

12141
04:14:20,399 --> 04:14:23,750
the engineers Fran Romano in particular
built built a pulsating brain in a

12142
04:14:23,750 --> 04:14:23,760
built built a pulsating brain in a
 

12143
04:14:23,760 --> 04:14:27,309
built built a pulsating brain in a
custom 3D printed skull that matches

custom 3D printed skull that matches
 

12145
04:14:27,319 --> 04:14:29,950
custom 3D printed skull that matches
exactly the the patients

12146
04:14:29,950 --> 04:14:29,960
exactly the the patients

so when I was able to practice that I

12152
04:14:39,269 --> 04:14:39,279
so when I was able to practice that I
 

12153
04:14:39,279 --> 04:14:41,550
so when I was able to practice that I
mean it's as close as it really

12154
04:14:41,550 --> 04:14:41,560
mean it's as close as it really
 

12155
04:14:41,560 --> 04:14:43,870
mean it's as close as it really
reasonably should get

12156
04:14:43,870 --> 04:14:43,880
reasonably should get
 

12157
04:14:43,880 --> 04:14:47,429
reasonably should get
uh to to being the real thing in all the

12158
04:14:47,429 --> 04:14:47,439
uh to to being the real thing in all the
 

12159
04:14:47,439 --> 04:14:50,630
uh to to being the real thing in all the
details including you know the having a

12160
04:14:50,630 --> 04:14:50,640
details including you know the having a
 

12161
04:14:50,640 --> 04:14:53,830

a Manakin body attached to this custom
 

12163
04:14:53,840 --> 04:14:55,990
a Manakin body attached to this custom
head and so when we were doing the

12164
04:14:55,990 --> 04:14:56,000
head and so when we were doing the
 

12165
04:14:56,000 --> 04:14:59,469
head and so when we were doing the
practice surgeries we'd wheel that body

12166
04:14:59,469 --> 04:14:59,479
practice surgeries we'd wheel that body
 

12167
04:14:59,479 --> 04:15:02,630
practice surgeries we'd wheel that body
into the CT scanner and take a mock CT

12168
04:15:02,630 --> 04:15:02,640
into the CT scanner and take a mock CT
 

12169
04:15:02,640 --> 04:15:05,189

04:17:33,040 --> 04:17:35,950
so uh definitely a a moderate pucker
Factor there for the whole team uh not

12284
04:17:35,950 --> 04:17:35,960
Factor there for the whole team uh not
 

12285
04:17:35,960 --> 04:17:39,109
Factor there for the whole team uh not
knowing if we were going to encounter

12286
04:17:39,109 --> 04:17:39,119
knowing if we were going to encounter
 

12287
04:17:39,119 --> 04:17:43,790
knowing if we were going to encounter
say a degree of brain movement that was

12288
04:17:43,790 --> 04:17:43,800
say a degree of brain movement that was
 

12289
04:17:43,800 --> 04:17:46,349
say a degree of brain movement that was
unanticipated or uh a degree of brain

12290
04:17:46,349 --> 04:17:46,359
unanticipated or uh a degree of brain
 

12291
04:17:46,359 --> 04:17:49,070
unanticipated or uh a degree of brain
sag that took the brain far away from

04:17:49,070 --> 04:17:49,080
sag that took the brain far away from
 

12293
04:17:49,080 --> 04:17:51,349
sag that took the brain far away from
the skull and made it difficult to

12294
04:17:51,349 --> 04:17:51,359
the skull and made it difficult to
 

12295
04:17:51,359 --> 04:17:53,630
the skull and made it difficult to
insert or some other unknown unknown

12296
04:17:53,630 --> 04:17:53,640
insert or some other unknown unknown
 

12297
04:17:53,640 --> 04:17:56,550
insert or some other unknown unknown
problem fortunately everything uh went

12298
04:17:56,550 --> 04:17:56,560
problem fortunately everything uh went
 

12299
04:17:56,560 --> 04:17:59,550
problem fortunately everything uh went
well and that that surgery was one of

12300
04:17:59,550 --> 04:17:59,560
well and that that surgery was one of
 

12301
04:17:59,560 --> 04:18:00,229
well and that that surgery was one of
the

12302

the
 

12303
04:18:00,239 --> 04:18:02,189
the
smoothest uh outcomes we could have

12304
04:18:02,189 --> 04:18:02,199
smoothest uh outcomes we could have
 

12305
04:18:02,199 --> 04:18:04,429
smoothest uh outcomes we could have
imagined were you nervous I mean you're

went well and then and when it was over
um looking forward to number two yeah

12316
04:18:17,510 --> 04:18:17,520
um looking forward to number two yeah
 

12317
04:18:17,520 --> 04:18:19,189
um looking forward to number two yeah
even with all that practice all of that

12318
04:18:19,189 --> 04:18:19,199
even with all that practice all of that
 

12319
04:18:19,199 --> 04:18:21,469
even with all that practice all of that
just you've never been in a situation

12320
04:18:21,469 --> 04:18:21,479
just you've never been in a situation
 

12321
04:18:21,479 --> 04:18:23,269
just you've never been in a situation
that's so high stakes in terms of people

12322
04:18:23,269 --> 04:18:23,279
that's so high stakes in terms of people
 

12323
04:18:23,279 --> 04:18:25,349
that's so high stakes in terms of people
watching yeah and we should also

12324
04:18:25,349 --> 04:18:25,359
watching yeah and we should also
 

12325
04:18:25,359 --> 04:18:27,269
watching yeah and we should also
probably mention given how the media

12326
04:18:27,269 --> 04:18:27,279
probably mention given how the media
 

12327
04:18:27,279 --> 04:18:28,870
probably mention given how the media
works a lot of

12328
04:18:28,870 --> 04:18:28,880
works a lot of
 

12329
04:18:28,880 --> 04:18:33,109
works a lot of
people um you know maybe in a dark kind

12330
04:18:33,109 --> 04:18:33,119
people um you know maybe in a dark kind
 

12331
04:18:33,119 --> 04:18:36,229
people um you know maybe in a dark kind
of way hoping it doesn't go well well I

12332
04:18:36,229 --> 04:18:36,239
of way hoping it doesn't go well well I
 

12333
04:18:36,239 --> 04:18:39,990
of way hoping it doesn't go well well I
think wealth is easy to hate um or Envy

12334
04:18:39,990 --> 04:18:40,000
think wealth is easy to hate um or Envy
 

12335
04:18:40,000 --> 04:18:44,550
think wealth is easy to hate um or Envy
or or whatever and uh I think there's a

12336
04:18:44,550 --> 04:18:44,560
or or whatever and uh I think there's a
 

12337
04:18:44,560 --> 04:18:47,469
or or whatever and uh I think there's a
whole industry around driving

12338
04:18:47,469 --> 04:18:47,479
whole industry around driving
 

12339
04:18:47,479 --> 04:18:50,910
whole industry around driving
clicks and bad news is great for clicks

12340
04:18:50,910 --> 04:18:50,920
clicks and bad news is great for clicks
 

12341
04:18:50,920 --> 04:18:54,750
clicks and bad news is great for clicks
and so any way to take an event and turn

12342
04:18:54,750 --> 04:18:54,760
and so any way to take an event and turn
 

12343
04:18:54,760 --> 04:18:57,550
and so any way to take an event and turn
it into bad news uh is going to be

12344
04:18:57,550 --> 04:18:57,560
it into bad news uh is going to be
 

12345
04:18:57,560 --> 04:19:00,670
it into bad news uh is going to be
really good for for clicks it just sucks

12346
04:19:00,670 --> 04:19:00,680
really good for for clicks it just sucks
 

12347
04:19:00,680 --> 04:19:02,990
really good for for clicks it just sucks
because I think in it puts pressure on

12348
04:19:02,990 --> 04:19:03,000
because I think in it puts pressure on
 

12349
04:19:03,000 --> 04:19:04,990
because I think in it puts pressure on
people it discourages people

12350
04:19:04,990 --> 04:19:05,000
people it discourages people
 

12351
04:19:05,000 --> 04:19:07,550
people it discourages people
from from trying to solve really hard

12352
04:19:07,550 --> 04:19:07,560
from from trying to solve really hard
 

12353
04:19:07,560 --> 04:19:09,189
from from trying to solve really hard
problems because to solve hard problems

12354
04:19:09,189 --> 04:19:09,199
problems because to solve hard problems
 

12355
04:19:09,199 --> 04:19:11,229
problems because to solve hard problems
you have to go into the unknown you have

12356
04:19:11,229 --> 04:19:11,239
you have to go into the unknown you have
 

12357
04:19:11,239 --> 04:19:12,349
you have to go into the unknown you have
to do things that haven't been done

12358
04:19:12,349 --> 04:19:12,359
to do things that haven't been done
 

12359
04:19:12,359 --> 04:19:15,309
to do things that haven't been done
before and you have to take risks yeah

12360
04:19:15,309 --> 04:19:15,319
before and you have to take risks yeah
 

12361
04:19:15,319 --> 04:19:17,189
before and you have to take risks yeah
uh calculated risks you have to do all

12362
04:19:17,189 --> 04:19:17,199
uh calculated risks you have to do all
 

12363
04:19:17,199 --> 04:19:19,269
uh calculated risks you have to do all
kind of safety precautions but risks

12364
04:19:19,269 --> 04:19:19,279
kind of safety precautions but risks
 

12365
04:19:19,279 --> 04:19:22,030
kind of safety precautions but risks
nevertheless and uh I just wish there

12366
04:19:22,030 --> 04:19:22,040
nevertheless and uh I just wish there
 

12367
04:19:22,040 --> 04:19:23,870
nevertheless and uh I just wish there
would be more celebration of that of the

12368
04:19:23,870 --> 04:19:23,880
would be more celebration of that of the
 

12369
04:19:23,880 --> 04:19:26,590
would be more celebration of that of the
risk taking versus like yeah people just

12370
04:19:26,590 --> 04:19:26,600
risk taking versus like yeah people just
 

12371
04:19:26,600 --> 04:19:29,229
risk taking versus like yeah people just
waiting on the on on the sidelines like

12372
04:19:29,229 --> 04:19:29,239
waiting on the on on the sidelines like
 

12373
04:19:29,239 --> 04:19:31,030
waiting on the on on the sidelines like
waiting for failure yeah and then

12374
04:19:31,030 --> 04:19:31,040
waiting for failure yeah and then
 

12375
04:19:31,040 --> 04:19:33,349
waiting for failure yeah and then
pointing out the failure uh yeah it

12376
04:19:33,349 --> 04:19:33,359
pointing out the failure uh yeah it
 

12377
04:19:33,359 --> 04:19:35,910
pointing out the failure uh yeah it
sucks but you know in this case it's

12378
04:19:35,910 --> 04:19:35,920
sucks but you know in this case it's
 

12379
04:19:35,920 --> 04:19:37,189
sucks but you know in this case it's
it's it's really great that everything

12380
04:19:37,189 --> 04:19:37,199
it's it's really great that everything
 

12381
04:19:37,199 --> 04:19:39,349
it's it's really great that everything
went just flawlessly but it's

12382
04:19:39,349 --> 04:19:39,359
went just flawlessly but it's
 

12383
04:19:39,359 --> 04:19:41,990
went just flawlessly but it's
unnecessary pressure I would say now

12384
04:19:41,990 --> 04:19:42,000
unnecessary pressure I would say now
 

12385
04:19:42,000 --> 04:19:44,269
unnecessary pressure I would say now
that there is a human with literal skin

12386
04:19:44,269 --> 04:19:44,279
that there is a human with literal skin
 

12387
04:19:44,279 --> 04:19:46,349
that there is a human with literal skin
in the game you know there's a

12388
04:19:46,349 --> 04:19:46,359
in the game you know there's a
 

12389
04:19:46,359 --> 04:19:48,830
in the game you know there's a
participant who whose well-being rides

12390
04:19:48,830 --> 04:19:48,840
participant who whose well-being rides
 

12391
04:19:48,840 --> 04:19:50,710
participant who whose well-being rides
on this doing well you have to be a

12392
04:19:50,710 --> 04:19:50,720
on this doing well you have to be a
 

12393
04:19:50,720 --> 04:19:53,149
on this doing well you have to be a
pretty bad person to be rooting for that

12394
04:19:53,149 --> 04:19:53,159
pretty bad person to be rooting for that
 

12395
04:19:53,159 --> 04:19:56,630
pretty bad person to be rooting for that
to go wrong yeah um and so you know

12396
04:19:56,630 --> 04:19:56,640
to go wrong yeah um and so you know
 

12397
04:19:56,640 --> 04:19:58,469
to go wrong yeah um and so you know
hopefully people look in the mirror and

12398
04:19:58,469 --> 04:19:58,479
hopefully people look in the mirror and
 

12399
04:19:58,479 --> 04:20:00,630
hopefully people look in the mirror and
and realize that at some

12400
04:20:00,630 --> 04:20:00,640
and realize that at some
 

12401
04:20:00,640 --> 04:20:03,790
and realize that at some
point so did you get to actually front

12402
04:20:03,790 --> 04:20:03,800
point so did you get to actually front
 

12403
04:20:03,800 --> 04:20:05,910
point so did you get to actually front
row seat like watch the robot work like

12404
04:20:05,910 --> 04:20:05,920
row seat like watch the robot work like
 

12405
04:20:05,920 --> 04:20:08,349
row seat like watch the robot work like
what uh you get to see the whole thing

12406
04:20:08,349 --> 04:20:08,359
what uh you get to see the whole thing
 

12407
04:20:08,359 --> 04:20:11,269
what uh you get to see the whole thing
yeah I mean I you know because an MD

12408
04:20:11,269 --> 04:20:11,279
yeah I mean I you know because an MD
 

12409
04:20:11,279 --> 04:20:14,269
yeah I mean I you know because an MD
needs to be charge of all of the medical

12410
04:20:14,269 --> 04:20:14,279
needs to be charge of all of the medical
 

12411
04:20:14,279 --> 04:20:16,830
needs to be charge of all of the medical
decision- making throughout the process

12412
04:20:16,830 --> 04:20:16,840
decision- making throughout the process
 

12413
04:20:16,840 --> 04:20:19,830
decision- making throughout the process
um I unscrubbed from the

12414
04:20:19,830 --> 04:20:19,840
um I unscrubbed from the
 

12415
04:20:19,840 --> 04:20:22,070
um I unscrubbed from the
surgery after exposing the brain and

12416
04:20:22,070 --> 04:20:22,080
surgery after exposing the brain and
 

12417
04:20:22,080 --> 04:20:24,590
surgery after exposing the brain and
presenting it to the robot and

12418
04:20:24,590 --> 04:20:24,600
presenting it to the robot and
 

12419
04:20:24,600 --> 04:20:29,309
presenting it to the robot and
um place the targets on the robot uh

12420
04:20:29,309 --> 04:20:29,319
um place the targets on the robot uh
 

12421
04:20:29,319 --> 04:20:31,750
um place the targets on the robot uh
inter software interface that tells the

12422
04:20:31,750 --> 04:20:31,760
inter software interface that tells the
 

12423
04:20:31,760 --> 04:20:33,590
inter software interface that tells the
robot where it's going to insert each

12424
04:20:33,590 --> 04:20:33,600
robot where it's going to insert each
 

12425
04:20:33,600 --> 04:20:37,349
robot where it's going to insert each
thread that was done um with you know my

12426
04:20:37,349 --> 04:20:37,359
thread that was done um with you know my
 

12427
04:20:37,359 --> 04:20:38,870
thread that was done um with you know my
hand on the mouse for whatever that's

12428
04:20:38,870 --> 04:20:38,880
hand on the mouse for whatever that's
 

12429
04:20:38,880 --> 04:20:40,870
hand on the mouse for whatever that's
worth so you were the one placing the

12430
04:20:40,870 --> 04:20:40,880
worth so you were the one placing the
 

12431
04:20:40,880 --> 04:20:44,710
worth so you were the one placing the
targets yeah oh cool so like it you know

the the the
 

12435
04:20:46,319 --> 04:20:49,189
the the the
robot uh with a computer vision provides

12436
04:20:49,189 --> 04:20:49,199
robot uh with a computer vision provides
 

12437
04:20:49,199 --> 04:20:50,990
robot uh with a computer vision provides
a bunch of candidates and you kind of

12438
04:20:50,990 --> 04:20:51,000
a bunch of candidates and you kind of
 

12439
04:20:51,000 --> 04:20:54,630
a bunch of candidates and you kind of
finalize the decision right uh you know

12440
04:20:54,630 --> 04:20:54,640
finalize the decision right uh you know
 

12441
04:20:54,640 --> 04:20:56,429
finalize the decision right uh you know
they the the software Engineers are

12442
04:20:56,429 --> 04:20:56,439
they the the software Engineers are
 

12443
04:20:56,439 --> 04:20:58,870
they the the software Engineers are
amazing on this team and so they

12444
04:20:58,870 --> 04:20:58,880
amazing on this team and so they
 

12445
04:20:58,880 --> 04:21:01,550
amazing on this team and so they
actually provided an interface where you

12446
04:21:01,550 --> 04:21:01,560
actually provided an interface where you
 

12447
04:21:01,560 --> 04:21:04,349
actually provided an interface where you
can essentially use a lasso tool and

12448
04:21:04,349 --> 04:21:04,359
can essentially use a lasso tool and
 

12449
04:21:04,359 --> 04:21:07,469
can essentially use a lasso tool and
select a a prime area of brain real

12450
04:21:07,469 --> 04:21:07,479
select a a prime area of brain real
 

12451
04:21:07,479 --> 04:21:10,349
select a a prime area of brain real
estate and it will automatically avoid

12452
04:21:10,349 --> 04:21:10,359
estate and it will automatically avoid
 

12453
04:21:10,359 --> 04:21:13,030
estate and it will automatically avoid
the blood vessels in that region and

12454
04:21:13,030 --> 04:21:13,040
the blood vessels in that region and
 

12455
04:21:13,040 --> 04:21:14,630
the blood vessels in that region and
automatically place a bunch of targets

12456
04:21:14,630 --> 04:21:14,640
automatically place a bunch of targets
 

12457
04:21:14,640 --> 04:21:16,510
automatically place a bunch of targets
so you you know that

12458
04:21:16,510 --> 04:21:16,520
so you you know that
 

12459
04:21:16,520 --> 04:21:19,269
so you you know that
allows you know the human robot operator

12460
04:21:19,269 --> 04:21:19,279
allows you know the human robot operator
 

12461
04:21:19,279 --> 04:21:22,710
allows you know the human robot operator
to select uh really good areas of brain

12462
04:21:22,710 --> 04:21:22,720
to select uh really good areas of brain
 

12463
04:21:22,720 --> 04:21:26,229
to select uh really good areas of brain
and make dense applications of Targets

12464
04:21:26,229 --> 04:21:26,239
and make dense applications of Targets
 

12465
04:21:26,239 --> 04:21:28,550
and make dense applications of Targets
in that in those regions the regions we

12466
04:21:28,550 --> 04:21:28,560
in that in those regions the regions we
 

12467
04:21:28,560 --> 04:21:32,590
in that in those regions the regions we
think are going to have the most um High

12468
04:21:32,590 --> 04:21:32,600
think are going to have the most um High
 

12469

12475
04:21:39,439 --> 04:21:41,830
intentions I've seen like images of this
and for me with OCD it's for some reason

12476
04:21:41,830 --> 04:21:41,840
and for me with OCD it's for some reason
 

12477
04:21:41,840 --> 04:21:44,590
and for me with OCD it's for some reason
a really doesn't uh I think there's a

04:21:44,590 --> 04:21:44,600
a really doesn't uh I think there's a
 

12479
04:21:44,600 --> 04:21:47,389
a really doesn't uh I think there's a
subreddit called oddly satisfying yeah

12480
04:21:47,389 --> 04:21:47,399
subreddit called oddly satisfying yeah
 

12481
04:21:47,399 --> 04:21:48,550
subreddit called oddly satisfying yeah
love that

12482
04:21:48,550 --> 04:21:48,560
love that
 

12483
04:21:48,560 --> 04:21:50,910
love that
subreddit It's oddly satisfying to see

12499
04:22:05,040 --> 04:22:06,670
reaction to the brain bleeding I can
tell you it's yes especially it's

12500
04:22:06,670 --> 04:22:06,680
tell you it's yes especially it's
 

12501

tell you it's yes especially it's
extremely satisfying watching the

12502
04:22:08,229 --> 04:22:08,239
extremely satisfying watching the

bleeding yeah
 

12509
04:22:13,319 --> 04:22:16,269
bleeding yeah
yeah so uh you said the feeling was of

12510
04:22:16,269 --> 04:22:16,279
yeah so uh you said the feeling was of
 

12511
04:22:16,279 --> 04:22:19,469
yeah so uh you said the feeling was of
relief when everything went perfectly

12512
04:22:19,469 --> 04:22:19,479
relief when everything went perfectly
 

12513
04:22:19,479 --> 04:22:22,950
relief when everything went perfectly
yeah how deep in the brain can you

12514
04:22:22,950 --> 04:22:22,960
yeah how deep in the brain can you
 

12515
04:22:22,960 --> 04:22:27,590
yeah how deep in the brain can you
currently go and uh eventually go let's

12516
04:22:27,590 --> 04:22:27,600
currently go and uh eventually go let's
 

12517
04:22:27,600 --> 04:22:30,670
currently go and uh eventually go let's
say on the neuralink side is it seems

12518
04:22:30,670 --> 04:22:30,680
say on the neuralink side is it seems
 

12519
04:22:30,680 --> 04:22:32,309
say on the neuralink side is it seems
the deeper you go in the brain the more

12520
04:22:32,309 --> 04:22:32,319
the deeper you go in the brain the more
 

12521
04:22:32,319 --> 04:22:33,710
the deeper you go in the brain the more
challenging it

12522
04:22:33,710 --> 04:22:33,720
challenging it
 

12523
04:22:33,720 --> 04:22:37,469
challenging it
becomes yeah so talking broadly about

12524
04:22:37,469 --> 04:22:37,479
becomes yeah so talking broadly about
 

12525
04:22:37,479 --> 04:22:39,349
becomes yeah so talking broadly about
neurosurgery we can get

12526
04:22:39,349 --> 04:22:39,359
neurosurgery we can get
 

12527
04:22:39,359 --> 04:22:42,070
neurosurgery we can get
anywhere uh it's routine for me to put

12528
04:22:42,070 --> 04:22:42,080
anywhere uh it's routine for me to put
 

12529
04:22:42,080 --> 04:22:44,030
anywhere uh it's routine for me to put
deeper brain stimulating

12530
04:22:44,030 --> 04:22:44,040
deeper brain stimulating
 

12531
04:22:44,040 --> 04:22:46,950
deeper brain stimulating
electrodes uh near the very bottom of

12532
04:22:46,950 --> 04:22:46,960
electrodes uh near the very bottom of
 

12533
04:22:46,960 --> 04:22:50,389
electrodes uh near the very bottom of
the brain uh entering from the top and

12534
04:22:50,389 --> 04:22:50,399
the brain uh entering from the top and
 

12535
04:22:50,399 --> 04:22:53,750
the brain uh entering from the top and
passing about a 2mm wire all the way

12536
04:22:53,750 --> 04:22:53,760
passing about a 2mm wire all the way
 

12537
04:22:53,760 --> 04:22:56,510
passing about a 2mm wire all the way
into the bottom of the brain and that's

12538
04:22:56,510 --> 04:22:56,520
into the bottom of the brain and that's
 

12539
04:22:56,520 --> 04:22:58,349
into the bottom of the brain and that's
not revolutionary a lot of people do

12540
04:22:58,349 --> 04:22:58,359
not revolutionary a lot of people do
 

12541
04:22:58,359 --> 04:23:00,750
not revolutionary a lot of people do
that uh and we can do that with very

12542
04:23:00,750 --> 04:23:00,760
that uh and we can do that with very
 

12543
04:23:00,760 --> 04:23:03,750
that uh and we can do that with very
high Precision I I use a robot uh from

12544
04:23:03,750 --> 04:23:03,760
high Precision I I use a robot uh from
 

12545
04:23:03,760 --> 04:23:08,630
high Precision I I use a robot uh from
Globus to do that surgery um you know

12546
04:23:08,630 --> 04:23:08,640
Globus to do that surgery um you know
 

12547
04:23:08,640 --> 04:23:10,990
Globus to do that surgery um you know
several times a month uh it's it's

12548
04:23:10,990 --> 04:23:11,000
several times a month uh it's it's
 

12549
04:23:11,000 --> 04:23:13,550
several times a month uh it's it's
pretty routine what are your eyes in

12550
04:23:13,550 --> 04:23:13,560
pretty routine what are your eyes in
 

12551
04:23:13,560 --> 04:23:15,710
pretty routine what are your eyes in
that situation what what are you seeing

12552
04:23:15,710 --> 04:23:15,720
that situation what what are you seeing
 

12553
04:23:15,720 --> 04:23:17,590
that situation what what are you seeing
what's what kind of Technology can you

12554
04:23:17,590 --> 04:23:17,600
what's what kind of Technology can you
 

12555
04:23:17,600 --> 04:23:19,910
what's what kind of Technology can you
use to visualize where you are to light

12556
04:23:19,910 --> 04:23:19,920
use to visualize where you are to light
 

12557
04:23:19,920 --> 04:23:23,429
use to visualize where you are to light
your way yeah so it's a cool process on

12558
04:23:23,429 --> 04:23:23,439
your way yeah so it's a cool process on
 

12559
04:23:23,439 --> 04:23:24,870
your way yeah so it's a cool process on
the software side you take a

12560
04:23:24,870 --> 04:23:24,880
the software side you take a
 

12561
04:23:24,880 --> 04:23:27,229
the software side you take a
pre-operative MRI that's extremely high

12562
04:23:27,229 --> 04:23:27,239
pre-operative MRI that's extremely high
 

12563
04:23:27,239 --> 04:23:31,469
pre-operative MRI that's extremely high
resolution data of the entire brain you

12564
04:23:31,469 --> 04:23:31,479
resolution data of the entire brain you
 

12565
04:23:31,479 --> 04:23:33,790
resolution data of the entire brain you
put the patient to sleep put their head

12566
04:23:33,790 --> 04:23:33,800
put the patient to sleep put their head
 

12567
04:23:33,800 --> 04:23:36,389
put the patient to sleep put their head
in a frame that holds the skull very

12568
04:23:36,389 --> 04:23:36,399
in a frame that holds the skull very
 

12569
04:23:36,399 --> 04:23:40,149
in a frame that holds the skull very
rigidly and then you take a CT scan of

12570
04:23:40,149 --> 04:23:40,159
rigidly and then you take a CT scan of
 

12571
04:23:40,159 --> 04:23:41,389
rigidly and then you take a CT scan of
their head while they're asleep with

12572
04:23:41,389 --> 04:23:41,399
their head while they're asleep with
 

12573
04:23:41,399 --> 04:23:42,990
their head while they're asleep with
that frame on

12574
04:23:42,990 --> 04:23:43,000
that frame on
 

12575
04:23:43,000 --> 04:23:46,630
that frame on
and then merge uh the MRI and the CT in

12576
04:23:46,630 --> 04:23:46,640
and then merge uh the MRI and the CT in
 

12577
04:23:46,640 --> 04:23:49,830
and then merge uh the MRI and the CT in
software you have a a plan based on the

12578
04:23:49,830 --> 04:23:49,840
software you have a a plan based on the
 

12579
04:23:49,840 --> 04:23:52,349
software you have a a plan based on the
MRI where you can see these nuclei deep

12580
04:23:52,349 --> 04:23:52,359
MRI where you can see these nuclei deep
 

12581
04:23:52,359 --> 04:23:55,109
MRI where you can see these nuclei deep
in the brain you can't see them on CT

12582
04:23:55,109 --> 04:23:55,119
in the brain you can't see them on CT
 

12583
04:23:55,119 --> 04:23:58,830
in the brain you can't see them on CT
but if you trust the merging of the two

12584
04:23:58,830 --> 04:23:58,840
but if you trust the merging of the two
 

12585
04:23:58,840 --> 04:24:01,349
but if you trust the merging of the two
images then you indirectly know on the

12586
04:24:01,349 --> 04:24:01,359
images then you indirectly know on the
 

12587
04:24:01,359 --> 04:24:04,229
images then you indirectly know on the
CT where that is and therefore

12588
04:24:04,229 --> 04:24:04,239
CT where that is and therefore
 

12589
04:24:04,239 --> 04:24:07,149
CT where that is and therefore
indirectly know where in reference to

deep Targets in the brain it's

12706
04:26:46,429 --> 04:26:46,439
deep Targets in the brain it's
 

12707
04:26:46,439 --> 04:26:47,510
deep Targets in the brain it's
interesting because like you have to

12708
04:26:47,510 --> 04:26:47,520
interesting because like you have to
 

12709
04:26:47,520 --> 04:26:50,429
interesting because like you have to
avoid blood vessels somehow you have to

12710
04:26:50,429 --> 04:26:50,439
avoid blood vessels somehow you have to
 

12711
04:26:50,439 --> 04:26:51,950
avoid blood vessels somehow you have to
maybe there's creative ways of doing the

12712
04:26:51,950 --> 04:26:51,960
maybe there's creative ways of doing the
 

12713
04:26:51,960 --> 04:26:53,510
maybe there's creative ways of doing the
same thing like mapping out high

12714
04:26:53,510 --> 04:26:53,520
same thing like mapping out high
 

12715
04:26:53,520 --> 04:26:55,830
same thing like mapping out high
resolution geometry of blood vessels and

12716
04:26:55,830 --> 04:26:55,840
resolution geometry of blood vessels and
 

12717
04:26:55,840 --> 04:26:57,990
resolution geometry of blood vessels and
then you can go in

12718
04:26:57,990 --> 04:26:58,000
then you can go in
 

12719
04:26:58,000 --> 04:27:00,870
then you can go in
blind but like how do you map out that

12720
04:27:00,870 --> 04:27:00,880
blind but like how do you map out that
 

12721
04:27:00,880 --> 04:27:03,309
blind but like how do you map out that
in a way that's like super stable it's

12722
04:27:03,309 --> 04:27:03,319
in a way that's like super stable it's
 

12723
04:27:03,319 --> 04:27:04,550
in a way that's like super stable it's
there's a lot of interesting challenges

12724
04:27:04,550 --> 04:27:04,560
there's a lot of interesting challenges
 

12725
04:27:04,560 --> 04:27:06,710
there's a lot of interesting challenges
there right yeah but there's a lot to do

12726
04:27:06,710 --> 04:27:06,720
there right yeah but there's a lot to do
 

12727
04:27:06,720 --> 04:27:09,189
there right yeah but there's a lot to do
on the surface Lu exactly so we've got

12728
04:27:09,189 --> 04:27:09,199
on the surface Lu exactly so we've got
 

12729
04:27:09,199 --> 04:27:12,510
on the surface Lu exactly so we've got
Vision on the surface um you know we we

actually have made a huge amount of
 

12733
04:27:14,199 --> 04:27:15,349
actually have made a huge amount of

04:27:29,920 --> 04:27:33,670
intentions to a spine mounted implant
that can affect muscle contractions in

12746
04:27:33,670 --> 04:27:33,680
that can affect muscle contractions in
 

12747
04:27:33,680 --> 04:27:36,189
that can affect muscle contractions in
previously paralyzed arms and legs

12748
04:27:36,189 --> 04:27:36,199
previously paralyzed arms and legs
 

12749
04:27:36,199 --> 04:27:37,710
previously paralyzed arms and legs
that's just incredible so like the

12750
04:27:37,710 --> 04:27:37,720
that's just incredible so like the
 

12751
04:27:37,720 --> 04:27:40,109
that's just incredible so like the
effort there is to try to bridge the

12752
04:27:40,109 --> 04:27:40,119
effort there is to try to bridge the
 

12753
04:27:40,119 --> 04:27:42,630
effort there is to try to bridge the
brain to the spinal cord to the

12754
04:27:42,630 --> 04:27:42,640
brain to the spinal cord to the
 

12755
04:27:42,640 --> 04:27:46,710
brain to the spinal cord to the
periphery peripheral nervous so uh how

12756
04:27:46,710 --> 04:27:46,720
periphery peripheral nervous so uh how
 

12757
04:27:46,720 --> 04:27:48,910
periphery peripheral nervous so uh how
hard is that to do we have that working

12758
04:27:48,910 --> 04:27:48,920
hard is that to do we have that working
 

12759
04:27:48,920 --> 04:27:52,830
hard is that to do we have that working
in uh in very crude forms in animals

12760
04:27:52,830 --> 04:27:52,840
in uh in very crude forms in animals
 

12761
04:27:52,840 --> 04:27:54,469
in uh in very crude forms in animals
that's amazing yeah we've done it so

12762
04:27:54,469 --> 04:27:54,479
that's amazing yeah we've done it so
 

12763
04:27:54,479 --> 04:27:56,389
that's amazing yeah we've done it so
similar to like with Nolan where he's

12764
04:27:56,389 --> 04:27:56,399
similar to like with Nolan where he's
 

12765
04:27:56,399 --> 04:27:59,910
similar to like with Nolan where he's
able to digitally move the cursor here

12766
04:27:59,910 --> 04:27:59,920
able to digitally move the cursor here
 

12767
04:27:59,920 --> 04:28:00,950
able to digitally move the cursor here
you're

12768
04:28:00,950 --> 04:28:00,960
you're
 

12769
04:28:00,960 --> 04:28:03,710
you're
doing uh the same kind of communication

12770
04:28:03,710 --> 04:28:03,720
doing uh the same kind of communication
 

12771
04:28:03,720 --> 04:28:05,950
doing uh the same kind of communication
but with the actual defectors that you

12772
04:28:05,950 --> 04:28:05,960
but with the actual defectors that you
 

12773
04:28:05,960 --> 04:28:09,349
but with the actual defectors that you
have yeah that's fascinating yeah so we

12774
04:28:09,349 --> 04:28:09,359
have yeah that's fascinating yeah so we
 

12775
04:28:09,359 --> 04:28:13,910
have yeah that's fascinating yeah so we
have anesthetized animals doing grasp

12776
04:28:13,910 --> 04:28:13,920
have anesthetized animals doing grasp
 

12777
04:28:13,920 --> 04:28:16,389
have anesthetized animals doing grasp
and moving moving their legs and an sort

12778
04:28:16,389 --> 04:28:16,399
and moving moving their legs and an sort
 

12779
04:28:16,399 --> 04:28:20,429
and moving moving their legs and an sort
of walking pattern uh again early days

12780
04:28:20,429 --> 04:28:20,439
of walking pattern uh again early days
 

12781
04:28:20,439 --> 04:28:23,149
of walking pattern uh again early days
uh but uh the future is bright for this

12782
04:28:23,149 --> 04:28:23,159
uh but uh the future is bright for this
 

12783
04:28:23,159 --> 04:28:25,309
uh but uh the future is bright for this
kind of thing and and people with

12784
04:28:25,309 --> 04:28:25,319
kind of thing and and people with
 

12785
04:28:25,319 --> 04:28:28,109
kind of thing and and people with
paralysis uh should look forward to that

12786
04:28:28,109 --> 04:28:28,119
paralysis uh should look forward to that
 

12787
04:28:28,119 --> 04:28:29,389
paralysis uh should look forward to that
bright future they're going to have

12788
04:28:29,389 --> 04:28:29,399
bright future they're going to have
 

12789
04:28:29,399 --> 04:28:31,630
bright future they're going to have
options yeah and there's a lot of sort

12790
04:28:31,630 --> 04:28:31,640
options yeah and there's a lot of sort
 

12791
04:28:31,640 --> 04:28:35,149
options yeah and there's a lot of sort
of uh intermediate or extra options

12792
04:28:35,149 --> 04:28:35,159
of uh intermediate or extra options
 

12793
04:28:35,159 --> 04:28:37,389
of uh intermediate or extra options
where you take like an Optimus robot

12794
04:28:37,389 --> 04:28:37,399
where you take like an Optimus robot
 

12795
04:28:37,399 --> 04:28:40,790
where you take like an Optimus robot
like the uh the arm and to be able to

12796
04:28:40,790 --> 04:28:40,800
like the uh the arm and to be able to
 

12797
04:28:40,800 --> 04:28:43,870
like the uh the arm and to be able to
control the arm yeah the the the fingers

12798
04:28:43,870 --> 04:28:43,880
control the arm yeah the the the fingers
 

12799
04:28:43,880 --> 04:28:47,590
control the arm yeah the the the fingers
the hands of the arm sure as a

12800
04:28:47,590 --> 04:28:47,600
the hands of the arm sure as a
 

12801
04:28:47,600 --> 04:28:51,109
the hands of the arm sure as a
prosthetic are getting better too

12802
04:28:51,109 --> 04:28:51,119
prosthetic are getting better too
 

12803
04:28:51,119 --> 04:28:53,630
prosthetic are getting better too
exoskeletons yeah so that that goes hand

12804
04:28:53,630 --> 04:28:53,640
exoskeletons yeah so that that goes hand
 

12805
04:28:53,640 --> 04:28:55,750
exoskeletons yeah so that that goes hand
in hand although I didn't quite

12806
04:28:55,750 --> 04:28:55,760
in hand although I didn't quite
 

12807
04:28:55,760 --> 04:28:57,670
in hand although I didn't quite
understand until thinking about a deep

12808
04:28:57,670 --> 04:28:57,680
understand until thinking about a deep
 

12809
04:28:57,680 --> 04:28:59,349
understand until thinking about a deep
doing more research about

12810
04:28:59,349 --> 04:28:59,359
doing more research about
 

12811
04:28:59,359 --> 04:29:01,790
doing more research about
neuralink how much you can do on the

12812
04:29:01,790 --> 04:29:01,800
neuralink how much you can do on the
 

12813
04:29:01,800 --> 04:29:04,910
neuralink how much you can do on the
digital side so this digital telepathy

12814
04:29:04,910 --> 04:29:04,920
digital side so this digital telepathy
 

12815
04:29:04,920 --> 04:29:07,189
digital side so this digital telepathy
yeah I I didn't quite understand that

12816
04:29:07,189 --> 04:29:07,199
yeah I I didn't quite understand that
 

12817
04:29:07,199 --> 04:29:10,550
yeah I I didn't quite understand that
you can really map the

12818
04:29:10,550 --> 04:29:10,560
you can really map the
 

12819
04:29:10,560 --> 04:29:13,950
you can really map the
intention as you described in the hand

12820
04:29:13,950 --> 04:29:13,960
intention as you described in the hand
 

12821
04:29:13,960 --> 04:29:17,670
intention as you described in the hand
knob area that you can map the intention

12822
04:29:17,670 --> 04:29:17,680
knob area that you can map the intention
 

12823
04:29:17,680 --> 04:29:20,870
knob area that you can map the intention
just imagine it think about it that

12824
04:29:20,870 --> 04:29:20,880
just imagine it think about it that
 

12825
04:29:20,880 --> 04:29:23,030
just imagine it think about it that
intention can be mapped to actual action

12826
04:29:23,030 --> 04:29:23,040
intention can be mapped to actual action
 

12827
04:29:23,040 --> 04:29:24,990
intention can be mapped to actual action
in the digital world right and now more

12828
04:29:24,990 --> 04:29:25,000
in the digital world right and now more
 

12829
04:29:25,000 --> 04:29:27,030
in the digital world right and now more
and more so much can be done in in the

12830
04:29:27,030 --> 04:29:27,040
and more so much can be done in in the
 

12831
04:29:27,040 --> 04:29:30,030
and more so much can be done in in the
digital world that it it it can

12832
04:29:30,030 --> 04:29:30,040
digital world that it it it can
 

12833
04:29:30,040 --> 04:29:32,389
digital world that it it it can
reconnect you to to the outside world it

12834
04:29:32,389 --> 04:29:32,399
reconnect you to to the outside world it
 

12835
04:29:32,399 --> 04:29:34,990
reconnect you to to the outside world it
can allow you to have freedom have

12836
04:29:34,990 --> 04:29:35,000
can allow you to have freedom have
 

12837
04:29:35,000 --> 04:29:37,670
can allow you to have freedom have
Independence if you're a quadriplegic

12838
04:29:37,670 --> 04:29:37,680
Independence if you're a quadriplegic
 

12839
04:29:37,680 --> 04:29:39,149
Independence if you're a quadriplegic
yeah that's really powerful like you can

12840
04:29:39,149 --> 04:29:39,159
yeah that's really powerful like you can
 

12841
04:29:39,159 --> 04:29:41,750
yeah that's really powerful like you can
go really far with that yeah our first

12842
04:29:41,750 --> 04:29:41,760
go really far with that yeah our first
 

12843
04:29:41,760 --> 04:29:45,070
go really far with that yeah our first
part participant is he's incredible he's

12844
04:29:45,070 --> 04:29:45,080
part participant is he's incredible he's
 

12845

and he's having fun with it it's great
um just going back to the surgery your

12850
04:29:53,630 --> 04:29:53,640
um just going back to the surgery your
 

12851

like you're doing surgery all the time
yeah maybe the ridiculous question what

12860
04:30:02,670 --> 04:30:02,680
yeah maybe the ridiculous question what
 

12861
04:30:02,680 --> 04:30:04,950
yeah maybe the ridiculous question what
does it take to get good at surgery

12862
04:30:04,950 --> 04:30:04,960
does it take to get good at surgery
 

12863
04:30:04,960 --> 04:30:07,550
does it take to get good at surgery

04:30:53,990 --> 04:30:54,000
you're not a sociopath I think your
 

12899
04:30:54,000 --> 04:30:56,389
you're not a sociopath I think your
patients bring that with them to the

12900
04:30:56,389 --> 04:30:56,399
patients bring that with them to the
 

12901
04:30:56,399 --> 04:30:59,349
patients bring that with them to the
office visits every day they you know

12902
04:30:59,349 --> 04:30:59,359
office visits every day they you know
 

12903
04:30:59,359 --> 04:31:01,070
office visits every day they you know
force you to want to do better all the

12904
04:31:01,070 --> 04:31:01,080
force you to want to do better all the
 

12905
04:31:01,080 --> 04:31:03,590
force you to want to do better all the
time yeah just step up I mean it's a

12906
04:31:03,590 --> 04:31:03,600
time yeah just step up I mean it's a
 

12907
04:31:03,600 --> 04:31:06,189
time yeah just step up I mean it's a
real human being a real human being that

12908
04:31:06,189 --> 04:31:06,199
real human being a real human being that
 

12909
04:31:06,199 --> 04:31:09,469
real human being a real human being that
you can help yeah so every surgery even

12910
04:31:09,469 --> 04:31:09,479
you can help yeah so every surgery even
 

12911
04:31:09,479 --> 04:31:11,990
you can help yeah so every surgery even
if it's the same exact surgery is there

12912
04:31:11,990 --> 04:31:12,000
if it's the same exact surgery is there
 

12913
04:31:12,000 --> 04:31:13,309
if it's the same exact surgery is there
a lot of variability between that

12914
04:31:13,309 --> 04:31:13,319
a lot of variability between that
 

12915
04:31:13,319 --> 04:31:15,590
a lot of variability between that
surging and a different person yeah a

12916
04:31:15,590 --> 04:31:15,600
surging and a different person yeah a
 

12917
04:31:15,600 --> 04:31:19,670
surging and a different person yeah a
fair bit I mean a good example for us is

12918
04:31:19,670 --> 04:31:19,680
fair bit I mean a good example for us is
 

12919
04:31:19,680 --> 04:31:22,510
fair bit I mean a good example for us is
that the angle of the skull relative to

12920
04:31:22,510 --> 04:31:22,520
that the angle of the skull relative to
 

12921
04:31:22,520 --> 04:31:25,670
that the angle of the skull relative to
the normal plane of the body

12922
04:31:25,670 --> 04:31:25,680
the normal plane of the body
 

12923
04:31:25,680 --> 04:31:29,590
the normal plane of the body
axis of the skull over hand knob uh is

12924
04:31:29,590 --> 04:31:29,600
axis of the skull over hand knob uh is
 

12925
04:31:29,600 --> 04:31:32,469
axis of the skull over hand knob uh is
pretty wide variation I mean some people

12926
04:31:32,469 --> 04:31:32,479
pretty wide variation I mean some people
 

12927
04:31:32,479 --> 04:31:35,469
pretty wide variation I mean some people
have really flat skulls and some people

12928
04:31:35,469 --> 04:31:35,479
have really flat skulls and some people
 

12929
04:31:35,479 --> 04:31:37,790
have really flat skulls and some people
have really steeply angled skulls over

12930
04:31:37,790 --> 04:31:37,800
have really steeply angled skulls over
 

12931
04:31:37,800 --> 04:31:40,870
have really steeply angled skulls over
that area and that has you know

12932
04:31:40,870 --> 04:31:40,880
that area and that has you know
 

12933
04:31:40,880 --> 04:31:43,670
that area and that has you know
consequences for or how their head can

12934
04:31:43,670 --> 04:31:43,680
consequences for or how their head can
 

12935
04:31:43,680 --> 04:31:46,870
consequences for or how their head can
be fixed in in uh in sort of the frame

12936
04:31:46,870 --> 04:31:46,880
be fixed in in uh in sort of the frame
 

12937
04:31:46,880 --> 04:31:49,910
be fixed in in uh in sort of the frame
that we use um and how the robot has to

12938
04:31:49,910 --> 04:31:49,920
that we use um and how the robot has to
 

12939
04:31:49,920 --> 04:31:54,389
that we use um and how the robot has to
approach the skull and um yeah people's

12940
04:31:54,389 --> 04:31:54,399
approach the skull and um yeah people's
 

12941
04:31:54,399 --> 04:31:56,269
approach the skull and um yeah people's
people's bodies are built as differently

12942
04:31:56,269 --> 04:31:56,279
people's bodies are built as differently
 

12943
04:31:56,279 --> 04:31:58,510
people's bodies are built as differently
as you know the people you see walking

12944
04:31:58,510 --> 04:31:58,520
as you know the people you see walking
 

12945
04:31:58,520 --> 04:32:00,750
as you know the people you see walking
down the street as as much variability

12946
04:32:00,750 --> 04:32:00,760
down the street as as much variability
 

12947
04:32:00,760 --> 04:32:03,469
down the street as as much variability
in body shape and size as you see there

12948
04:32:03,469 --> 04:32:03,479
in body shape and size as you see there
 

12949
04:32:03,479 --> 04:32:06,309
in body shape and size as you see there
we see in brain anatomy and skull

12950
04:32:06,309 --> 04:32:06,319
we see in brain anatomy and skull
 

12951
04:32:06,319 --> 04:32:09,309
we see in brain anatomy and skull
Anatomy um there are some people who

12952
04:32:09,309 --> 04:32:09,319
Anatomy um there are some people who
 

12953
04:32:09,319 --> 04:32:11,910
Anatomy um there are some people who
we've had to kind of exclude from our

12954
04:32:11,910 --> 04:32:11,920
we've had to kind of exclude from our
 

12955
04:32:11,920 --> 04:32:14,149
we've had to kind of exclude from our
trial for having skulls that are too

12956
04:32:14,149 --> 04:32:14,159
trial for having skulls that are too
 

12957
04:32:14,159 --> 04:32:16,429
trial for having skulls that are too
thick or too thin or scalp that's too

12958
04:32:16,429 --> 04:32:16,439
thick or too thin or scalp that's too
 

12959
04:32:16,439 --> 04:32:19,990
thick or too thin or scalp that's too
thick or too thin um I think you know we

12960
04:32:19,990 --> 04:32:20,000
thick or too thin um I think you know we
 

12961
04:32:20,000 --> 04:32:23,950
thick or too thin um I think you know we
have like the middle 97% or so uh of

12962
04:32:23,950 --> 04:32:23,960
have like the middle 97% or so uh of
 

12963
04:32:23,960 --> 04:32:27,510
have like the middle 97% or so uh of
people but you can't account for all

12964
04:32:27,510 --> 04:32:27,520
people but you can't account for all
 

12965
04:32:27,520 --> 04:32:30,389
people but you can't account for all
human anatomy variability how

12966
04:32:30,389 --> 04:32:30,399
human anatomy variability how
 

12967
04:32:30,399 --> 04:32:34,030
human anatomy variability how
much like mushiness and mess is there CU

12968
04:32:34,030 --> 04:32:34,040
much like mushiness and mess is there CU
 

12969
04:32:34,040 --> 04:32:36,550
much like mushiness and mess is there CU
I uh you know taking biology classes the

12970
04:32:36,550 --> 04:32:36,560
I uh you know taking biology classes the
 

12971
04:32:36,560 --> 04:32:38,630
I uh you know taking biology classes the
diagrams are always really clean and

12972
04:32:38,630 --> 04:32:38,640
diagrams are always really clean and
 

12973
04:32:38,640 --> 04:32:41,189
diagrams are always really clean and
crisp Neuroscience the pictures of

12974
04:32:41,189 --> 04:32:41,199
crisp Neuroscience the pictures of
 

12975
04:32:41,199 --> 04:32:43,590
crisp Neuroscience the pictures of
neurons are always was really nice and

12976
04:32:43,590 --> 04:32:43,600
neurons are always was really nice and
 

12977
04:32:43,600 --> 04:32:46,630
neurons are always was really nice and
very um but whenever I look at pictures

12978
04:32:46,630 --> 04:32:46,640
very um but whenever I look at pictures
 

12979
04:32:46,640 --> 04:32:50,309
very um but whenever I look at pictures
of like real brains they're all I I

12980
04:32:50,309 --> 04:32:50,319
of like real brains they're all I I
 

12981
04:32:50,319 --> 04:32:52,710
of like real brains they're all I I
don't know what is going on yeah uh so

12982
04:32:52,710 --> 04:32:52,720
don't know what is going on yeah uh so
 

12983
04:32:52,720 --> 04:32:54,910
don't know what is going on yeah uh so
how much our biological systems in

12984
04:32:54,910 --> 04:32:54,920
how much our biological systems in
 

12985
04:32:54,920 --> 04:32:57,550
how much our biological systems in
reality like how hard is it to figure

12986
04:32:57,550 --> 04:32:57,560
reality like how hard is it to figure
 

12987
04:32:57,560 --> 04:33:00,510
reality like how hard is it to figure
out what's going on not too bad uh once

12988
04:33:00,510 --> 04:33:00,520
out what's going on not too bad uh once
 

12989
04:33:00,520 --> 04:33:03,429
out what's going on not too bad uh once
you really get used to this you know

12990
04:33:03,429 --> 04:33:03,439
you really get used to this you know
 

12991
04:33:03,439 --> 04:33:06,109
you really get used to this you know
that's where experience and and skill

12992
04:33:06,109 --> 04:33:06,119
that's where experience and and skill
 

12993
04:33:06,119 --> 04:33:09,269
that's where experience and and skill
and uh education really come into play

12994
04:33:09,269 --> 04:33:09,279
and uh education really come into play
 

12995
04:33:09,279 --> 04:33:13,551
and uh education really come into play
is if you stare at a thousand brains

12996
04:33:13,551 --> 04:33:13,561
is if you stare at a thousand brains
 

12997
04:33:13,561 --> 04:33:15,590
is if you stare at a thousand brains
it becomes easier to kind of mentally

12998
04:33:15,590 --> 04:33:15,600
it becomes easier to kind of mentally
 

12999
04:33:15,600 --> 04:33:19,029
it becomes easier to kind of mentally
peel back the say for instance blood

13000
04:33:19,029 --> 04:33:19,039
peel back the say for instance blood
 

13001
04:33:19,039 --> 04:33:21,949
peel back the say for instance blood
vessels that are obscuring the susai and

13002
04:33:21,949 --> 04:33:21,959
vessels that are obscuring the susai and
 

13003
04:33:21,959 --> 04:33:23,990
vessels that are obscuring the susai and
gyri you know kind of the wrinkle

13004
04:33:23,990 --> 04:33:24,000
gyri you know kind of the wrinkle
 

13005
04:33:24,000 --> 04:33:26,390
gyri you know kind of the wrinkle
pattern of the surface of the brain

13006
04:33:26,390 --> 04:33:26,400
pattern of the surface of the brain
 

13007
04:33:26,400 --> 04:33:27,551
pattern of the surface of the brain
occasionally when you're when you're

13008
04:33:27,551 --> 04:33:27,561
occasionally when you're when you're
 

13009
04:33:27,561 --> 04:33:29,150
occasionally when you're when you're
first starting to do this and you open

13010
04:33:29,150 --> 04:33:29,160
first starting to do this and you open
 

13011
04:33:29,160 --> 04:33:30,230
first starting to do this and you open
the

13012
04:33:30,230 --> 04:33:30,240
the
 

13013
04:33:30,240 --> 04:33:32,910
the
skull it doesn't match what you thought

13014
04:33:32,910 --> 04:33:32,920
skull it doesn't match what you thought
 

13015
04:33:32,920 --> 04:33:36,109
skull it doesn't match what you thought
you were going to see based on the

13016
04:33:36,109 --> 04:33:36,119
you were going to see based on the
 

13017
04:33:36,119 --> 04:33:39,990
you were going to see based on the
MRI uh and with more experience you you

13018
04:33:39,990 --> 04:33:40,000
MRI uh and with more experience you you
 

13019
04:33:40,000 --> 04:33:43,310
MRI uh and with more experience you you
learn to kind of peel back that layer of

13020
04:33:43,310 --> 04:33:43,320
learn to kind of peel back that layer of
 

13021
04:33:43,320 --> 04:33:46,429
learn to kind of peel back that layer of
blood vessels and see the underlying

13022
04:33:46,429 --> 04:33:46,439
blood vessels and see the underlying
 

13023
04:33:46,439 --> 04:33:49,269
blood vessels and see the underlying
pattern of wrinkles in the brain and use

13024
04:33:49,269 --> 04:33:49,279
pattern of wrinkles in the brain and use
 

13025
04:33:49,279 --> 04:33:51,750
pattern of wrinkles in the brain and use
that as a landmark for where you are the

13026
04:33:51,750 --> 04:33:51,760
that as a landmark for where you are the
 

13027
04:33:51,760 --> 04:33:54,670
that as a landmark for where you are the
wrinkles are a landmark so like yeah so

13028
04:33:54,670 --> 04:33:54,680
wrinkles are a landmark so like yeah so
 

13029
04:33:54,680 --> 04:33:56,429
wrinkles are a landmark so like yeah so
I was describing hand knob earlier

13030
04:33:56,429 --> 04:33:56,439
I was describing hand knob earlier
 

13031
04:33:56,439 --> 04:33:58,230
I was describing hand knob earlier
that's a pattern of the wrinkles in the

13032
04:33:58,230 --> 04:33:58,240
that's a pattern of the wrinkles in the
 

13033
04:33:58,240 --> 04:34:00,429
that's a pattern of the wrinkles in the
brain it's sort of this sort of Greek

13034
04:34:00,429 --> 04:34:00,439
brain it's sort of this sort of Greek
 

13035
04:34:00,439 --> 04:34:04,269
brain it's sort of this sort of Greek
letter Omega shaped area of the brain so

13036
04:34:04,269 --> 04:34:04,279
letter Omega shaped area of the brain so
 

13037
04:34:04,279 --> 04:34:06,390
letter Omega shaped area of the brain so
you could recognize the hand knob area

13038
04:34:06,390 --> 04:34:06,400
you could recognize the hand knob area
 

13039
04:34:06,400 --> 04:34:09,390
you could recognize the hand knob area
like if if I show you a thousand brains

13040
04:34:09,390 --> 04:34:09,400
like if if I show you a thousand brains
 

13041
04:34:09,400 --> 04:34:11,029
like if if I show you a thousand brains
and give you like one minute with each

13042
04:34:11,029 --> 04:34:11,039
and give you like one minute with each
 

13043
04:34:11,039 --> 04:34:13,510
and give you like one minute with each
you'd be like yep that's that sure and

13044
04:34:13,510 --> 04:34:13,520
you'd be like yep that's that sure and
 

13045
04:34:13,520 --> 04:34:15,629
you'd be like yep that's that sure and
so there is some uniqueness to that area

13046
04:34:15,629 --> 04:34:15,639
so there is some uniqueness to that area
 

13047
04:34:15,639 --> 04:34:17,990
so there is some uniqueness to that area
of the brain like in terms of the

13048
04:34:17,990 --> 04:34:18,000
of the brain like in terms of the
 

13049
04:34:18,000 --> 04:34:20,830
of the brain like in terms of the
geometry the topology of the thing

13050
04:34:20,830 --> 04:34:20,840
geometry the topology of the thing
 

13051
04:34:20,840 --> 04:34:24,869
geometry the topology of the thing
yeah where is it about in the it's so

13052
04:34:24,869 --> 04:34:24,879
yeah where is it about in the it's so
 

13053
04:34:24,879 --> 04:34:26,510
yeah where is it about in the it's so
you have this strip of brain running

13054
04:34:26,510 --> 04:34:26,520
you have this strip of brain running
 

13055
04:34:26,520 --> 04:34:28,869
you have this strip of brain running
down the top called the primary motor

13056
04:34:28,869 --> 04:34:28,879
down the top called the primary motor
 

13057
04:34:28,879 --> 04:34:31,750
down the top called the primary motor
area and I'm sure you've seen this

13058
04:34:31,750 --> 04:34:31,760
area and I'm sure you've seen this
 

13059
04:34:31,760 --> 04:34:33,590
area and I'm sure you've seen this
picture of the homunculus laid over the

13060
04:34:33,590 --> 04:34:33,600
picture of the homunculus laid over the
 

13061
04:34:33,600 --> 04:34:35,510
picture of the homunculus laid over the
surface of the brain the weird little

13062
04:34:35,510 --> 04:34:35,520
surface of the brain the weird little
 

13063
04:34:35,520 --> 04:34:38,551
surface of the brain the weird little
guy with huge lips and giant

13064
04:34:38,551 --> 04:34:38,561
guy with huge lips and giant
 

13065
04:34:38,561 --> 04:34:42,029
guy with huge lips and giant
hands uh that guy sort of lay with his

13066
04:34:42,029 --> 04:34:42,039
hands uh that guy sort of lay with his
 

13067
04:34:42,039 --> 04:34:44,470
hands uh that guy sort of lay with his
legs uh up at the top of the brain and

13068
04:34:44,470 --> 04:34:44,480
legs uh up at the top of the brain and
 

13069
04:34:44,480 --> 04:34:48,150
legs uh up at the top of the brain and
and face arm uh areas farther down and

13070
04:34:48,150 --> 04:34:48,160
and face arm uh areas farther down and
 

13071
04:34:48,160 --> 04:34:51,510
and face arm uh areas farther down and
and then some kind of mouth lip tongue

13072
04:34:51,510 --> 04:34:51,520
and then some kind of mouth lip tongue
 

13073
04:34:51,520 --> 04:34:56,670
and then some kind of mouth lip tongue
areas uh farther down and so the hand is

13074
04:34:56,670 --> 04:34:56,680
areas uh farther down and so the hand is
 

13075
04:34:56,680 --> 04:34:58,789
areas uh farther down and so the hand is
right in there and then the areas that

13076
04:34:58,789 --> 04:34:58,799
right in there and then the areas that
 

13077
04:34:58,799 --> 04:35:00,670
right in there and then the areas that
control speech at least on the on the

13078
04:35:00,670 --> 04:35:00,680
control speech at least on the on the
 

13079
04:35:00,680 --> 04:35:02,830
control speech at least on the on the
left side of the brain in most people

13080
04:35:02,830 --> 04:35:02,840
left side of the brain in most people
 

13081
04:35:02,840 --> 04:35:07,510
left side of the brain in most people
are are just below that and so uh any

13082
04:35:07,510 --> 04:35:07,520
are are just below that and so uh any
 

13083
04:35:07,520 --> 04:35:09,949
are are just below that and so uh any
muscle that you voluntarily move in your

13084
04:35:09,949 --> 04:35:09,959
muscle that you voluntarily move in your
 

13085
04:35:09,959 --> 04:35:13,551
muscle that you voluntarily move in your
body um the vast majority of that

13086
04:35:13,551 --> 04:35:13,561
body um the vast majority of that
 

13087
04:35:13,561 --> 04:35:15,109
body um the vast majority of that
references that strip or those

13088
04:35:15,109 --> 04:35:15,119
references that strip or those
 

13089
04:35:15,119 --> 04:35:17,551
references that strip or those
intentions come from that strip of brain

13090
04:35:17,551 --> 04:35:17,561
intentions come from that strip of brain
 

13091
04:35:17,561 --> 04:35:20,830
intentions come from that strip of brain
and the the wrinkle uh for hand knob is

13092
04:35:20,830 --> 04:35:20,840
and the the wrinkle uh for hand knob is
 

13093
04:35:20,840 --> 04:35:23,629
and the the wrinkle uh for hand knob is
right in the middle of that and vision

13094
04:35:23,629 --> 04:35:23,639
right in the middle of that and vision
 

13095
04:35:23,639 --> 04:35:26,789
right in the middle of that and vision
is back here yep also on close to the

13096
04:35:26,789 --> 04:35:26,799
is back here yep also on close to the
 

13097
04:35:26,799 --> 04:35:29,310
is back here yep also on close to the
surface vision's a little deeper uh and

13098
04:35:29,310 --> 04:35:29,320
surface vision's a little deeper uh and
 

13099
04:35:29,320 --> 04:35:31,551
surface vision's a little deeper uh and
so you know this gets to your question

13100
04:35:31,551 --> 04:35:31,561
so you know this gets to your question
 

13101
04:35:31,561 --> 04:35:35,709
so you know this gets to your question
about how deep can you get um to do

13102
04:35:35,709 --> 04:35:35,719
about how deep can you get um to do
 

13103
04:35:35,719 --> 04:35:38,070
about how deep can you get um to do
Vision we can't just do the surface of

13104
04:35:38,070 --> 04:35:38,080
Vision we can't just do the surface of
 

13105
04:35:38,080 --> 04:35:40,869
Vision we can't just do the surface of
the brain we have to be able to go in uh

13106
04:35:40,869 --> 04:35:40,879
the brain we have to be able to go in uh
 

13107
04:35:40,879 --> 04:35:42,670
the brain we have to be able to go in uh
not not as as deep as we'd have to go

13108
04:35:42,670 --> 04:35:42,680
not not as as deep as we'd have to go
 

13109
04:35:42,680 --> 04:35:45,750
not not as as deep as we'd have to go
for DBS but maybe a centimeter deeper

13110
04:35:45,750 --> 04:35:45,760
for DBS but maybe a centimeter deeper
 

13111
04:35:45,760 --> 04:35:48,949
for DBS but maybe a centimeter deeper
than we're used to for hand

13112
04:35:48,949 --> 04:35:48,959
than we're used to for hand
 

13113
04:35:48,959 --> 04:35:51,629
than we're used to for hand
insertions uh and so that's you know

13114
04:35:51,629 --> 04:35:51,639
insertions uh and so that's you know
 

13115
04:35:51,639 --> 04:35:53,990
insertions uh and so that's you know
work in progress that's a a new set of

13116
04:35:53,990 --> 04:35:54,000
work in progress that's a a new set of
 

13117
04:35:54,000 --> 04:35:56,029
work in progress that's a a new set of
challenges to overcome by the way you

13118
04:35:56,029 --> 04:35:56,039
challenges to overcome by the way you
 

13119
04:35:56,039 --> 04:35:59,230
challenges to overcome by the way you
mentioned uh the Utah aray and I just

13120
04:35:59,230 --> 04:35:59,240
mentioned uh the Utah aray and I just
 

13121
04:35:59,240 --> 04:36:01,029
mentioned uh the Utah aray and I just
saw a picture of that and that thing

13122
04:36:01,029 --> 04:36:01,039
saw a picture of that and that thing
 

13123
04:36:01,039 --> 04:36:03,709
saw a picture of that and that thing
looks terrifying

13124
04:36:03,709 --> 04:36:03,719
looks terrifying
 

13125
04:36:03,719 --> 04:36:06,230
looks terrifying
yeah it's because of it's rigid and then

13126
04:36:06,230 --> 04:36:06,240
yeah it's because of it's rigid and then
 

13127
04:36:06,240 --> 04:36:08,551
yeah it's because of it's rigid and then
if you look at the threads they're

13128
04:36:08,551 --> 04:36:08,561
if you look at the threads they're
 

13129
04:36:08,561 --> 04:36:10,310
if you look at the threads they're
flexible what can you say that's

13130
04:36:10,310 --> 04:36:10,320
flexible what can you say that's
 

13131
04:36:10,320 --> 04:36:12,590
flexible what can you say that's
interesting to you about the flex

13132
04:36:12,590 --> 04:36:12,600
interesting to you about the flex
 

13133
04:36:12,600 --> 04:36:14,070
interesting to you about the flex
that kind of approach of the the

13134
04:36:14,070 --> 04:36:14,080
that kind of approach of the the
 

13135
04:36:14,080 --> 04:36:15,990
that kind of approach of the the
flexible threads to to deliver the

13136
04:36:15,990 --> 04:36:16,000
flexible threads to to deliver the
 

13137
04:36:16,000 --> 04:36:18,349
flexible threads to to deliver the
electrodes next to the neurons yeah I

13138
04:36:18,349 --> 04:36:18,359
electrodes next to the neurons yeah I
 

13139
04:36:18,359 --> 04:36:21,349
electrodes next to the neurons yeah I
mean the the goal there comes from

13140
04:36:21,349 --> 04:36:21,359
mean the the goal there comes from
 

13141
04:36:21,359 --> 04:36:22,910
mean the the goal there comes from
experience I mean we stand on the

13142
04:36:22,910 --> 04:36:22,920
experience I mean we stand on the
 

13143
04:36:22,920 --> 04:36:25,709
experience I mean we stand on the
shoulders of people that made Utah rays

13144
04:36:25,709 --> 04:36:25,719
shoulders of people that made Utah rays
 

13145
04:36:25,719 --> 04:36:28,150
shoulders of people that made Utah rays
and and used Utah Rays for decades

13146
04:36:28,150 --> 04:36:28,160
and and used Utah Rays for decades
 

13147
04:36:28,160 --> 04:36:29,949
and and used Utah Rays for decades
before we ever even came

13148
04:36:29,949 --> 04:36:29,959
before we ever even came
 

13149
04:36:29,959 --> 04:36:34,310
before we ever even came
along um neuralink arose partly this

13150
04:36:34,310 --> 04:36:34,320
along um neuralink arose partly this
 

13151
04:36:34,320 --> 04:36:36,189
along um neuralink arose partly this
approach to technology arose out of a

13152
04:36:36,189 --> 04:36:36,199
approach to technology arose out of a
 

13153
04:36:36,199 --> 04:36:38,070
approach to technology arose out of a
need

13154
04:36:38,070 --> 04:36:38,080
need
 

13155
04:36:38,080 --> 04:36:40,990
need
recognized after Utah Rays would fail

13156
04:36:40,990 --> 04:36:41,000
recognized after Utah Rays would fail
 

13157
04:36:41,000 --> 04:36:43,189
recognized after Utah Rays would fail
routinely

13158
04:36:43,189 --> 04:36:43,199
routinely
 

13159
04:36:43,199 --> 04:36:45,510
routinely
because the rigid electrodes those

13160
04:36:45,510 --> 04:36:45,520
because the rigid electrodes those
 

13161
04:36:45,520 --> 04:36:49,070
because the rigid electrodes those
spikes that are literally hammered using

13162
04:36:49,070 --> 04:36:49,080
spikes that are literally hammered using
 

13163
04:36:49,080 --> 04:36:52,310
spikes that are literally hammered using
an air hammer into the

13164
04:36:52,310 --> 04:36:52,320
an air hammer into the
 

13165
04:36:52,320 --> 04:36:55,590
an air hammer into the
brain uh those spikes generate a bad

13166
04:36:55,590 --> 04:36:55,600
brain uh those spikes generate a bad
 

13167
04:36:55,600 --> 04:36:58,029
brain uh those spikes generate a bad
immune response that

13168
04:36:58,029 --> 04:36:58,039
immune response that
 

13169
04:36:58,039 --> 04:37:01,590
immune response that
encapsulates the the electrode spikes in

13170
04:37:01,590 --> 04:37:01,600
encapsulates the the electrode spikes in
 

13171
04:37:01,600 --> 04:37:05,070
encapsulates the the electrode spikes in
uh Scar Tissue essentially and so one of

13172
04:37:05,070 --> 04:37:05,080
uh Scar Tissue essentially and so one of
 

13173
04:37:05,080 --> 04:37:07,070
uh Scar Tissue essentially and so one of
the projects that was being worked on in

13174
04:37:07,070 --> 04:37:07,080
the projects that was being worked on in
 

13175
04:37:07,080 --> 04:37:10,629
the projects that was being worked on in
in the Anderson Lab at Caltech when I

13176
04:37:10,629 --> 04:37:10,639
in the Anderson Lab at Caltech when I
 

13177
04:37:10,639 --> 04:37:12,709
in the Anderson Lab at Caltech when I
got there was to to see if you could use

13178
04:37:12,709 --> 04:37:12,719
got there was to to see if you could use
 

13179
04:37:12,719 --> 04:37:15,590
got there was to to see if you could use
chemo therapy to prevent the formation

13180
04:37:15,590 --> 04:37:15,600
chemo therapy to prevent the formation
 

13181
04:37:15,600 --> 04:37:18,390
chemo therapy to prevent the formation
of scar like you know things are pretty

13182
04:37:18,390 --> 04:37:18,400
of scar like you know things are pretty
 

13183
04:37:18,400 --> 04:37:20,230
of scar like you know things are pretty
bad when you're jamming a bed of nails

13184
04:37:20,230 --> 04:37:20,240
bad when you're jamming a bed of nails
 

13185
04:37:20,240 --> 04:37:24,189
bad when you're jamming a bed of nails
into the brain and then treating that

13186
04:37:24,189 --> 04:37:24,199
into the brain and then treating that
 

13187
04:37:24,199 --> 04:37:25,109
into the brain and then treating that
with

13188
04:37:25,109 --> 04:37:25,119
with
 

13189
04:37:25,119 --> 04:37:27,109
with
chemotherapy to try to prevent Scar

13190
04:37:27,109 --> 04:37:27,119
chemotherapy to try to prevent Scar
 

13191
04:37:27,119 --> 04:37:28,709
chemotherapy to try to prevent Scar
Tissue it's like you know maybe we've

13192
04:37:28,709 --> 04:37:28,719
Tissue it's like you know maybe we've
 

13193
04:37:28,719 --> 04:37:30,189
Tissue it's like you know maybe we've
gotten off track here guys maybe there's

13194
04:37:30,189 --> 04:37:30,199
gotten off track here guys maybe there's
 

13195
04:37:30,199 --> 04:37:33,551
gotten off track here guys maybe there's
a fundamental redesign necessary and so

13196
04:37:33,551 --> 04:37:33,561
a fundamental redesign necessary and so
 

13197
04:37:33,561 --> 04:37:35,709
a fundamental redesign necessary and so
nurl Link's approach of using highly

13198
04:37:35,709 --> 04:37:35,719
nurl Link's approach of using highly
 

13199
04:37:35,719 --> 04:37:38,510
nurl Link's approach of using highly
flexible tiny

13200
04:37:38,510 --> 04:37:38,520
flexible tiny
 

13201
04:37:38,520 --> 04:37:41,670
flexible tiny
electrodes avoids a lot of the bleeding

13202
04:37:41,670 --> 04:37:41,680
electrodes avoids a lot of the bleeding
 

13203
04:37:41,680 --> 04:37:43,510
electrodes avoids a lot of the bleeding
avoids a lot of the immune response that

13204
04:37:43,510 --> 04:37:43,520
avoids a lot of the immune response that
 

13205
04:37:43,520 --> 04:37:45,629
avoids a lot of the immune response that
ends up happening uh when rigid

13206
04:37:45,629 --> 04:37:45,639
ends up happening uh when rigid
 

13207
04:37:45,639 --> 04:37:47,949
ends up happening uh when rigid
electrodes are pounded into the brain

13208
04:37:47,949 --> 04:37:47,959
electrodes are pounded into the brain
 

13209
04:37:47,959 --> 04:37:50,750
electrodes are pounded into the brain
and so what we see is our electrode

13210
04:37:50,750 --> 04:37:50,760
and so what we see is our electrode
 

13211
04:37:50,760 --> 04:37:52,310
and so what we see is our electrode
longevity and

13212
04:37:52,310 --> 04:37:52,320
longevity and
 

13213
04:37:52,320 --> 04:37:54,349
longevity and
functionality uh and the and the health

13214
04:37:54,349 --> 04:37:54,359
functionality uh and the and the health
 

13215
04:37:54,359 --> 04:37:55,670
functionality uh and the and the health
of the brain tissue immediately

13216
04:37:55,670 --> 04:37:55,680
of the brain tissue immediately
 

13217
04:37:55,680 --> 04:37:58,551
of the brain tissue immediately
surrounding the electrode uh is

13218
04:37:58,551 --> 04:37:58,561
surrounding the electrode uh is
 

13219
04:37:58,561 --> 04:38:00,629
surrounding the electrode uh is
excellent I mean it goes on for for

13220
04:38:00,629 --> 04:38:00,639
excellent I mean it goes on for for
 

13221
04:38:00,639 --> 04:38:03,869
excellent I mean it goes on for for
years now in our animal models what do

13222
04:38:03,869 --> 04:38:03,879
years now in our animal models what do
 

13223
04:38:03,879 --> 04:38:05,470
years now in our animal models what do
most people not understand about the

13224
04:38:05,470 --> 04:38:05,480
most people not understand about the
 

13225
04:38:05,480 --> 04:38:08,230
most people not understand about the
biology of the brain we mention the

13226
04:38:08,230 --> 04:38:08,240
biology of the brain we mention the
 

13227
04:38:08,240 --> 04:38:10,310
biology of the brain we mention the
vasculature that's really interesting I

13228
04:38:10,310 --> 04:38:10,320
vasculature that's really interesting I
 

13229
04:38:10,320 --> 04:38:12,709
vasculature that's really interesting I
think the most interesting maybe

13230
04:38:12,709 --> 04:38:12,719
think the most interesting maybe
 

13231
04:38:12,719 --> 04:38:15,390
think the most interesting maybe
underappreciated

13232
04:38:15,390 --> 04:38:15,400
underappreciated
 

13233
04:38:15,400 --> 04:38:17,990
underappreciated
fact uh is that it really does control

13234
04:38:17,990 --> 04:38:18,000
fact uh is that it really does control
 

13235
04:38:18,000 --> 04:38:20,109
fact uh is that it really does control
almost everything I

13236
04:38:20,109 --> 04:38:20,119
almost everything I
 

13237
04:38:20,119 --> 04:38:22,750
almost everything I
mean I don't know for out of the blue

13238
04:38:22,750 --> 04:38:22,760
mean I don't know for out of the blue
 

13239
04:38:22,760 --> 04:38:25,189
mean I don't know for out of the blue
example imagine you you want a lever on

13240
04:38:25,189 --> 04:38:25,199
example imagine you you want a lever on
 

13241
04:38:25,199 --> 04:38:26,709
example imagine you you want a lever on
fertility you want to be able to turn

13242
04:38:26,709 --> 04:38:26,719
fertility you want to be able to turn
 

13243
04:38:26,719 --> 04:38:29,830
fertility you want to be able to turn
fertility on and off I mean it there are

13244
04:38:29,830 --> 04:38:29,840
fertility on and off I mean it there are
 

13245
04:38:29,840 --> 04:38:32,750
fertility on and off I mean it there are
legitimate Targets in the brain itself

13246
04:38:32,750 --> 04:38:32,760
legitimate Targets in the brain itself
 

13247
04:38:32,760 --> 04:38:34,070
legitimate Targets in the brain itself
to modulate

13248
04:38:34,070 --> 04:38:34,080
to modulate
 

13249
04:38:34,080 --> 04:38:38,349
to modulate
fertility say um blood pressure you want

13250
04:38:38,349 --> 04:38:38,359
fertility say um blood pressure you want
 

13251
04:38:38,359 --> 04:38:40,869
fertility say um blood pressure you want
to modulate blood pressure they're

13252
04:38:40,869 --> 04:38:40,879
to modulate blood pressure they're
 

13253
04:38:40,879 --> 04:38:42,230
to modulate blood pressure they're
legitimate tar Targets in the brain for

13254
04:38:42,230 --> 04:38:42,240
legitimate tar Targets in the brain for
 

13255
04:38:42,240 --> 04:38:43,230
legitimate tar Targets in the brain for
doing

13256
04:38:43,230 --> 04:38:43,240
doing
 

13257
04:38:43,240 --> 04:38:46,670
doing
that um things that aren't immediately

13258
04:38:46,670 --> 04:38:46,680
that um things that aren't immediately
 

13259
04:38:46,680 --> 04:38:48,629
that um things that aren't immediately
obvious as brain

13260
04:38:48,629 --> 04:38:48,639
obvious as brain
 

13261
04:38:48,639 --> 04:38:51,830
obvious as brain
problems are potentially solvable in the

13262
04:38:51,830 --> 04:38:51,840
problems are potentially solvable in the
 

13263
04:38:51,840 --> 04:38:57,670
problems are potentially solvable in the
brain um and so I think it's an under

13264
04:38:57,670 --> 04:38:57,680
brain um and so I think it's an under
 

13265
04:38:57,680 --> 04:39:02,709
brain um and so I think it's an under
explored area for primary treatments of

13266
04:39:02,709 --> 04:39:02,719
explored area for primary treatments of
 

13267
04:39:02,719 --> 04:39:04,830
explored area for primary treatments of
of all the things that bother people

13268
04:39:04,830 --> 04:39:04,840
of all the things that bother people
 

13269
04:39:04,840 --> 04:39:06,189
of all the things that bother people
that's a really fascinating way to look

13270
04:39:06,189 --> 04:39:06,199
that's a really fascinating way to look
 

13271
04:39:06,199 --> 04:39:09,949
that's a really fascinating way to look
at it like there's a lot of conditions

13272
04:39:09,949 --> 04:39:09,959
at it like there's a lot of conditions
 

13273
04:39:09,959 --> 04:39:11,230
at it like there's a lot of conditions
we might think have nothing to do with

13274
04:39:11,230 --> 04:39:11,240
we might think have nothing to do with
 

13275
04:39:11,240 --> 04:39:13,310
we might think have nothing to do with
the brain but they might just be

13276
04:39:13,310 --> 04:39:13,320
the brain but they might just be
 

13277
04:39:13,320 --> 04:39:14,709
the brain but they might just be
symptoms of something that actually

13278
04:39:14,709 --> 04:39:14,719
symptoms of something that actually
 

13279
04:39:14,719 --> 04:39:16,590
symptoms of something that actually
started in the brain the actual source

13280
04:39:16,590 --> 04:39:16,600
started in the brain the actual source
 

13281
04:39:16,600 --> 04:39:18,709
started in the brain the actual source
of the problem the primary source is the

13282
04:39:18,709 --> 04:39:18,719
of the problem the primary source is the
 

13283
04:39:18,719 --> 04:39:20,390
of the problem the primary source is the
is something in the brain yeah not not

13284
04:39:20,390 --> 04:39:20,400
is something in the brain yeah not not
 

13285
04:39:20,400 --> 04:39:21,910
is something in the brain yeah not not
always I mean you know there kidney

13286
04:39:21,910 --> 04:39:21,920
always I mean you know there kidney
 

13287
04:39:21,920 --> 04:39:25,230
always I mean you know there kidney
disease is real uh but um there are

13288
04:39:25,230 --> 04:39:25,240
disease is real uh but um there are
 

13289
04:39:25,240 --> 04:39:27,230
disease is real uh but um there are
levers you can pull in the brain that

13290
04:39:27,230 --> 04:39:27,240
levers you can pull in the brain that
 

13291
04:39:27,240 --> 04:39:29,510
levers you can pull in the brain that
affect all of the all of these systems

13292
04:39:29,510 --> 04:39:29,520
affect all of the all of these systems
 

13293
04:39:29,520 --> 04:39:31,390
affect all of the all of these systems
there's knobs

13294
04:39:31,390 --> 04:39:31,400
there's knobs
 

13295
04:39:31,400 --> 04:39:34,390
there's knobs
yeah onoff switches and knobs in the

13296
04:39:34,390 --> 04:39:34,400
yeah onoff switches and knobs in the
 

13297
04:39:34,400 --> 04:39:38,030
yeah onoff switches and knobs in the
brain from which this all or originates

13298
04:39:38,030 --> 04:39:38,040
brain from which this all or originates
 

13299
04:39:38,040 --> 04:39:40,830
brain from which this all or originates
yeah uh would you have a neuralink chip

13300
04:39:40,830 --> 04:39:40,840
yeah uh would you have a neuralink chip
 

13301
04:39:40,840 --> 04:39:44,510
yeah uh would you have a neuralink chip
implanted in your brain yeah

13302
04:39:44,510 --> 04:39:44,520
implanted in your brain yeah
 

13303
04:39:44,520 --> 04:39:46,310
implanted in your brain yeah
um I

13304
04:39:46,310 --> 04:39:46,320
um I
 

13305
04:39:46,320 --> 04:39:49,070
um I
think use case right now

13306
04:39:49,070 --> 04:39:49,080
think use case right now
 

13307
04:39:49,080 --> 04:39:52,550
think use case right now
is use a mouse right I can already do

13308
04:39:52,550 --> 04:39:52,560
is use a mouse right I can already do
 

13309
04:39:52,560 --> 04:39:56,190
is use a mouse right I can already do
that and so there's no value proposition

13310
04:39:56,190 --> 04:39:56,200
that and so there's no value proposition
 

13311
04:39:56,200 --> 04:39:58,350
that and so there's no value proposition
uh on safety grounds alone sure I would

13312
04:39:58,350 --> 04:39:58,360
uh on safety grounds alone sure I would
 

13313
04:39:58,360 --> 04:40:00,470
uh on safety grounds alone sure I would
do it tomorrow you know you say the use

13314
04:40:00,470 --> 04:40:00,480
do it tomorrow you know you say the use
 

13315
04:40:00,480 --> 04:40:02,550
do it tomorrow you know you say the use
case of the

13316
04:40:02,550 --> 04:40:02,560
case of the
 

13317
04:40:02,560 --> 04:40:05,030
case of the
mouse is after like researching all this

13318
04:40:05,030 --> 04:40:05,040
mouse is after like researching all this
 

13319
04:40:05,040 --> 04:40:06,628
mouse is after like researching all this
and part of is just watching Nolan have

13320
04:40:06,628 --> 04:40:06,638
and part of is just watching Nolan have
 

13321
04:40:06,638 --> 04:40:07,550
and part of is just watching Nolan have
so much

13322
04:40:07,550 --> 04:40:07,560
so much
 

13323
04:40:07,560 --> 04:40:10,270
so much
fun if you can get that bits per second

13324
04:40:10,270 --> 04:40:10,280
fun if you can get that bits per second
 

13325
04:40:10,280 --> 04:40:13,190
fun if you can get that bits per second
like really high with a the mouse like

13326
04:40:13,190 --> 04:40:13,200
like really high with a the mouse like
 

13327
04:40:13,200 --> 04:40:15,350
like really high with a the mouse like
being able to interact because if you

13328
04:40:15,350 --> 04:40:15,360
being able to interact because if you
 

13329
04:40:15,360 --> 04:40:17,230
being able to interact because if you
think about the the way the on the

13330
04:40:17,230 --> 04:40:17,240
think about the the way the on the
 

13331
04:40:17,240 --> 04:40:19,510
think about the the way the on the
smartphone the way you swipe that was

13332
04:40:19,510 --> 04:40:19,520
smartphone the way you swipe that was
 

13333
04:40:19,520 --> 04:40:21,670
smartphone the way you swipe that was
transformational yeah how we interact

13334
04:40:21,670 --> 04:40:21,680
transformational yeah how we interact
 

13335
04:40:21,680 --> 04:40:23,750
transformational yeah how we interact
with a thing it's subtle you don't

13336
04:40:23,750 --> 04:40:23,760
with a thing it's subtle you don't
 

13337
04:40:23,760 --> 04:40:25,270
with a thing it's subtle you don't
realize it but you're able to touch a

13338
04:40:25,270 --> 04:40:25,280
realize it but you're able to touch a
 

13339
04:40:25,280 --> 04:40:29,230
realize it but you're able to touch a
phone and to uh scroll with your finger

13340
04:40:29,230 --> 04:40:29,240
phone and to uh scroll with your finger
 

13341
04:40:29,240 --> 04:40:31,150
phone and to uh scroll with your finger
that's like that changed everything that

13342
04:40:31,150 --> 04:40:31,160
that's like that changed everything that
 

13343
04:40:31,160 --> 04:40:32,830
that's like that changed everything that
people were sure you need a keyboard to

13344
04:40:32,830 --> 04:40:32,840
people were sure you need a keyboard to
 

13345
04:40:32,840 --> 04:40:33,708
people were sure you need a keyboard to
type

13346
04:40:33,708 --> 04:40:33,718
type
 

13347
04:40:33,718 --> 04:40:38,350
type
and that uh there's a lot of HCI aspects

13348
04:40:38,350 --> 04:40:38,360
and that uh there's a lot of HCI aspects
 

13349
04:40:38,360 --> 04:40:40,910
and that uh there's a lot of HCI aspects
to that that changed how we interact

13350
04:40:40,910 --> 04:40:40,920
to that that changed how we interact
 

13351
04:40:40,920 --> 04:40:42,750
to that that changed how we interact
with Compu computers so there could be a

13352
04:40:42,750 --> 04:40:42,760
with Compu computers so there could be a
 

13353
04:40:42,760 --> 04:40:46,150
with Compu computers so there could be a
certain rate of speed with the mouse

13354
04:40:46,150 --> 04:40:46,160
certain rate of speed with the mouse
 

13355
04:40:46,160 --> 04:40:48,390
certain rate of speed with the mouse
that would change everything yes like

13356
04:40:48,390 --> 04:40:48,400
that would change everything yes like
 

13357
04:40:48,400 --> 04:40:49,990
that would change everything yes like
you might be able to just click around a

13358

you might be able to just click around a
 

13359
04:40:50,000 --> 04:40:53,708
you might be able to just click around a
screen extremely fast and

13360
04:40:53,708 --> 04:40:53,718

that if it I I seem must have gotten the

13362
04:40:57,990 --> 04:40:58,000
that if it I I seem must have gotten the
 

13363
04:40:58,000 --> 04:41:00,350
that if it I I seem must have gotten the
neur link for much more rapid

13364
04:41:00,350 --> 04:41:00,360
neur link for much more rapid

yeah I think recording speech intentions

13368
04:41:06,150 --> 04:41:06,160
yeah I think recording speech intentions
 

13369
04:41:06,160 --> 04:41:08,270
yeah I think recording speech intentions
from the brain might might change things

13370
04:41:08,270 --> 04:41:08,280
from the brain might might change things
 

13371
04:41:08,280 --> 04:41:09,948
from the brain might might change things
as well you know the value proposition

13372

13385
04:41:26,040 --> 04:41:30,270
person can uh can
achieve uh I think taking that out of

13386
04:41:30,270 --> 04:41:30,280
achieve uh I think taking that out of
 

13387
04:41:30,280 --> 04:41:32,708
achieve uh I think taking that out of
the equation and just having a

that is the reason people do it even if
 

13397
04:41:43,638 --> 04:41:45,670
that is the reason people do it even if
you have speech to text that's extremely

13398
04:41:45,670 --> 04:41:45,680
you have speech to text that's extremely

accurate it currently isn't right but it
 

13401
04:41:47,480 --> 04:41:49,948
accurate it currently isn't right but it
say gotten super accurate it'd be

13402
04:41:49,948 --> 04:41:49,958
say gotten super accurate it'd be
 

13403
04:41:49,958 --> 04:41:52,270
say gotten super accurate it'd be
hilarious if people went for neuralink

13404
04:41:52,270 --> 04:41:52,280
hilarious if people went for neuralink

interact with digital devices and the
 

13451
04:42:55,798 --> 04:42:59,190
interact with digital devices and the
way that a smartphone did yeah I would

13452
04:42:59,190 --> 04:42:59,200
way that a smartphone did yeah I would
 

13453
04:42:59,200 --> 04:43:01,310
way that a smartphone did yeah I would
um just having to look into the safety

13454
04:43:01,310 --> 04:43:01,320
um just having to look into the safety
 

13455
04:43:01,320 --> 04:43:02,948
um just having to look into the safety
of everything involved I would totally

13456
04:43:02,948 --> 04:43:02,958
of everything involved I would totally
 

13457
04:43:02,958 --> 04:43:05,750
of everything involved I would totally
try it so it doesn't have to go to some

technology on the academic side is
 

13479
04:43:25,760 --> 04:43:27,470
technology on the academic side is
progressing at light speed here I think

13480
04:43:27,470 --> 04:43:27,480
progressing at light speed here I think
 

13481
04:43:27,480 --> 04:43:30,708
progressing at light speed here I think
there was a really amazing paper out of

13482
04:43:30,708 --> 04:43:30,718
there was a really amazing paper out of
 

13483
04:43:30,718 --> 04:43:34,430
there was a really amazing paper out of
UC Davis Sergey stavis lab that

13484
04:43:34,430 --> 04:43:34,440
UC Davis Sergey stavis lab that
 

13485
04:43:34,440 --> 04:43:38,708
UC Davis Sergey stavis lab that
basically made a initial solve of speech

13486
04:43:38,708 --> 04:43:38,718
basically made a initial solve of speech
 

13487
04:43:38,718 --> 04:43:41,830
basically made a initial solve of speech
decode it was something like 125 5,000

13488
04:43:41,830 --> 04:43:41,840
decode it was something like 125 5,000
 

13489
04:43:41,840 --> 04:43:44,350
decode it was something like 125 5,000
words uh that they were getting with you

words uh that they were getting with you
 

13491
04:43:44,360 --> 04:43:47,110
words uh that they were getting with you
know very high accuracy which is so

13492
04:43:47,110 --> 04:43:47,120
know very high accuracy which is so
 

13493
04:43:47,120 --> 04:43:49,150
know very high accuracy which is so
you're just thinking the word yeah

13513
04:44:13,400 --> 04:44:15,590
and if if you get the feedback that it
actually worked you can get really good

13514
04:44:15,590 --> 04:44:15,600
actually worked you can get really good
 

13515
04:44:15,600 --> 04:44:17,590
actually worked you can get really good
at that like your brain will first of

13516
04:44:17,590 --> 04:44:17,600
at that like your brain will first of
 

13517
04:44:17,600 --> 04:44:19,350
at that like your brain will first of
all adjust and you develop like any

13518
04:44:19,350 --> 04:44:19,360
all adjust and you develop like any
 

13519
04:44:19,360 --> 04:44:21,510
all adjust and you develop like any
other skill yeah like touch typing you

13520
04:44:21,510 --> 04:44:21,520
other skill yeah like touch typing you
 

13521
04:44:21,520 --> 04:44:23,910
other skill yeah like touch typing you
develop in that same kind of way that is

13522
04:44:23,910 --> 04:44:23,920
develop in that same kind of way that is
 

13523
04:44:23,920 --> 04:44:26,070
develop in that same kind of way that is
that is really to me it's just really

13524
04:44:26,070 --> 04:44:26,080
that is really to me it's just really
 

13525
04:44:26,080 --> 04:44:28,190
that is really to me it's just really
fascinating yeah to be able to even to

13526
04:44:28,190 --> 04:44:28,200
fascinating yeah to be able to even to
 

13527
04:44:28,200 --> 04:44:30,270
fascinating yeah to be able to even to
play with that honestly like I would get

13528
04:44:30,270 --> 04:44:30,280
play with that honestly like I would get
 

13529
04:44:30,280 --> 04:44:31,788
play with that honestly like I would get
a new link just to be able to play with

13530
04:44:31,788 --> 04:44:31,798
a new link just to be able to play with
 

13531
04:44:31,798 --> 04:44:34,750
a new link just to be able to play with
that just to play with the capacity the

13532
04:44:34,750 --> 04:44:34,760
that just to play with the capacity the
 

13533
04:44:34,760 --> 04:44:36,708
that just to play with the capacity the
capability of my mind to learn this

13534
04:44:36,708 --> 04:44:36,718
capability of my mind to learn this
 

13535
04:44:36,718 --> 04:44:38,830
capability of my mind to learn this
skill it's like learning the skill of

13536
04:44:38,830 --> 04:44:38,840
skill it's like learning the skill of
 

13537
04:44:38,840 --> 04:44:40,350
skill it's like learning the skill of
typing or learning the skill of moving a

13538
04:44:40,350 --> 04:44:40,360
typing or learning the skill of moving a
 

13539
04:44:40,360 --> 04:44:43,470
typing or learning the skill of moving a
mouse it's another skill of moving the

13540
04:44:43,470 --> 04:44:43,480
mouse it's another skill of moving the
 

13541
04:44:43,480 --> 04:44:46,150
mouse it's another skill of moving the
mouse not with my physical body but with

13542
04:44:46,150 --> 04:44:46,160
mouse not with my physical body but with
 

13543
04:44:46,160 --> 04:44:48,670
mouse not with my physical body but with
my mind I can't wait to see what people

13544
04:44:48,670 --> 04:44:48,680
my mind I can't wait to see what people
 

13545
04:44:48,680 --> 04:44:50,430
my mind I can't wait to see what people
do with it I feel like we're we're

13546
04:44:50,430 --> 04:44:50,440
do with it I feel like we're we're
 

13547
04:44:50,440 --> 04:44:52,430
do with it I feel like we're we're
cavemen right now we're we're like

13548
04:44:52,430 --> 04:44:52,440
cavemen right now we're we're like
 

13549
04:44:52,440 --> 04:44:54,070
cavemen right now we're we're like
banging rocks with a stick and thinking

13550
04:44:54,070 --> 04:44:54,080
banging rocks with a stick and thinking
 

13551
04:44:54,080 --> 04:44:57,670
banging rocks with a stick and thinking
that we're making music um at some point

13552
04:44:57,670 --> 04:44:57,680
that we're making music um at some point
 

13553
04:44:57,680 --> 04:44:59,270
that we're making music um at some point
when these are more widespread there's

13554
04:44:59,270 --> 04:44:59,280
when these are more widespread there's
 

13555
04:44:59,280 --> 04:45:02,110
when these are more widespread there's
going to be the equivalent of a of a

13556
04:45:02,110 --> 04:45:02,120
going to be the equivalent of a of a
 

13557
04:45:02,120 --> 04:45:04,910
going to be the equivalent of a of a
piano that you know someone someone can

13558
04:45:04,910 --> 04:45:04,920
piano that you know someone someone can
 

13559
04:45:04,920 --> 04:45:07,030
piano that you know someone someone can
make art with their brain in a way that

13560
04:45:07,030 --> 04:45:07,040
make art with their brain in a way that
 

13561
04:45:07,040 --> 04:45:08,868
make art with their brain in a way that
we didn't even

13562
04:45:08,868 --> 04:45:08,878
we didn't even
 

13563
04:45:08,878 --> 04:45:12,150
we didn't even
anticipate um I'm looking forward to it

13564
04:45:12,150 --> 04:45:12,160
anticipate um I'm looking forward to it
 

13565
04:45:12,160 --> 04:45:14,030
anticipate um I'm looking forward to it
give it to like a teenager like anytime

13566
04:45:14,030 --> 04:45:14,040
give it to like a teenager like anytime
 

13567
04:45:14,040 --> 04:45:15,350
give it to like a teenager like anytime
I think I'm good at something I'll

13568
04:45:15,350 --> 04:45:15,360
I think I'm good at something I'll
 

13569
04:45:15,360 --> 04:45:18,190
I think I'm good at something I'll
always go to like I don't know even even

13570
04:45:18,190 --> 04:45:18,200
always go to like I don't know even even
 

13571
04:45:18,200 --> 04:45:20,190
always go to like I don't know even even
uh even with the the bit per second of

13572
04:45:20,190 --> 04:45:20,200
uh even with the the bit per second of
 

13573
04:45:20,200 --> 04:45:22,190
uh even with the the bit per second of
playing a video game you realize you

13574
04:45:22,190 --> 04:45:22,200
playing a video game you realize you
 

13575
04:45:22,200 --> 04:45:23,590
playing a video game you realize you
give it to a teen you give a your link

13576
04:45:23,590 --> 04:45:23,600
give it to a teen you give a your link
 

13577
04:45:23,600 --> 04:45:25,830
give it to a teen you give a your link
to a teenager just a large number of

13578
04:45:25,830 --> 04:45:25,840
to a teenager just a large number of
 

13579
04:45:25,840 --> 04:45:29,110
to a teenager just a large number of
them the kind of stuff you they get good

13580
04:45:29,110 --> 04:45:29,120
them the kind of stuff you they get good
 

13581
04:45:29,120 --> 04:45:31,670
them the kind of stuff you they get good
at stuff they're going to get like

13582
04:45:31,670 --> 04:45:31,680
at stuff they're going to get like
 

13583
04:45:31,680 --> 04:45:35,788
at stuff they're going to get like
hundreds of uh bits per second yeah even

13584
04:45:35,788 --> 04:45:35,798
hundreds of uh bits per second yeah even
 

13585
04:45:35,798 --> 04:45:37,868
hundreds of uh bits per second yeah even
just with the current technology

13586
04:45:37,868 --> 04:45:37,878
just with the current technology
 

13587
04:45:37,878 --> 04:45:41,470
just with the current technology
probably probably just uh cuz it's also

13588
04:45:41,470 --> 04:45:41,480
probably probably just uh cuz it's also
 

13589
04:45:41,480 --> 04:45:45,590
probably probably just uh cuz it's also
addicting how like the the the number go

13590
04:45:45,590 --> 04:45:45,600
addicting how like the the the number go
 

13591
04:45:45,600 --> 04:45:47,910
addicting how like the the the number go
up aspect of it of like improving and

13592
04:45:47,910 --> 04:45:47,920
up aspect of it of like improving and
 

13593
04:45:47,920 --> 04:45:49,550
up aspect of it of like improving and
training cuz it is it's almost like a

13594
04:45:49,550 --> 04:45:49,560
training cuz it is it's almost like a
 

13595
04:45:49,560 --> 04:45:51,708
training cuz it is it's almost like a
skill and plus there's a software on the

13596
04:45:51,708 --> 04:45:51,718
skill and plus there's a software on the
 

13597
04:45:51,718 --> 04:45:54,230
skill and plus there's a software on the
other end that adapts to you and

13598
04:45:54,230 --> 04:45:54,240
other end that adapts to you and
 

13599
04:45:54,240 --> 04:45:56,350
other end that adapts to you and
especially if the adapting procedure

13600
04:45:56,350 --> 04:45:56,360
especially if the adapting procedure
 

13601
04:45:56,360 --> 04:45:57,788
especially if the adapting procedure
algorithm becomes better and better and

13602
04:45:57,788 --> 04:45:57,798
algorithm becomes better and better and
 

13603
04:45:57,798 --> 04:45:59,788
algorithm becomes better and better and
better you like learning together yeah

13604
04:45:59,788 --> 04:45:59,798
better you like learning together yeah
 

13605
04:45:59,798 --> 04:46:01,310
better you like learning together yeah
we're scratching the surface on that

13606
04:46:01,310 --> 04:46:01,320
we're scratching the surface on that
 

13607
04:46:01,320 --> 04:46:03,470
we're scratching the surface on that
right now there's so much more to do so

13608
04:46:03,470 --> 04:46:03,480
right now there's so much more to do so
 

13609
04:46:03,480 --> 04:46:06,230
right now there's so much more to do so
on the complete other side of it you

13610
04:46:06,230 --> 04:46:06,240
on the complete other side of it you
 

13611
04:46:06,240 --> 04:46:10,270
on the complete other side of it you
have an RFID chip yeah implanted in you

13612
04:46:10,270 --> 04:46:10,280
have an RFID chip yeah implanted in you
 

13613
04:46:10,280 --> 04:46:13,390
have an RFID chip yeah implanted in you
yeah this so I here nice so this is

13614
04:46:13,390 --> 04:46:13,400
yeah this so I here nice so this is
 

13615
04:46:13,400 --> 04:46:15,430
yeah this so I here nice so this is
subtle thing it's a passive device that

13616
04:46:15,430 --> 04:46:15,440
subtle thing it's a passive device that
 

13617
04:46:15,440 --> 04:46:16,270
subtle thing it's a passive device that
you

13618
04:46:16,270 --> 04:46:16,280
you
 

13619
04:46:16,280 --> 04:46:20,190
you
use for unlocking like a a safe with top

13620
04:46:20,190 --> 04:46:20,200
use for unlocking like a a safe with top
 

13621
04:46:20,200 --> 04:46:21,868
use for unlocking like a a safe with top
secrets or what what is what do you use

13622
04:46:21,868 --> 04:46:21,878
secrets or what what is what do you use
 

13623
04:46:21,878 --> 04:46:23,788
secrets or what what is what do you use
it for what's the story behind it I'm

13624
04:46:23,788 --> 04:46:23,798
it for what's the story behind it I'm
 

13625
04:46:23,798 --> 04:46:25,750
it for what's the story behind it I'm
not the first one there's there's this

13626
04:46:25,750 --> 04:46:25,760
not the first one there's there's this
 

13627
04:46:25,760 --> 04:46:28,230
not the first one there's there's this
whole community of weirdo biohackers

13628
04:46:28,230 --> 04:46:28,240
whole community of weirdo biohackers
 

13629
04:46:28,240 --> 04:46:30,750
whole community of weirdo biohackers
that uh have done this stuff and I think

13630
04:46:30,750 --> 04:46:30,760
that uh have done this stuff and I think
 

13631
04:46:30,760 --> 04:46:33,430
that uh have done this stuff and I think
one of the early use cases was storing

13632
04:46:33,430 --> 04:46:33,440
one of the early use cases was storing
 

13633
04:46:33,440 --> 04:46:36,350
one of the early use cases was storing
you know private crypto wallet keys and

13634
04:46:36,350 --> 04:46:36,360
you know private crypto wallet keys and
 

13635
04:46:36,360 --> 04:46:40,590
you know private crypto wallet keys and
and whatever um I dabbled in that a bit

13636
04:46:40,590 --> 04:46:40,600
and whatever um I dabbled in that a bit
 

13637
04:46:40,600 --> 04:46:44,150
and whatever um I dabbled in that a bit
and and had some fun with it um you have

13638
04:46:44,150 --> 04:46:44,160
and and had some fun with it um you have
 

13639
04:46:44,160 --> 04:46:45,708
and and had some fun with it um you have
some bigcoin implanted in your body

13640
04:46:45,708 --> 04:46:45,718
some bigcoin implanted in your body
 

13641
04:46:45,718 --> 04:46:48,110
some bigcoin implanted in your body
somewhere you can't tell where yeah yeah

13642
04:46:48,110 --> 04:46:48,120
somewhere you can't tell where yeah yeah
 

13643
04:46:48,120 --> 04:46:50,788
somewhere you can't tell where yeah yeah
actually yeah uh it was you know the

13644
04:46:50,788 --> 04:46:50,798
actually yeah uh it was you know the
 

13645
04:46:50,798 --> 04:46:52,590
actually yeah uh it was you know the
modern day equivalent of finding change

13646
04:46:52,590 --> 04:46:52,600
modern day equivalent of finding change
 

13647
04:46:52,600 --> 04:46:56,310
modern day equivalent of finding change
in the sofa cushions after I I put some

13648
04:46:56,310 --> 04:46:56,320
in the sofa cushions after I I put some
 

13649
04:46:56,320 --> 04:46:57,750
in the sofa cushions after I I put some
orphan crypto on there that I thought

13650
04:46:57,750 --> 04:46:57,760
orphan crypto on there that I thought
 

13651
04:46:57,760 --> 04:46:59,628
orphan crypto on there that I thought
was worthless and forgot about it for a

13652
04:46:59,628 --> 04:46:59,638
was worthless and forgot about it for a
 

13653
04:46:59,638 --> 04:47:02,628
was worthless and forgot about it for a
few years went back and found that some

13654
04:47:02,628 --> 04:47:02,638
few years went back and found that some
 

13655
04:47:02,638 --> 04:47:05,670
few years went back and found that some
community of people loved it uh and had

13656
04:47:05,670 --> 04:47:05,680
community of people loved it uh and had
 

13657
04:47:05,680 --> 04:47:07,868
community of people loved it uh and had
propped up the value of it and so it had

13658
04:47:07,868 --> 04:47:07,878
propped up the value of it and so it had
 

13659
04:47:07,878 --> 04:47:10,310
propped up the value of it and so it had
gone up 50 fold so there was a lot of

13660
04:47:10,310 --> 04:47:10,320
gone up 50 fold so there was a lot of
 

13661
04:47:10,320 --> 04:47:12,548
gone up 50 fold so there was a lot of
change in those

13662
04:47:12,548 --> 04:47:12,558
change in those

13669
04:47:21,200 --> 04:47:23,670

business card on it you can scan that in

13670
04:47:23,670 --> 04:47:23,680
business card on it you can scan that in
 

13671
04:47:23,680 --> 04:47:27,070
business card on it you can scan that in
uh by touching it to your phone it opens

13672
04:47:27,070 --> 04:47:27,080
uh by touching it to your phone it opens
 

13673
04:47:27,080 --> 04:47:29,070
uh by touching it to your phone it opens
the front door to my house you know

13674
04:47:29,070 --> 04:47:29,080
the front door to my house you know
 

13675
04:47:29,080 --> 04:47:31,150

whatever simple stuff it's a cool step

13676
04:47:31,150 --> 04:47:31,160
whatever simple stuff it's a cool step
 

13677
04:47:31,160 --> 04:47:32,708
whatever simple stuff it's a cool step
it's a cool leap to implant something in

13678
04:47:32,708 --> 04:47:32,718
it's a cool leap to implant something in
 

13679
04:47:32,718 --> 04:47:35,510
it's a cool leap to implant something in
your body I mean it has perhaps that's

13680
04:47:35,510 --> 04:47:35,520
your body I mean it has perhaps that's
 

13681
04:47:35,520 --> 04:47:37,990
your body I mean it has perhaps that's
it's a similar leap to a neur link

13682
04:47:37,990 --> 04:47:38,000
it's a similar leap to a neur link
 

13683
04:47:38,000 --> 04:47:40,070
it's a similar leap to a neur link
because for a lot of people that kind of

13684
04:47:40,070 --> 04:47:40,080
because for a lot of people that kind of
 

13685
04:47:40,080 --> 04:47:41,230
because for a lot of people that kind of
notion of putting putting something

13686
04:47:41,230 --> 04:47:41,240
notion of putting putting something
 

13687
04:47:41,240 --> 04:47:43,190
notion of putting putting something
inside your body something electronic

13688
04:47:43,190 --> 04:47:43,200
inside your body something electronic
 

13689
04:47:43,200 --> 04:47:45,628
inside your body something electronic
inside a biological system is a big leap

13690
04:47:45,628 --> 04:47:45,638
inside a biological system is a big leap
 

13691
04:47:45,638 --> 04:47:47,430
inside a biological system is a big leap
yeah we have a kind of a mysticism

13692
04:47:47,430 --> 04:47:47,440
yeah we have a kind of a mysticism
 

13693
04:47:47,440 --> 04:47:50,830
yeah we have a kind of a mysticism
around the barrier of our skin we're

13694
04:47:50,830 --> 04:47:50,840
around the barrier of our skin we're
 

13695
04:47:50,840 --> 04:47:53,030
around the barrier of our skin we're
completely fine with knee Replacements

13696
04:47:53,030 --> 04:47:53,040
completely fine with knee Replacements

completely fine with knee Replacements
hip replacements you know uh dental

13698
04:47:57,150 --> 04:47:57,160
hip replacements you know uh dental
 

13699
04:47:57,160 --> 04:48:02,910
hip replacements you know uh dental
implants um but uh you know there's a

13700
04:48:02,910 --> 04:48:02,920
implants um but uh you know there's a
 

13701
04:48:02,920 --> 04:48:05,948
implants um but uh you know there's a
mysticism still around the inviable

13702
04:48:05,948 --> 04:48:05,958
mysticism still around the inviable
 

13703

barrier that the skull represents and I

13704
04:48:08,070 --> 04:48:08,080
barrier that the skull represents and I
 

13705
04:48:08,080 --> 04:48:10,990
barrier that the skull represents and I
think that needs to be treated like any

13706
04:48:10,990 --> 04:48:11,000
think that needs to be treated like any
 

13707

04:48:13,990 --> 04:48:14,000
other uh pragmatic barrier you know it's
 

13709
04:48:14,000 --> 04:48:15,788
other uh pragmatic barrier you know it's
the question

13710
04:48:15,788 --> 04:48:15,798
the question
 

13711
04:48:15,798 --> 04:48:18,510
the question
isn't how how incredible is it to open

13712
04:48:18,510 --> 04:48:18,520
isn't how how incredible is it to open
 

13713
04:48:18,520 --> 04:48:20,430
isn't how how incredible is it to open
the skull the question is you know what

04:48:20,430 --> 04:48:20,440
the skull the question is you know what
 

13715
04:48:20,440 --> 04:48:22,510
the skull the question is you know what
benefit can we provide so from all the

benefit can we provide so from all the
 

13717
04:48:22,520 --> 04:48:23,750
benefit can we provide so from all the
surgeries you've done from everything

you understand the

um yeah I think I think there's cause
 

13755
04:49:09,920 --> 04:49:11,310
um yeah I think I think there's cause
for optimism that we might find

04:50:13,558 --> 04:50:18,030
this is from a purely utilitarian
standpoint um can we can we make people

13806
04:50:18,030 --> 04:50:18,040
standpoint um can we can we make people
 

13807
04:50:18,040 --> 04:50:19,510
standpoint um can we can we make people
able to take care of themselves and

13808
04:50:19,510 --> 04:50:19,520
able to take care of themselves and
 

13809
04:50:19,520 --> 04:50:21,868
able to take care of themselves and
their families economically again can we

13810

their families economically again can we
 

13811
04:50:21,878 --> 04:50:24,510
their families economically again can we
make it so someone who's fully dependent

13812
04:50:24,510 --> 04:50:24,520
make it so someone who's fully dependent
 

13813
04:50:24,520 --> 04:50:26,590
make it so someone who's fully dependent
and even maybe requires a lot of

04:50:26,590 --> 04:50:26,600
and even maybe requires a lot of
 

13815
04:50:26,600 --> 04:50:29,948
and even maybe requires a lot of
caregiver resources can we put them in a

04:50:29,948 --> 04:50:29,958
caregiver resources can we put them in a
 

13817
04:50:29,958 --> 04:50:32,548
caregiver resources can we put them in a
position to be fully independent taking

13818
04:50:32,548 --> 04:50:32,558
position to be fully independent taking
 

13819
04:50:32,558 --> 04:50:34,788
position to be fully independent taking
care of themselves giving back to their

13820
04:50:34,788 --> 04:50:34,798
care of themselves giving back to their
 

13821
04:50:34,798 --> 04:50:37,390
care of themselves giving back to their
communities um I think I think that's a

13822
04:50:37,390 --> 04:50:37,400
communities um I think I think that's a
 

13823
04:50:37,400 --> 04:50:40,310
communities um I think I think that's a
very compelling uh proposition and what

13824
04:50:40,310 --> 04:50:40,320
very compelling uh proposition and what
 

13825
04:50:40,320 --> 04:50:42,628
very compelling uh proposition and what
motiv motivates a lot of what I do and

13826
04:50:42,628 --> 04:50:42,638
motiv motivates a lot of what I do and
 

13827
04:50:42,638 --> 04:50:43,910
motiv motivates a lot of what I do and
what a lot of the people at neuralink

13828
04:50:43,910 --> 04:50:43,920
what a lot of the people at neuralink
 

13829
04:50:43,920 --> 04:50:45,868
what a lot of the people at neuralink
are working for it's just a cool

13830
04:50:45,868 --> 04:50:45,878
are working for it's just a cool
 

13831
04:50:45,878 --> 04:50:47,470
are working for it's just a cool
possibility that if you put a neur link

13832
04:50:47,470 --> 04:50:47,480
possibility that if you put a neur link
 

13833
04:50:47,480 --> 04:50:50,310
possibility that if you put a neur link
in there that the brain adapts like the

13834
04:50:50,310 --> 04:50:50,320
in there that the brain adapts like the
 

13835
04:50:50,320 --> 04:50:52,750
in there that the brain adapts like the
the other part of the brain adapts too

13836
04:50:52,750 --> 04:50:52,760
the other part of the brain adapts too
 

13837
04:50:52,760 --> 04:50:54,670
the other part of the brain adapts too
yeah and integrates it the the the

13838
04:50:54,670 --> 04:50:54,680
yeah and integrates it the the the
 

13839
04:50:54,680 --> 04:50:55,948
yeah and integrates it the the the
capacity of the brain to do that is

13840
04:50:55,948 --> 04:50:55,958
capacity of the brain to do that is
 

13841
04:50:55,958 --> 04:50:58,948
capacity of the brain to do that is
really interesting probably unknown to

13842
04:50:58,948 --> 04:50:58,958
really interesting probably unknown to
 

13843
04:50:58,958 --> 04:51:00,868
really interesting probably unknown to
the degree to which you can do that but

13844
04:51:00,868 --> 04:51:00,878
the degree to which you can do that but
 

13845
04:51:00,878 --> 04:51:04,190
the degree to which you can do that but
you're now connecting an external thing

13846
04:51:04,190 --> 04:51:04,200
you're now connecting an external thing
 

13847
04:51:04,200 --> 04:51:09,110
you're now connecting an external thing
to it especially uh once it's doing uh

13848
04:51:09,110 --> 04:51:09,120
to it especially uh once it's doing uh
 

13849
04:51:09,120 --> 04:51:11,670
to it especially uh once it's doing uh
stimulation like

13850
04:51:11,670 --> 04:51:11,680
stimulation like
 

13851
04:51:11,680 --> 04:51:15,150
stimulation like
the the biological brain and the uh the

13852
04:51:15,150 --> 04:51:15,160
the the biological brain and the uh the
 

13853
04:51:15,160 --> 04:51:18,190
the the biological brain and the uh the
electronic brain outside of it working

13854
04:51:18,190 --> 04:51:18,200
electronic brain outside of it working
 

13855
04:51:18,200 --> 04:51:19,830
electronic brain outside of it working
together like the possibilities there

13856
04:51:19,830 --> 04:51:19,840
together like the possibilities there
 

13857
04:51:19,840 --> 04:51:23,430
together like the possibilities there
really interesting still unknown but

13858
04:51:23,430 --> 04:51:23,440
really interesting still unknown but
 

13859
04:51:23,440 --> 04:51:25,590
really interesting still unknown but
interesting it feels like the brain is

13860
04:51:25,590 --> 04:51:25,600
interesting it feels like the brain is
 

13861
04:51:25,600 --> 04:51:28,628
interesting it feels like the brain is
really good at adapting to whatever yeah

13862
04:51:28,628 --> 04:51:28,638
really good at adapting to whatever yeah
 

13863
04:51:28,638 --> 04:51:30,590
really good at adapting to whatever yeah
but of course it is a system that by

13864
04:51:30,590 --> 04:51:30,600
but of course it is a system that by
 

13865
04:51:30,600 --> 04:51:31,750
but of course it is a system that by
itself is

13866
04:51:31,750 --> 04:51:31,760
itself is
 

13867
04:51:31,760 --> 04:51:35,470
itself is
already uh like everything serves the

13868
04:51:35,470 --> 04:51:35,480
already uh like everything serves the
 

13869
04:51:35,480 --> 04:51:38,190
already uh like everything serves the
purpose and so you don't want to mess

13870
04:51:38,190 --> 04:51:38,200
purpose and so you don't want to mess
 

13871
04:51:38,200 --> 04:51:41,510
purpose and so you don't want to mess
with it too much yeah it's like

13872
04:51:41,510 --> 04:51:41,520
with it too much yeah it's like
 

13873
04:51:41,520 --> 04:51:43,750
with it too much yeah it's like
you know eliminating a species from a

13874
04:51:43,750 --> 04:51:43,760
you know eliminating a species from a
 

13875
04:51:43,760 --> 04:51:45,548
you know eliminating a species from a
from an ecology you know you don't know

13876
04:51:45,548 --> 04:51:45,558
from an ecology you know you don't know
 

13877
04:51:45,558 --> 04:51:47,390
from an ecology you know you don't know
what the delicate interconnections and

13878
04:51:47,390 --> 04:51:47,400
what the delicate interconnections and
 

13879
04:51:47,400 --> 04:51:48,548
what the delicate interconnections and
dependencies

13880
04:51:48,548 --> 04:51:48,558
dependencies
 

13881
04:51:48,558 --> 04:51:53,590
dependencies
are um the brain is certainly a delicate

13882
04:51:53,590 --> 04:51:53,600
are um the brain is certainly a delicate
 

13883
04:51:53,600 --> 04:51:56,310
are um the brain is certainly a delicate
complex beast and we don't

13884
04:51:56,310 --> 04:51:56,320
complex beast and we don't
 

13885
04:51:56,320 --> 04:51:59,190
complex beast and we don't
know uh you know every potential

13886
04:51:59,190 --> 04:51:59,200
know uh you know every potential
 

13887
04:51:59,200 --> 04:52:02,590
know uh you know every potential
Downstream consequence of of a single uh

13888
04:52:02,590 --> 04:52:02,600
Downstream consequence of of a single uh
 

13889
04:52:02,600 --> 04:52:05,150
Downstream consequence of of a single uh
change that we make do you see yourself

13890
04:52:05,150 --> 04:52:05,160
change that we make do you see yourself
 

13891
04:52:05,160 --> 04:52:09,310
change that we make do you see yourself
doing uh so mentioned P1 surgeries of P2

13892
04:52:09,310 --> 04:52:09,320
doing uh so mentioned P1 surgeries of P2
 

13893
04:52:09,320 --> 04:52:12,868
doing uh so mentioned P1 surgeries of P2
P3 P4 P5 five just well more and more

13894
04:52:12,868 --> 04:52:12,878
P3 P4 P5 five just well more and more
 

13895
04:52:12,878 --> 04:52:15,190
P3 P4 P5 five just well more and more
and more humans I think you know it's a

13896
04:52:15,190 --> 04:52:15,200
and more humans I think you know it's a
 

13897
04:52:15,200 --> 04:52:18,390
and more humans I think you know it's a
certain kind of brittleness or you know

13898
04:52:18,390 --> 04:52:18,400
certain kind of brittleness or you know
 

13899
04:52:18,400 --> 04:52:20,910
certain kind of brittleness or you know
a failure on the company's side if we

13900
04:52:20,910 --> 04:52:20,920
a failure on the company's side if we
 

13901
04:52:20,920 --> 04:52:23,430
a failure on the company's side if we
need me to do all the

13902
04:52:23,430 --> 04:52:23,440
need me to do all the
 

13903
04:52:23,440 --> 04:52:27,150
need me to do all the
surgeries um I think something that I

13904
04:52:27,150 --> 04:52:27,160
surgeries um I think something that I
 

13905
04:52:27,160 --> 04:52:30,948
surgeries um I think something that I
would very much like to work towards is

13906
04:52:30,948 --> 04:52:30,958
would very much like to work towards is
 

13907
04:52:30,958 --> 04:52:32,990
would very much like to work towards is
a process that is so simple and so

13908
04:52:32,990 --> 04:52:33,000
a process that is so simple and so
 

13909
04:52:33,000 --> 04:52:35,110
a process that is so simple and so
robust on the surgery side that

13910
04:52:35,110 --> 04:52:35,120
robust on the surgery side that
 

13911
04:52:35,120 --> 04:52:38,590
robust on the surgery side that
literally anyone could do it um we want

13912
04:52:38,590 --> 04:52:38,600
literally anyone could do it um we want
 

13913
04:52:38,600 --> 04:52:41,310
literally anyone could do it um we want
to get away from requiring

13914
04:52:41,310 --> 04:52:41,320
to get away from requiring
 

13915
04:52:41,320 --> 04:52:44,270
to get away from requiring
intense expertise or intense

13916
04:52:44,270 --> 04:52:44,280
intense expertise or intense
 

13917
04:52:44,280 --> 04:52:46,230
intense expertise or intense
experience uh to to have this

13918
04:52:46,230 --> 04:52:46,240
experience uh to to have this
 

13919
04:52:46,240 --> 04:52:48,868
experience uh to to have this
successfully done and make it as as

13920
04:52:48,868 --> 04:52:48,878
successfully done and make it as as
 

13921
04:52:48,878 --> 04:52:51,708
successfully done and make it as as
simple and translatable as possible I

13922
04:52:51,708 --> 04:52:51,718
simple and translatable as possible I
 

13923
04:52:51,718 --> 04:52:52,590
simple and translatable as possible I
mean I would love it if every

13924
04:52:52,590 --> 04:52:52,600
mean I would love it if every
 

13925
04:52:52,600 --> 04:52:54,670
mean I would love it if every
neurosurgeon on the planet had no

13926
04:52:54,670 --> 04:52:54,680
neurosurgeon on the planet had no
 

13927
04:52:54,680 --> 04:52:58,548
neurosurgeon on the planet had no
problem doing this um I think we're

13928
04:52:58,548 --> 04:52:58,558
problem doing this um I think we're
 

13929
04:52:58,558 --> 04:53:00,030
problem doing this um I think we're
probably far from a regulatory

13930
04:53:00,030 --> 04:53:00,040
probably far from a regulatory
 

13931
04:53:00,040 --> 04:53:01,628
probably far from a regulatory
environment that would

13932
04:53:01,628 --> 04:53:01,638
environment that would
 

13933
04:53:01,638 --> 04:53:03,310
environment that would
allow uh people that aren't

13934
04:53:03,310 --> 04:53:03,320
allow uh people that aren't
 

13935
04:53:03,320 --> 04:53:07,070
allow uh people that aren't
neurosurgeons to do this but uh not

13936
04:53:07,070 --> 04:53:07,080
neurosurgeons to do this but uh not
 

13937
04:53:07,080 --> 04:53:09,430
neurosurgeons to do this but uh not
impossible all right I'll sign up for

13938
04:53:09,430 --> 04:53:09,440
impossible all right I'll sign up for
 

13939
04:53:09,440 --> 04:53:12,350
impossible all right I'll sign up for
that did you ever anthropomorphize the

13940
04:53:12,350 --> 04:53:12,360
that did you ever anthropomorphize the
 

13941
04:53:12,360 --> 04:53:16,548
that did you ever anthropomorphize the
the robot R1 like do you do you give it

13942
04:53:16,548 --> 04:53:16,558
the robot R1 like do you do you give it
 

13943
04:53:16,558 --> 04:53:18,548
the robot R1 like do you do you give it
a name do you see it as like a friend

13944
04:53:18,548 --> 04:53:18,558
a name do you see it as like a friend
 

13945
04:53:18,558 --> 04:53:20,190
a name do you see it as like a friend
that's like working together with you I

13946
04:53:20,190 --> 04:53:20,200
that's like working together with you I
 

13947
04:53:20,200 --> 04:53:21,868
that's like working together with you I
mean to a certain degree it's or an

13948
04:53:21,868 --> 04:53:21,878
mean to a certain degree it's or an
 

13949
04:53:21,878 --> 04:53:24,788
mean to a certain degree it's or an
enemy who's going to take the

13950
04:53:24,788 --> 04:53:24,798
enemy who's going to take the
 

13951
04:53:24,798 --> 04:53:27,948
enemy who's going to take the
job to a certain degree it's it's yeah

13952
04:53:27,948 --> 04:53:27,958
job to a certain degree it's it's yeah
 

13953
04:53:27,958 --> 04:53:31,470
job to a certain degree it's it's yeah
it's complex relationship uh all the

13954
04:53:31,470 --> 04:53:31,480
it's complex relationship uh all the
 

13955
04:53:31,480 --> 04:53:33,830
it's complex relationship uh all the
good relationships are it's funny when

13956
04:53:33,830 --> 04:53:33,840
good relationships are it's funny when
 

13957
04:53:33,840 --> 04:53:35,350
good relationships are it's funny when
in the middle of the surgery there's a

13958
04:53:35,350 --> 04:53:35,360
in the middle of the surgery there's a
 

13959
04:53:35,360 --> 04:53:37,190
in the middle of the surgery there's a
part of it where I stand should

13960
04:53:37,190 --> 04:53:37,200
part of it where I stand should
 

13961
04:53:37,200 --> 04:53:39,110
part of it where I stand should
basically shoulder-to-shoulder with the

13962
04:53:39,110 --> 04:53:39,120
basically shoulder-to-shoulder with the
 

13963
04:53:39,120 --> 04:53:42,430
basically shoulder-to-shoulder with the
robot um and so you know if you're in

13964
04:53:42,430 --> 04:53:42,440
robot um and so you know if you're in
 

13965
04:53:42,440 --> 04:53:44,750
robot um and so you know if you're in
the room reading the body language you

13966
04:53:44,750 --> 04:53:44,760
the room reading the body language you
 

13967
04:53:44,760 --> 04:53:46,548
the room reading the body language you
know that's it's my brother in arms

13968
04:53:46,548 --> 04:53:46,558
know that's it's my brother in arms

14049
04:55:46,760 --> 04:55:50,150
die uh on the other hand it's
just one of the hardest things to

but um I can at least say that I'm
 

14071
04:56:18,200 --> 04:56:21,470
but um I can at least say that I'm
comfortable with the certainty of it uh

14072
04:56:21,470 --> 04:56:21,480
comfortable with the certainty of it uh
 

14073
04:56:21,480 --> 04:56:22,910
comfortable with the certainty of it uh
if

maybe I've come to accept the
 

14085
04:56:36,638 --> 04:56:41,230
maybe I've come to accept the
intellectual certainty of it but

14093
04:56:48,920 --> 04:56:52,270
think I've come to understand the
existential aspect of it like that this

14094
04:56:52,270 --> 04:56:52,280
existential aspect of it like that this
 

14095
04:56:52,280 --> 04:56:55,990
existential aspect of it like that this
is going to end and I don't mean

14096
04:56:55,990 --> 04:56:56,000
is going to end and I don't mean
 

14097

moment maybe today it's like a it it
 

14113

all that in with Ernest Becker's Terror

14116
04:57:27,070 --> 04:57:27,080
all that in with Ernest Becker's Terror
 

14117
04:57:27,080 --> 04:57:29,230
all that in with Ernest Becker's Terror
like it's a real fear I think people

14118

like it's a real fear I think people
 

14119

14123
04:57:34,878 --> 04:57:36,708
it is yeah um I think the more you are
able to really think through it the more

14124
04:57:36,708 --> 04:57:36,718
able to really think through it the more
 

14125
04:57:36,718 --> 04:57:38,990
able to really think through it the more
terrifying it is it's it's not such a

14126
04:57:38,990 --> 04:57:39,000
terrifying it is it's it's not such a
 

14127
04:57:39,000 --> 04:57:40,788
terrifying it is it's it's not such a
simple thing oh well this the way life

14128

14129
04:57:40,798 --> 04:57:44,548
simple thing oh well this the way life
is and if you really can load that

in uh it's hard but I think that's why
 

14133
04:57:48,240 --> 04:57:51,070
in uh it's hard but I think that's why
the stoics did it because it like helps

in your
 

14159
04:58:21,240 --> 04:58:24,510
in your
position when you mentioned armor just

14160
04:58:24,510 --> 04:58:24,520
position when you mentioned armor just
 

14161
04:58:24,520 --> 04:58:25,788
position when you mentioned armor just
to see

14162
04:58:25,788 --> 04:58:25,798
to see
 

14163
04:58:25,798 --> 04:58:29,430
to see
death it might make you not be able to

14164
04:58:29,430 --> 04:58:29,440
death it might make you not be able to
 

14165
04:58:29,440 --> 04:58:32,350
death it might make you not be able to
see that the the finiteness of life

14166
04:58:32,350 --> 04:58:32,360
see that the the finiteness of life
 

14167
04:58:32,360 --> 04:58:35,070
see that the the finiteness of life
because if you kept looking at that it

14168
04:58:35,070 --> 04:58:35,080
because if you kept looking at that it
 

14169
04:58:35,080 --> 04:58:38,670
because if you kept looking at that it
might break you so it it's good to know

14170
04:58:38,670 --> 04:58:38,680
might break you so it it's good to know
 

14171
04:58:38,680 --> 04:58:41,030
might break you so it it's good to know
that you're kind of still struggling

14172
04:58:41,030 --> 04:58:41,040
that you're kind of still struggling
 

14173
04:58:41,040 --> 04:58:43,590
that you're kind of still struggling
with that there's the the neurosurgeon

14174
04:58:43,590 --> 04:58:43,600
with that there's the the neurosurgeon
 

14175
04:58:43,600 --> 04:58:45,948
with that there's the the neurosurgeon
and then there's a human yeah and the

14176
04:58:45,948 --> 04:58:45,958
and then there's a human yeah and the
 

14177
04:58:45,958 --> 04:58:48,510
and then there's a human yeah and the
human is still able to struggle with

14178
04:58:48,510 --> 04:58:48,520
human is still able to struggle with
 

14179
04:58:48,520 --> 04:58:50,230
human is still able to struggle with
that and feel the the fear of that and

14180
04:58:50,230 --> 04:58:50,240
that and feel the the fear of that and
 

14181
04:58:50,240 --> 04:58:52,470
that and feel the the fear of that and
the pain of that yeah you know it

14182
04:58:52,470 --> 04:58:52,480
the pain of that yeah you know it
 

14183
04:58:52,480 --> 04:58:54,708
the pain of that yeah you know it
definitely makes you ask the question of

14184
04:58:54,708 --> 04:58:54,718
definitely makes you ask the question of
 

14185
04:58:54,718 --> 04:58:57,830
definitely makes you ask the question of
how long how many time how many of these

14186
04:58:57,830 --> 04:58:57,840
how long how many time how many of these
 

14187
04:58:57,840 --> 04:59:01,350
how long how many time how many of these
can you see and uh and not say I can't

14188
04:59:01,350 --> 04:59:01,360
can you see and uh and not say I can't
 

14189
04:59:01,360 --> 04:59:03,310
can you see and uh and not say I can't
do this

14190
04:59:03,310 --> 04:59:03,320
do this
 

14191
04:59:03,320 --> 04:59:06,070
do this
anymore

14192
04:59:06,070 --> 04:59:06,080
anymore
 

14193
04:59:06,080 --> 04:59:10,788
anymore
um but I mean you said it well I think

14194
04:59:10,788 --> 04:59:10,798
um but I mean you said it well I think
 

14195
04:59:10,798 --> 04:59:12,390
um but I mean you said it well I think
it gives you an opportunity to just

14196
04:59:12,390 --> 04:59:12,400
it gives you an opportunity to just
 

14197
04:59:12,400 --> 04:59:15,030
it gives you an opportunity to just
appreciate that you're alive

14198
04:59:15,030 --> 04:59:15,040
appreciate that you're alive

and I'm really happy things are good I
get to help on a project that I think

14208
04:59:26,430 --> 04:59:26,440
get to help on a project that I think
 

14209
04:59:26,440 --> 04:59:29,110
get to help on a project that I think
matters I think it moves us forward I'm

14210
04:59:29,110 --> 04:59:29,120
matters I think it moves us forward I'm
 

14211
04:59:29,120 --> 04:59:32,070
matters I think it moves us forward I'm
a very lucky person it's the early steps

14212
04:59:32,070 --> 04:59:32,080
a very lucky person it's the early steps
 

14213
04:59:32,080 --> 04:59:33,910
a very lucky person it's the early steps
of a

14214
04:59:33,910 --> 04:59:33,920
of a
 

14215
04:59:33,920 --> 04:59:36,548
of a
potentially uh gigantic leap for

14216
04:59:36,548 --> 04:59:36,558
potentially uh gigantic leap for
 

14217
04:59:36,558 --> 04:59:39,070
potentially uh gigantic leap for
Humanity it's a really interesting one

14218
04:59:39,070 --> 04:59:39,080
Humanity it's a really interesting one
 

14219
04:59:39,080 --> 04:59:40,948
Humanity it's a really interesting one
and it's cool cuz like you you read

14220
04:59:40,948 --> 04:59:40,958
and it's cool cuz like you you read
 

14221
04:59:40,958 --> 04:59:42,390
and it's cool cuz like you you read
about all this stuff in history where

14222
04:59:42,390 --> 04:59:42,400
about all this stuff in history where
 

14223
04:59:42,400 --> 04:59:44,030
about all this stuff in history where
it's like the early days I've been

14224
04:59:44,030 --> 04:59:44,040
it's like the early days I've been
 

14225
04:59:44,040 --> 04:59:46,190
it's like the early days I've been
reading uh before going to the Amazon I

14226
04:59:46,190 --> 04:59:46,200
reading uh before going to the Amazon I
 

14227
04:59:46,200 --> 04:59:47,548
reading uh before going to the Amazon I
would read about

14228
04:59:47,548 --> 04:59:47,558
would read about
 

14229
04:59:47,558 --> 04:59:49,910
would read about
explorers uh they would go and explore

14230
04:59:49,910 --> 04:59:49,920
explorers uh they would go and explore
 

14231
04:59:49,920 --> 04:59:51,788
explorers uh they would go and explore
even the Amazon jungle for the first

14232
04:59:51,788 --> 04:59:51,798
even the Amazon jungle for the first
 

14233
04:59:51,798 --> 04:59:54,430
even the Amazon jungle for the first
time it's just those are the early steps

14234
04:59:54,430 --> 04:59:54,440
time it's just those are the early steps
 

14235
04:59:54,440 --> 04:59:56,548
time it's just those are the early steps
yeah or early steps into space early

14236
04:59:56,548 --> 04:59:56,558
yeah or early steps into space early
 

14237
04:59:56,558 --> 04:59:58,670
yeah or early steps into space early
early steps in any discipline in in

14238
04:59:58,670 --> 04:59:58,680
early steps in any discipline in in
 

14239
04:59:58,680 --> 05:00:01,590
early steps in any discipline in in
physics and Mathematics and it's cool

14240
05:00:01,590 --> 05:00:01,600
physics and Mathematics and it's cool
 

14241
05:00:01,600 --> 05:00:04,310
physics and Mathematics and it's cool
cuz this is like the on the grand scale

14242
05:00:04,310 --> 05:00:04,320
cuz this is like the on the grand scale
 

14243
05:00:04,320 --> 05:00:07,628
cuz this is like the on the grand scale
these are the early steps into delving

14244
05:00:07,628 --> 05:00:07,638
these are the early steps into delving
 

14245
05:00:07,638 --> 05:00:10,070
these are the early steps into delving
deep into the human brain so not just

14246
05:00:10,070 --> 05:00:10,080
deep into the human brain so not just
 

14247
05:00:10,080 --> 05:00:11,628
deep into the human brain so not just
observing the brain but be able to

14248
05:00:11,628 --> 05:00:11,638
observing the brain but be able to
 

14249
05:00:11,638 --> 05:00:13,788
observing the brain but be able to
interact with the human brain yeah it's

14250
05:00:13,788 --> 05:00:13,798
interact with the human brain yeah it's
 

14251
05:00:13,798 --> 05:00:15,190
interact with the human brain yeah it's
going to help a lot of people but it

14252
05:00:15,190 --> 05:00:15,200
going to help a lot of people but it
 

14253
05:00:15,200 --> 05:00:16,230
going to help a lot of people but it
also

14254
05:00:16,230 --> 05:00:16,240
also
 

14255
05:00:16,240 --> 05:00:19,708
also
might help us understand what the hell's

14256
05:00:19,708 --> 05:00:19,718
might help us understand what the hell's
 

14257
05:00:19,718 --> 05:00:21,948
might help us understand what the hell's
going on in there yeah I think

14258
05:00:21,948 --> 05:00:21,958
going on in there yeah I think
 

14259
05:00:21,958 --> 05:00:24,670
going on in there yeah I think
ultimately we want to give people more

14260
05:00:24,670 --> 05:00:24,680
ultimately we want to give people more
 

14261
05:00:24,680 --> 05:00:26,990
ultimately we want to give people more
levers that they can pull right like you

14262
05:00:26,990 --> 05:00:27,000
levers that they can pull right like you
 

14263
05:00:27,000 --> 05:00:28,708
levers that they can pull right like you
want to give people

14264
05:00:28,708 --> 05:00:28,718
want to give people
 

14265
05:00:28,718 --> 05:00:32,070
want to give people
options if you can give someone a dial

14266
05:00:32,070 --> 05:00:32,080
options if you can give someone a dial
 

14267
05:00:32,080 --> 05:00:33,150
options if you can give someone a dial
that they can

14268
05:00:33,150 --> 05:00:33,160
that they can
 

14269
05:00:33,160 --> 05:00:36,628
that they can
turn on how happy they

14270
05:00:36,628 --> 05:00:36,638
turn on how happy they
 

14271
05:00:36,638 --> 05:00:38,990
turn on how happy they
are I think that makes people really

14272
05:00:38,990 --> 05:00:39,000
are I think that makes people really
 

14273
05:00:39,000 --> 05:00:41,590
are I think that makes people really
uncomfortable

14274
05:00:41,590 --> 05:00:41,600

brain um you know is that we we have a
 

14427
05:03:53,718 --> 05:03:56,030
brain um you know is that we we have a
really good intuitive understanding of

05:07:12,120 --> 05:07:13,868
to put something in their mouth for some
folks it can mean independent to be able

14586
05:07:13,868 --> 05:07:13,878
folks it can mean independent to be able
 

14587
05:07:13,878 --> 05:07:16,470
folks it can mean independent to be able
to work again to be able to navigate a

14588
05:07:16,470 --> 05:07:16,480
to work again to be able to navigate a
 

14589
05:07:16,480 --> 05:07:18,310
to work again to be able to navigate a
computer digitally efficiently enough to

14590
05:07:18,310 --> 05:07:18,320
computer digitally efficiently enough to
 

14591
05:07:18,320 --> 05:07:19,548
computer digitally efficiently enough to
be able to get a job to be able to

14592
05:07:19,548 --> 05:07:19,558
be able to get a job to be able to
 

14593
05:07:19,558 --> 05:07:21,830
be able to get a job to be able to
support themsel to be able to move out

14594
05:07:21,830 --> 05:07:21,840
support themsel to be able to move out
 

14595
05:07:21,840 --> 05:07:23,548
support themsel to be able to move out
and ultimately be able to supports after

14596
05:07:23,548 --> 05:07:23,558
and ultimately be able to supports after
 

14597
05:07:23,558 --> 05:07:25,470
and ultimately be able to supports after
their family maybe isn't there anymore

14598
05:07:25,470 --> 05:07:25,480
their family maybe isn't there anymore
 

14599
05:07:25,480 --> 05:07:28,628
their family maybe isn't there anymore
to take care of them and uh for some

14600
05:07:28,628 --> 05:07:28,638
to take care of them and uh for some
 

14601
05:07:28,638 --> 05:07:30,110
to take care of them and uh for some
folks it's as simple as just being able

14602
05:07:30,110 --> 05:07:30,120
folks it's as simple as just being able
 

14603
05:07:30,120 --> 05:07:31,788
folks it's as simple as just being able
to respond to their kid in time before

14604
05:07:31,788 --> 05:07:31,798
to respond to their kid in time before
 

14605
05:07:31,798 --> 05:07:33,910
to respond to their kid in time before
they you know run away or get interested

14606
05:07:33,910 --> 05:07:33,920
they you know run away or get interested
 

14607
05:07:33,920 --> 05:07:38,270
they you know run away or get interested
in something else and these are deeply

14608
05:07:38,270 --> 05:07:38,280
in something else and these are deeply
 

14609
05:07:38,280 --> 05:07:41,670
in something else and these are deeply
personal and and sort of very human

14610
05:07:41,670 --> 05:07:41,680
personal and and sort of very human
 

14611
05:07:41,680 --> 05:07:44,030
personal and and sort of very human
problems and what strikes me again and

14612
05:07:44,030 --> 05:07:44,040
problems and what strikes me again and
 

14613
05:07:44,040 --> 05:07:45,430
problems and what strikes me again and
again when talking with these folks is

14614
05:07:45,430 --> 05:07:45,440
again when talking with these folks is
 

14615
05:07:45,440 --> 05:07:47,470
again when talking with these folks is
that this is actually an engineering

14616
05:07:47,470 --> 05:07:47,480
that this is actually an engineering
 

14617
05:07:47,480 --> 05:07:49,628
that this is actually an engineering
problem this is a problem that with the

14618
05:07:49,628 --> 05:07:49,638
problem this is a problem that with the
 

14619
05:07:49,638 --> 05:07:52,350
problem this is a problem that with the
right Resources with the right team we

14620
05:07:52,350 --> 05:07:52,360
right Resources with the right team we
 

14621
05:07:52,360 --> 05:07:55,670
right Resources with the right team we
can make a lot of progress on and uh at

14622
05:07:55,670 --> 05:07:55,680
can make a lot of progress on and uh at
 

14623
05:07:55,680 --> 05:07:56,708
can make a lot of progress on and uh at
the end of the day I think that's a

14624
05:07:56,708 --> 05:07:56,718
the end of the day I think that's a
 

14625
05:07:56,718 --> 05:07:58,510
the end of the day I think that's a
deeply inspiring message and something

14626
05:07:58,510 --> 05:07:58,520
deeply inspiring message and something
 

14627
05:07:58,520 --> 05:08:00,190
deeply inspiring message and something
that makes me excited to get up every

14628
05:08:00,190 --> 05:08:00,200
that makes me excited to get up every
 

14629
05:08:00,200 --> 05:08:02,990
that makes me excited to get up every
day so it's both an engineering problem

14630
05:08:02,990 --> 05:08:03,000
day so it's both an engineering problem
 

14631
05:08:03,000 --> 05:08:05,590
day so it's both an engineering problem
in terms of a BCI for example that can

14632
05:08:05,590 --> 05:08:05,600
in terms of a BCI for example that can
 

14633
05:08:05,600 --> 05:08:07,230
in terms of a BCI for example that can
give them capabilities where they can

14634
05:08:07,230 --> 05:08:07,240
give them capabilities where they can
 

14635
05:08:07,240 --> 05:08:09,110
give them capabilities where they can
interact with the world but also on the

14636
05:08:09,110 --> 05:08:09,120
interact with the world but also on the
 

14637
05:08:09,120 --> 05:08:10,270
interact with the world but also on the
other side

14638
05:08:10,270 --> 05:08:10,280
other side
 

14639
05:08:10,280 --> 05:08:11,670
other side
it's an engineering problem for the rest

14640
05:08:11,670 --> 05:08:11,680
it's an engineering problem for the rest
 

14641
05:08:11,680 --> 05:08:13,510
it's an engineering problem for the rest
of the world to make it more accessible

14642
05:08:13,510 --> 05:08:13,520
of the world to make it more accessible
 

14643
05:08:13,520 --> 05:08:16,190
of the world to make it more accessible
for people living with quadriplegia yeah

14644
05:08:16,190 --> 05:08:16,200
for people living with quadriplegia yeah
 

14645
05:08:16,200 --> 05:08:18,670
for people living with quadriplegia yeah
and I I'll take a Broadview sort of lens

14646
05:08:18,670 --> 05:08:18,680
and I I'll take a Broadview sort of lens
 

14647
05:08:18,680 --> 05:08:21,390
and I I'll take a Broadview sort of lens
on this for a second I think I'm very in

14648
05:08:21,390 --> 05:08:21,400
on this for a second I think I'm very in
 

14649
05:08:21,400 --> 05:08:23,110
on this for a second I think I'm very in
favor of anyone working in this problem

14650
05:08:23,110 --> 05:08:23,120
favor of anyone working in this problem
 

14651
05:08:23,120 --> 05:08:25,830
favor of anyone working in this problem
space so beyond BCI I'm I'm happy and

14652
05:08:25,830 --> 05:08:25,840
space so beyond BCI I'm I'm happy and
 

14653
05:08:25,840 --> 05:08:27,390
space so beyond BCI I'm I'm happy and
excited and willing to support in any

14654
05:08:27,390 --> 05:08:27,400
excited and willing to support in any
 

14655
05:08:27,400 --> 05:08:29,030
excited and willing to support in any
way I can folks working on ey tracking

14656
05:08:29,030 --> 05:08:29,040
way I can folks working on ey tracking
 

14657
05:08:29,040 --> 05:08:30,868
way I can folks working on ey tracking
systems working on you know speech

14658
05:08:30,868 --> 05:08:30,878
systems working on you know speech
 

14659
05:08:30,878 --> 05:08:33,230
systems working on you know speech
detect systems working on head trackers

14660
05:08:33,230 --> 05:08:33,240
detect systems working on head trackers
 

14661
05:08:33,240 --> 05:08:35,110
detect systems working on head trackers
or Mouse sticks or quad sticks and I've

14662
05:08:35,110 --> 05:08:35,120
or Mouse sticks or quad sticks and I've
 

14663
05:08:35,120 --> 05:08:36,590
or Mouse sticks or quad sticks and I've
met many engineers and folks in the

14664
05:08:36,590 --> 05:08:36,600
met many engineers and folks in the
 

14665
05:08:36,600 --> 05:08:38,948
met many engineers and folks in the
community that do exactly those things

14666
05:08:38,948 --> 05:08:38,958
community that do exactly those things
 

14667
05:08:38,958 --> 05:08:40,708
community that do exactly those things
and I think for the people who were

14668
05:08:40,708 --> 05:08:40,718
and I think for the people who were
 

14669
05:08:40,718 --> 05:08:42,510
and I think for the people who were
trying to help it doesn't matter what

14670
05:08:42,510 --> 05:08:42,520
trying to help it doesn't matter what
 

14671
05:08:42,520 --> 05:08:43,910
trying to help it doesn't matter what
the complexity of the solution is as

14672
05:08:43,910 --> 05:08:43,920
the complexity of the solution is as
 

14673
05:08:43,920 --> 05:08:46,830
the complexity of the solution is as
long as the problem is solved and I want

14674
05:08:46,830 --> 05:08:46,840
long as the problem is solved and I want
 

14675
05:08:46,840 --> 05:08:48,788
long as the problem is solved and I want
to emphasize that there can be many

14676
05:08:48,788 --> 05:08:48,798
to emphasize that there can be many
 

14677
05:08:48,798 --> 05:08:50,110
to emphasize that there can be many
solutions out there that can help with

14678
05:08:50,110 --> 05:08:50,120
solutions out there that can help with
 

14679
05:08:50,120 --> 05:08:52,910
solutions out there that can help with
these problems and uh BCI is one of a

14680
05:08:52,910 --> 05:08:52,920
these problems and uh BCI is one of a
 

14681
05:08:52,920 --> 05:08:55,430
these problems and uh BCI is one of a
collection of of such Solutions so BCI

14682
05:08:55,430 --> 05:08:55,440
collection of of such Solutions so BCI
 

14683
05:08:55,440 --> 05:08:57,470
collection of of such Solutions so BCI
in particular I think offers several

14684
05:08:57,470 --> 05:08:57,480
in particular I think offers several
 

14685
05:08:57,480 --> 05:08:58,990
in particular I think offers several
advantages here and I think the folks

14686
05:08:58,990 --> 05:08:59,000
advantages here and I think the folks
 

14687
05:08:59,000 --> 05:09:00,590
advantages here and I think the folks
that recognize this immediately are

14688
05:09:00,590 --> 05:09:00,600
that recognize this immediately are
 

14689
05:09:00,600 --> 05:09:01,910
that recognize this immediately are
usually the people who have spawner crit

14690
05:09:01,910 --> 05:09:01,920
usually the people who have spawner crit
 

14691
05:09:01,920 --> 05:09:03,868
usually the people who have spawner crit
injury or some form of paralysis usually

14692
05:09:03,868 --> 05:09:03,878
injury or some form of paralysis usually
 

14693
05:09:03,878 --> 05:09:05,070
injury or some form of paralysis usually
you don't have to explain to them why

14694
05:09:05,070 --> 05:09:05,080
you don't have to explain to them why
 

14695
05:09:05,080 --> 05:09:06,070
you don't have to explain to them why
this might be something that could be

14696
05:09:06,070 --> 05:09:06,080
this might be something that could be
 

14697
05:09:06,080 --> 05:09:07,670
this might be something that could be
helpful it's usually pretty self-evident

14698
05:09:07,670 --> 05:09:07,680
helpful it's usually pretty self-evident
 

14699
05:09:07,680 --> 05:09:09,708
helpful it's usually pretty self-evident
but for the rest of us folks that don't

14700
05:09:09,708 --> 05:09:09,718
but for the rest of us folks that don't
 

14701
05:09:09,718 --> 05:09:11,750
but for the rest of us folks that don't
live with severe Spa cour injury or who

14702
05:09:11,750 --> 05:09:11,760
live with severe Spa cour injury or who
 

14703
05:09:11,760 --> 05:09:14,350
live with severe Spa cour injury or who
don't know somebody with ALS uh it's not

14704
05:09:14,350 --> 05:09:14,360
don't know somebody with ALS uh it's not
 

14705
05:09:14,360 --> 05:09:15,788
don't know somebody with ALS uh it's not
often obvious why you would want a brain

14706
05:09:15,788 --> 05:09:15,798
often obvious why you would want a brain
 

14707
05:09:15,798 --> 05:09:17,070
often obvious why you would want a brain
implant to be able to connect and

14708
05:09:17,070 --> 05:09:17,080
implant to be able to connect and
 

14709
05:09:17,080 --> 05:09:19,030
implant to be able to connect and
navigate a computer and it's

14710
05:09:19,030 --> 05:09:19,040
navigate a computer and it's
 

14711
05:09:19,040 --> 05:09:20,628
navigate a computer and it's
surprisingly nuancing to the degree that

14712
05:09:20,628 --> 05:09:20,638
surprisingly nuancing to the degree that
 

14713
05:09:20,638 --> 05:09:22,670
surprisingly nuancing to the degree that
I've learned a huge amount just working

14714
05:09:22,670 --> 05:09:22,680
I've learned a huge amount just working
 

14715
05:09:22,680 --> 05:09:24,350
I've learned a huge amount just working
with Noland in the first narland

14716
05:09:24,350 --> 05:09:24,360
with Noland in the first narland

05:09:28,910 --> 05:09:28,920
him in his words why this device is
 

14721
05:09:28,920 --> 05:09:31,310
him in his words why this device is
impactful for him and it's a Nuance

14722
05:09:31,310 --> 05:09:31,320
impactful for him and it's a Nuance
 

14723
05:09:31,320 --> 05:09:33,150
impactful for him and it's a Nuance
topic it can be the case that even if

14724
05:09:33,150 --> 05:09:33,160
topic it can be the case that even if
 

14725
05:09:33,160 --> 05:09:34,510
topic it can be the case that even if
you can achieve the same thing for

14726
05:09:34,510 --> 05:09:34,520
you can achieve the same thing for
 

14727
05:09:34,520 --> 05:09:35,788
you can achieve the same thing for
example with a mouse stick when

example with a mouse stick when
 

14729
05:09:35,798 --> 05:09:37,628
example with a mouse stick when
navigating a computer he doesn't have

14730
05:09:37,628 --> 05:09:37,638
navigating a computer he doesn't have
 

14731
05:09:37,638 --> 05:09:38,830
navigating a computer he doesn't have
access to that Mouse stick every single

14732
05:09:38,830 --> 05:09:38,840
access to that Mouse stick every single
 

14733
05:09:38,840 --> 05:09:40,310
access to that Mouse stick every single
minute of the day he only has access

14734
05:09:40,310 --> 05:09:40,320
minute of the day he only has access
 

14735
05:09:40,320 --> 05:09:41,510
minute of the day he only has access
when someone is available to put it in

14736
05:09:41,510 --> 05:09:41,520
when someone is available to put it in
 

14737
05:09:41,520 --> 05:09:43,548
when someone is available to put it in
front of him and so a BCI can really

14738
05:09:43,548 --> 05:09:43,558
front of him and so a BCI can really
 

14739
05:09:43,558 --> 05:09:45,590
front of him and so a BCI can really
offer a level of of Independence and

14740
05:09:45,590 --> 05:09:45,600
offer a level of of Independence and
 

14741
05:09:45,600 --> 05:09:48,350
offer a level of of Independence and
autonomy that if it wasn't literally

14742
05:09:48,350 --> 05:09:48,360
autonomy that if it wasn't literally
 

14743
05:09:48,360 --> 05:09:50,470
autonomy that if it wasn't literally
physically part of your body it' be hard

14744
05:09:50,470 --> 05:09:50,480
physically part of your body it' be hard
 

14745
05:09:50,480 --> 05:09:52,830
physically part of your body it' be hard
to achieve in any other way so there's a

14746
05:09:52,830 --> 05:09:52,840
to achieve in any other way so there's a
 

14747
05:09:52,840 --> 05:09:55,628
to achieve in any other way so there's a
lot of fascinating aspects to what it

14748
05:09:55,628 --> 05:09:55,638
lot of fascinating aspects to what it
 

14749
05:09:55,638 --> 05:09:57,030
lot of fascinating aspects to what it
takes to get no one to be able to

14750
05:09:57,030 --> 05:09:57,040
takes to get no one to be able to
 

14751
05:09:57,040 --> 05:09:58,670
takes to get no one to be able to
control a cursor on the screen with his

14752
05:09:58,670 --> 05:09:58,680
control a cursor on the screen with his
 

14753
05:09:58,680 --> 05:10:01,350
control a cursor on the screen with his
mind uh you texted me something that I

14754
05:10:01,350 --> 05:10:01,360
mind uh you texted me something that I
 

14755
05:10:01,360 --> 05:10:03,070
mind uh you texted me something that I
just love you said I was part of the

14756
05:10:03,070 --> 05:10:03,080
just love you said I was part of the
 

14757
05:10:03,080 --> 05:10:05,150
just love you said I was part of the
team that interviewed and selected P1 I

14758
05:10:05,150 --> 05:10:05,160
team that interviewed and selected P1 I
 

14759
05:10:05,160 --> 05:10:07,030
team that interviewed and selected P1 I
was in the operating room doing the

14760
05:10:07,030 --> 05:10:07,040
was in the operating room doing the
 

14761
05:10:07,040 --> 05:10:08,670
was in the operating room doing the
first human surgery monitoring live

14762
05:10:08,670 --> 05:10:08,680
first human surgery monitoring live
 

14763
05:10:08,680 --> 05:10:10,788
first human surgery monitoring live
signals coming out of the brain I work

14764
05:10:10,788 --> 05:10:10,798
signals coming out of the brain I work
 

14765
05:10:10,798 --> 05:10:12,990
signals coming out of the brain I work
with the user basically every day to

14766
05:10:12,990 --> 05:10:13,000
with the user basically every day to
 

14767
05:10:13,000 --> 05:10:15,190
with the user basically every day to
develop new ux paradigms decoding

14768
05:10:15,190 --> 05:10:15,200
develop new ux paradigms decoding
 

14769
05:10:15,200 --> 05:10:17,910
develop new ux paradigms decoding
strategies and I was part of the team

14770
05:10:17,910 --> 05:10:17,920
strategies and I was part of the team
 

14771
05:10:17,920 --> 05:10:19,990
strategies and I was part of the team
that figured out how to recover useful

14772
05:10:19,990 --> 05:10:20,000
that figured out how to recover useful
 

14773
05:10:20,000 --> 05:10:22,350
that figured out how to recover useful
BCI to New World Record levels when the

14774
05:10:22,350 --> 05:10:22,360
BCI to New World Record levels when the
 

14775
05:10:22,360 --> 05:10:25,350
BCI to New World Record levels when the
signal quality degraded we'll talk about

14776
05:10:25,350 --> 05:10:25,360
signal quality degraded we'll talk about
 

14777
05:10:25,360 --> 05:10:28,030
signal quality degraded we'll talk about
I think every aspect of that but um just

14778
05:10:28,030 --> 05:10:28,040
I think every aspect of that but um just
 

14779
05:10:28,040 --> 05:10:30,270
I think every aspect of that but um just
zooming out what was it like to be part

14780
05:10:30,270 --> 05:10:30,280
zooming out what was it like to be part
 

14781
05:10:30,280 --> 05:10:34,548
zooming out what was it like to be part
of that part part of that team and part

14782
05:10:34,548 --> 05:10:34,558
of that part part of that team and part
 

14783
05:10:34,558 --> 05:10:37,390
of that part part of that team and part
of that historic I would say historic

14784
05:10:37,390 --> 05:10:37,400
of that historic I would say historic
 

14785
05:10:37,400 --> 05:10:39,948
of that historic I would say historic
first yeah I think for me this is

14786
05:10:39,948 --> 05:10:39,958
first yeah I think for me this is
 

14787
05:10:39,958 --> 05:10:41,788
first yeah I think for me this is
something I've been excited about for

14788
05:10:41,788 --> 05:10:41,798
something I've been excited about for
 

14789
05:10:41,798 --> 05:10:43,830
something I've been excited about for
close to 10 years now and so to be able

14790
05:10:43,830 --> 05:10:43,840
close to 10 years now and so to be able
 

14791
05:10:43,840 --> 05:10:45,708
close to 10 years now and so to be able
to be even just some small part of

14792
05:10:45,708 --> 05:10:45,718
to be even just some small part of
 

14793
05:10:45,718 --> 05:10:48,470
to be even just some small part of
making it a reality is extremely

14794
05:10:48,470 --> 05:10:48,480
making it a reality is extremely
 

14795
05:10:48,480 --> 05:10:50,590
making it a reality is extremely
exciting a

14796
05:10:50,590 --> 05:10:50,600
exciting a
 

14797
05:10:50,600 --> 05:10:53,070
exciting a
couple maybe special moments during that

14798
05:10:53,070 --> 05:10:53,080
couple maybe special moments during that
 

14799
05:10:53,080 --> 05:10:54,788
couple maybe special moments during that
whole process that I'll never really

14800
05:10:54,788 --> 05:10:54,798
whole process that I'll never really
 

14801
05:10:54,798 --> 05:10:57,910
whole process that I'll never really
truly forget one of them is during the

14802
05:10:57,910 --> 05:10:57,920
truly forget one of them is during the
 

14803
05:10:57,920 --> 05:10:58,948
truly forget one of them is during the
actual

14804
05:10:58,948 --> 05:10:58,958
actual
 

14805
05:10:58,958 --> 05:11:01,350
actual
surgery uh you know at that point in

14806
05:11:01,350 --> 05:11:01,360
surgery uh you know at that point in
 

14807
05:11:01,360 --> 05:11:03,708
surgery uh you know at that point in
time I I know Nolan quite well I know

14808
05:11:03,708 --> 05:11:03,718
time I I know Nolan quite well I know
 

14809
05:11:03,718 --> 05:11:05,590
time I I know Nolan quite well I know
his family and so I think the the

14810
05:11:05,590 --> 05:11:05,600
his family and so I think the the
 

14811
05:11:05,600 --> 05:11:08,030
his family and so I think the the
initial reaction when uh Nolan is rolled

14812
05:11:08,030 --> 05:11:08,040
initial reaction when uh Nolan is rolled
 

14813
05:11:08,040 --> 05:11:10,708
initial reaction when uh Nolan is rolled
into the operating room is just oh

14814
05:11:10,708 --> 05:11:10,718
into the operating room is just oh
 

14815
05:11:10,718 --> 05:11:12,430
into the operating room is just oh
kind of reaction but at that point

14816
05:11:12,430 --> 05:11:12,440
kind of reaction but at that point
 

14817
05:11:12,440 --> 05:11:14,150
kind of reaction but at that point
muscle memory kicks in and you sort of

14818
05:11:14,150 --> 05:11:14,160
muscle memory kicks in and you sort of
 

14819
05:11:14,160 --> 05:11:17,670
muscle memory kicks in and you sort of
go into uh you let your body just do the

14820
05:11:17,670 --> 05:11:17,680
go into uh you let your body just do the
 

14821
05:11:17,680 --> 05:11:19,788
go into uh you let your body just do the
all the all the talking and I have the

14822
05:11:19,788 --> 05:11:19,798
all the all the talking and I have the
 

14823
05:11:19,798 --> 05:11:21,868
all the all the talking and I have the
lucky job in that particular procedure

14824
05:11:21,868 --> 05:11:21,878
lucky job in that particular procedure
 

14825
05:11:21,878 --> 05:11:23,868
lucky job in that particular procedure
to just be in charge of monitoring the

14826
05:11:23,868 --> 05:11:23,878
to just be in charge of monitoring the
 

14827
05:11:23,878 --> 05:11:25,590
to just be in charge of monitoring the
implant so my job is to sit there to

14828
05:11:25,590 --> 05:11:25,600
implant so my job is to sit there to
 

14829
05:11:25,600 --> 05:11:26,670
implant so my job is to sit there to
look at the signals coming off the

14830
05:11:26,670 --> 05:11:26,680
look at the signals coming off the
 

14831
05:11:26,680 --> 05:11:28,510
look at the signals coming off the
implant to look at the live brain data

14832
05:11:28,510 --> 05:11:28,520
implant to look at the live brain data
 

14833
05:11:28,520 --> 05:11:30,150
implant to look at the live brain data
streaming off the device as threads are

14834
05:11:30,150 --> 05:11:30,160
streaming off the device as threads are
 

14835
05:11:30,160 --> 05:11:32,150
streaming off the device as threads are
being inserted into the brain and just

14836
05:11:32,150 --> 05:11:32,160
being inserted into the brain and just
 

14837
05:11:32,160 --> 05:11:33,310
being inserted into the brain and just
to basically observe and make sure that

14838
05:11:33,310 --> 05:11:33,320
to basically observe and make sure that
 

14839
05:11:33,320 --> 05:11:35,390
to basically observe and make sure that
nothing is going you know wrong or that

14840
05:11:35,390 --> 05:11:35,400
nothing is going you know wrong or that
 

14841
05:11:35,400 --> 05:11:36,830
nothing is going you know wrong or that
there's no red flags or fault conditions

14842
05:11:36,830 --> 05:11:36,840
there's no red flags or fault conditions
 

14843
05:11:36,840 --> 05:11:37,990
there's no red flags or fault conditions
that we need to go and investigate or

14844
05:11:37,990 --> 05:11:38,000
that we need to go and investigate or
 

14845
05:11:38,000 --> 05:11:41,470
that we need to go and investigate or
pause the surgery to uh did he bug and

14846
05:11:41,470 --> 05:11:41,480
pause the surgery to uh did he bug and
 

14847
05:11:41,480 --> 05:11:43,708
pause the surgery to uh did he bug and
uh because I had that sort of spectator

14848
05:11:43,708 --> 05:11:43,718
uh because I had that sort of spectator
 

14849
05:11:43,718 --> 05:11:45,110
uh because I had that sort of spectator
view of the surgery I had a slightly

14850
05:11:45,110 --> 05:11:45,120
view of the surgery I had a slightly
 

14851
05:11:45,120 --> 05:11:46,390
view of the surgery I had a slightly
removed perspective than I think most

14852
05:11:46,390 --> 05:11:46,400
removed perspective than I think most
 

14853
05:11:46,400 --> 05:11:48,670
removed perspective than I think most
folks in the room I got to sit there and

14854
05:11:48,670 --> 05:11:48,680
folks in the room I got to sit there and
 

14855
05:11:48,680 --> 05:11:51,190
folks in the room I got to sit there and
think to myself wow you know that brain

14856
05:11:51,190 --> 05:11:51,200
think to myself wow you know that brain
 

14857
05:11:51,200 --> 05:11:52,628
think to myself wow you know that brain
is moving a lot you know when you when

14858
05:11:52,628 --> 05:11:52,638
is moving a lot you know when you when
 

14859
05:11:52,638 --> 05:11:54,350
is moving a lot you know when you when
you look inside little craniectomy that

14860
05:11:54,350 --> 05:11:54,360
you look inside little craniectomy that
 

14861
05:11:54,360 --> 05:11:57,070
you look inside little craniectomy that
we stick the threads in you know one

14862
05:11:57,070 --> 05:11:57,080
we stick the threads in you know one
 

14863
05:11:57,080 --> 05:11:58,350
we stick the threads in you know one
thing that most people don't realize is

14864
05:11:58,350 --> 05:11:58,360
thing that most people don't realize is
 

14865
05:11:58,360 --> 05:12:00,110
thing that most people don't realize is
the brain moves the brain moves a lot

14866
05:12:00,110 --> 05:12:00,120
the brain moves the brain moves a lot
 

14867
05:12:00,120 --> 05:12:02,190
the brain moves the brain moves a lot
when you breathe when your when your uh

14868
05:12:02,190 --> 05:12:02,200
when you breathe when your when your uh
 

14869
05:12:02,200 --> 05:12:04,948
when you breathe when your when your uh
heart beats and you can see it visibly

14870
05:12:04,948 --> 05:12:04,958
heart beats and you can see it visibly
 

14871
05:12:04,958 --> 05:12:06,310
heart beats and you can see it visibly
so you know that's something that I

14872
05:12:06,310 --> 05:12:06,320
so you know that's something that I
 

14873
05:12:06,320 --> 05:12:08,628
so you know that's something that I
think was a surprise to me and very very

14874
05:12:08,628 --> 05:12:08,638
think was a surprise to me and very very
 

14875
05:12:08,638 --> 05:12:09,750
think was a surprise to me and very very
exciting

14876
05:12:09,750 --> 05:12:09,760
exciting
 

14877
05:12:09,760 --> 05:12:11,750
exciting
uh to be able to see someone's brain who

14878
05:12:11,750 --> 05:12:11,760
uh to be able to see someone's brain who
 

14879
05:12:11,760 --> 05:12:13,430
uh to be able to see someone's brain who
you physically know and have talked with

14880
05:12:13,430 --> 05:12:13,440
you physically know and have talked with
 

14881
05:12:13,440 --> 05:12:15,150
you physically know and have talked with
that length actually pusing and moving

14882
05:12:15,150 --> 05:12:15,160
that length actually pusing and moving
 

14883
05:12:15,160 --> 05:12:16,670
that length actually pusing and moving
inside their skull and they used that

14884
05:12:16,670 --> 05:12:16,680
inside their skull and they used that
 

14885
05:12:16,680 --> 05:12:18,670
inside their skull and they used that
brain to talk to you previously and now

14886
05:12:18,670 --> 05:12:18,680
brain to talk to you previously and now
 

14887
05:12:18,680 --> 05:12:21,430
brain to talk to you previously and now
it's right there moving y uh actually I

14888
05:12:21,430 --> 05:12:21,440
it's right there moving y uh actually I
 

14889
05:12:21,440 --> 05:12:23,310
it's right there moving y uh actually I
didn't realize that in terms of the

14890
05:12:23,310 --> 05:12:23,320
didn't realize that in terms of the
 

14891
05:12:23,320 --> 05:12:26,150
didn't realize that in terms of the
thread sending so the the neuralink

14892
05:12:26,150 --> 05:12:26,160
thread sending so the the neuralink
 

14893
05:12:26,160 --> 05:12:28,670
thread sending so the the neuralink
implant is active during surgery so and

14894
05:12:28,670 --> 05:12:28,680
implant is active during surgery so and
 

14895
05:12:28,680 --> 05:12:30,708
implant is active during surgery so and
one thread at a time you're able to

14896
05:12:30,708 --> 05:12:30,718
one thread at a time you're able to
 

14897
05:12:30,718 --> 05:12:32,788
one thread at a time you're able to
start seeing the signal yeah so that's

14898
05:12:32,788 --> 05:12:32,798
start seeing the signal yeah so that's
 

14899
05:12:32,798 --> 05:12:34,310
start seeing the signal yeah so that's
part of the way you test that the thing

14900
05:12:34,310 --> 05:12:34,320
part of the way you test that the thing
 

14901
05:12:34,320 --> 05:12:36,470
part of the way you test that the thing
is working yeah so actually in the in

14902
05:12:36,470 --> 05:12:36,480
is working yeah so actually in the in
 

14903
05:12:36,480 --> 05:12:38,270
is working yeah so actually in the in
the operating room right after we sort

14904
05:12:38,270 --> 05:12:38,280
the operating room right after we sort
 

14905
05:12:38,280 --> 05:12:40,470
the operating room right after we sort
of um finished the all the thread

14906
05:12:40,470 --> 05:12:40,480
of um finished the all the thread
 

14907
05:12:40,480 --> 05:12:42,350
of um finished the all the thread
insertions I started collecting what's

14908
05:12:42,350 --> 05:12:42,360
insertions I started collecting what's
 

14909
05:12:42,360 --> 05:12:45,910
insertions I started collecting what's
called broadband data so Broadband is uh

14910
05:12:45,910 --> 05:12:45,920
called broadband data so Broadband is uh
 

14911
05:12:45,920 --> 05:12:47,230
called broadband data so Broadband is uh
basically the most raw form of signal

14912
05:12:47,230 --> 05:12:47,240
basically the most raw form of signal
 

14913
05:12:47,240 --> 05:12:49,310
basically the most raw form of signal
you can collect from a nurlink electrode

14914
05:12:49,310 --> 05:12:49,320
you can collect from a nurlink electrode
 

14915
05:12:49,320 --> 05:12:52,150
you can collect from a nurlink electrode
it's uh essentially a measurement of the

14916
05:12:52,150 --> 05:12:52,160
it's uh essentially a measurement of the
 

14917
05:12:52,160 --> 05:12:54,590
it's uh essentially a measurement of the
local field potential or the yeah the

14918
05:12:54,590 --> 05:12:54,600
local field potential or the yeah the
 

14919
05:12:54,600 --> 05:12:56,110
local field potential or the yeah the
voltage essentially measured by that

14920
05:12:56,110 --> 05:12:56,120
voltage essentially measured by that
 

14921
05:12:56,120 --> 05:12:58,390
voltage essentially measured by that
electrode and uh we have a certain mode

14922
05:12:58,390 --> 05:12:58,400
electrode and uh we have a certain mode
 

14923
05:12:58,400 --> 05:13:00,030
electrode and uh we have a certain mode
in our in our application that allows us

14924
05:13:00,030 --> 05:13:00,040
in our in our application that allows us
 

14925
05:13:00,040 --> 05:13:01,948
in our in our application that allows us
to visualize where detected spikes are

14926
05:13:01,948 --> 05:13:01,958
to visualize where detected spikes are
 

14927
05:13:01,958 --> 05:13:04,910
to visualize where detected spikes are
so it visualizes sort of where uh in the

14928
05:13:04,910 --> 05:13:04,920
so it visualizes sort of where uh in the
 

14929
05:13:04,920 --> 05:13:06,270
so it visualizes sort of where uh in the
Broadband signal in it's very very raw

14930
05:13:06,270 --> 05:13:06,280
Broadband signal in it's very very raw
 

14931
05:13:06,280 --> 05:13:08,110
Broadband signal in it's very very raw
form of the data a neuron is actually

14932
05:13:08,110 --> 05:13:08,120
form of the data a neuron is actually
 

14933
05:13:08,120 --> 05:13:11,070
form of the data a neuron is actually
spiking and so one of the these moments

14934
05:13:11,070 --> 05:13:11,080
spiking and so one of the these moments
 

14935
05:13:11,080 --> 05:13:12,470
spiking and so one of the these moments
that I'll never forget as part of this

14936
05:13:12,470 --> 05:13:12,480
that I'll never forget as part of this
 

14937
05:13:12,480 --> 05:13:14,590
that I'll never forget as part of this
whole clinical trial is seeing live in

14938
05:13:14,590 --> 05:13:14,600
whole clinical trial is seeing live in
 

14939
05:13:14,600 --> 05:13:16,070
whole clinical trial is seeing live in
the operating room while he's still

14940
05:13:16,070 --> 05:13:16,080
the operating room while he's still
 

14941
05:13:16,080 --> 05:13:18,310
the operating room while he's still
under anesthesia beautiful spikes being

14942
05:13:18,310 --> 05:13:18,320
under anesthesia beautiful spikes being
 

14943
05:13:18,320 --> 05:13:20,190
under anesthesia beautiful spikes being
shown in the application just streaming

14944
05:13:20,190 --> 05:13:20,200
shown in the application just streaming
 

14945
05:13:20,200 --> 05:13:22,548
shown in the application just streaming
live to a device I'm holding in my hand

14946
05:13:22,548 --> 05:13:22,558
live to a device I'm holding in my hand
 

14947
05:13:22,558 --> 05:13:24,750
live to a device I'm holding in my hand
so this is no signal processing the raw

14948
05:13:24,750 --> 05:13:24,760
so this is no signal processing the raw
 

14949
05:13:24,760 --> 05:13:26,510
so this is no signal processing the raw
data and then the signals processings on

14950
05:13:26,510 --> 05:13:26,520
data and then the signals processings on
 

14951
05:13:26,520 --> 05:13:27,990
data and then the signals processings on
top of it you're seeing the spikes

14952
05:13:27,990 --> 05:13:28,000
top of it you're seeing the spikes
 

14953
05:13:28,000 --> 05:13:29,830
top of it you're seeing the spikes
detected right

14954
05:13:29,830 --> 05:13:29,840
detected right
 

14955
05:13:29,840 --> 05:13:34,270
detected right
yeah and that's a ux too cuz that looks

14956
05:13:34,270 --> 05:13:34,280
yeah and that's a ux too cuz that looks
 

14957
05:13:34,280 --> 05:13:36,750
yeah and that's a ux too cuz that looks
beautiful as well during that procedure

14958
05:13:36,750 --> 05:13:36,760
beautiful as well during that procedure
 

14959
05:13:36,760 --> 05:13:37,990
beautiful as well during that procedure
there was actually a lot of cameramen in

14960
05:13:37,990 --> 05:13:38,000
there was actually a lot of cameramen in
 

14961
05:13:38,000 --> 05:13:39,910
there was actually a lot of cameramen in
the room so they also were curious and

14962
05:13:39,910 --> 05:13:39,920
the room so they also were curious and
 

14963
05:13:39,920 --> 05:13:40,910
the room so they also were curious and
wanted to see there's several

14964
05:13:40,910 --> 05:13:40,920
wanted to see there's several
 

14965
05:13:40,920 --> 05:13:42,270
wanted to see there's several
neurosurgeons in the room who are all

14966
05:13:42,270 --> 05:13:42,280
neurosurgeons in the room who are all
 

14967
05:13:42,280 --> 05:13:43,910
neurosurgeons in the room who are all
just excited to see robots taking their

14968
05:13:43,910 --> 05:13:43,920
just excited to see robots taking their
 

14969
05:13:43,920 --> 05:13:46,390
just excited to see robots taking their
job and uh they're all you know crowded

14970
05:13:46,390 --> 05:13:46,400
job and uh they're all you know crowded
 

14971
05:13:46,400 --> 05:13:47,990
job and uh they're all you know crowded
around a small little iPhone watching

14972
05:13:47,990 --> 05:13:48,000
around a small little iPhone watching
 

14973
05:13:48,000 --> 05:13:50,030
around a small little iPhone watching
this live brain data stream out of his

14974
05:13:50,030 --> 05:13:50,040
this live brain data stream out of his
 

14975
05:13:50,040 --> 05:13:52,390
this live brain data stream out of his
uh his brain what was that like seeing

14976
05:13:52,390 --> 05:13:52,400
uh his brain what was that like seeing
 

14977
05:13:52,400 --> 05:13:54,628
uh his brain what was that like seeing
the robot do some of the surgery so the

14978
05:13:54,628 --> 05:13:54,638
the robot do some of the surgery so the
 

14979
05:13:54,638 --> 05:13:56,390
the robot do some of the surgery so the
computer vision aspect where it detects

14980
05:13:56,390 --> 05:13:56,400
computer vision aspect where it detects
 

14981
05:13:56,400 --> 05:13:57,430
computer vision aspect where it detects
all

14982
05:13:57,430 --> 05:13:57,440
all
 

14983
05:13:57,440 --> 05:14:00,190
all
the all the spots that avoid the the

14984
05:14:00,190 --> 05:14:00,200
the all the spots that avoid the the
 

14985
05:14:00,200 --> 05:14:02,708
the all the spots that avoid the the
blood vessels and then obviously with

14986
05:14:02,708 --> 05:14:02,718
blood vessels and then obviously with
 

14987
05:14:02,718 --> 05:14:04,230
blood vessels and then obviously with
the human supervision then actually

14988
05:14:04,230 --> 05:14:04,240
the human supervision then actually
 

14989
05:14:04,240 --> 05:14:07,868
the human supervision then actually
doing the really high Precision uh

14990
05:14:07,868 --> 05:14:07,878
doing the really high Precision uh
 

14991
05:14:07,878 --> 05:14:10,910
doing the really high Precision uh
connection of the threads to the brain

14992
05:14:10,910 --> 05:14:10,920
connection of the threads to the brain
 

14993
05:14:10,920 --> 05:14:12,310
connection of the threads to the brain
yeah it's a good question my answer is

14994
05:14:12,310 --> 05:14:12,320
yeah it's a good question my answer is
 

14995
05:14:12,320 --> 05:14:13,990
yeah it's a good question my answer is
going to be uh pretty lame here but it

14996
05:14:13,990 --> 05:14:14,000
going to be uh pretty lame here but it
 

14997
05:14:14,000 --> 05:14:16,868
going to be uh pretty lame here but it
was boring yeah I've seen it uh so many

14998
05:14:16,868 --> 05:14:16,878
was boring yeah I've seen it uh so many
 

14999
05:14:16,878 --> 05:14:18,628
was boring yeah I've seen it uh so many
times yeah that's exactly how you want

15000
05:14:18,628 --> 05:14:18,638
times yeah that's exactly how you want
 

15001
05:14:18,638 --> 05:14:20,430
times yeah that's exactly how you want
surgery to be you want it to be boring

15002
05:14:20,430 --> 05:14:20,440
surgery to be you want it to be boring
 

15003
05:14:20,440 --> 05:14:22,350
surgery to be you want it to be boring
yeah because I've seen it so many times

15004
05:14:22,350 --> 05:14:22,360
yeah because I've seen it so many times
 

15005
05:14:22,360 --> 05:14:25,110
yeah because I've seen it so many times
I've seen the the robot do this surgery

15006
05:14:25,110 --> 05:14:25,120
I've seen the the robot do this surgery
 

15007
05:14:25,120 --> 05:14:27,548
I've seen the the robot do this surgery
literally hundreds of times and so it

15008
05:14:27,548 --> 05:14:27,558
literally hundreds of times and so it
 

15009
05:14:27,558 --> 05:14:29,948
literally hundreds of times and so it
was just one more time yeah all the

15010
05:14:29,948 --> 05:14:29,958
was just one more time yeah all the
 

15011
05:14:29,958 --> 05:14:32,628
was just one more time yeah all the
practice surgeries and the proxies and

15012
05:14:32,628 --> 05:14:32,638
practice surgeries and the proxies and
 

15013
05:14:32,638 --> 05:14:35,990
practice surgeries and the proxies and
this is just another day y so what about

15014
05:14:35,990 --> 05:14:36,000
this is just another day y so what about
 

15015
05:14:36,000 --> 05:14:38,510
this is just another day y so what about
when uh Nolan woke up well do do you

15016
05:14:38,510 --> 05:14:38,520
when uh Nolan woke up well do do you
 

15017
05:14:38,520 --> 05:14:39,548
when uh Nolan woke up well do do you
remember

15018
05:14:39,548 --> 05:14:39,558
remember
 

15019
05:14:39,558 --> 05:14:42,830
remember
a moment where uh he was able to move

15020
05:14:42,830 --> 05:14:42,840
a moment where uh he was able to move
 

15021
05:14:42,840 --> 05:14:45,230
a moment where uh he was able to move
the cursor not move the cursor but get

15022
05:14:45,230 --> 05:14:45,240
the cursor not move the cursor but get
 

15023
05:14:45,240 --> 05:14:46,990
the cursor not move the cursor but get
signal from the brain such that it was

15024
05:14:46,990 --> 05:14:47,000
signal from the brain such that it was
 

15025
05:14:47,000 --> 05:14:49,910
signal from the brain such that it was
able to show that there's a connection

15026
05:14:49,910 --> 05:14:49,920
able to show that there's a connection
 

15027
05:14:49,920 --> 05:14:52,670
able to show that there's a connection
yeah yeah so we are uh quite excited to

15028
05:14:52,670 --> 05:14:52,680
yeah yeah so we are uh quite excited to
 

15029
05:14:52,680 --> 05:14:54,430
yeah yeah so we are uh quite excited to
move as quickly as we can and Nolan was

15030
05:14:54,430 --> 05:14:54,440
move as quickly as we can and Nolan was
 

15031
05:14:54,440 --> 05:14:56,110
move as quickly as we can and Nolan was
really really excited to get started he

15032
05:14:56,110 --> 05:14:56,120
really really excited to get started he
 

15033
05:14:56,120 --> 05:14:57,350
really really excited to get started he
wanted to get started actually the day

15034
05:14:57,350 --> 05:14:57,360
wanted to get started actually the day
 

15035
05:14:57,360 --> 05:15:00,470
wanted to get started actually the day
of surgery but uh we we waited till the

15036
05:15:00,470 --> 05:15:00,480
of surgery but uh we we waited till the
 

15037
05:15:00,480 --> 05:15:02,788
of surgery but uh we we waited till the
next morning very patiently it's a long

15038
05:15:02,788 --> 05:15:02,798
next morning very patiently it's a long
 

15039
05:15:02,798 --> 05:15:06,270
next morning very patiently it's a long
night um and the next morning in the ICU

15040
05:15:06,270 --> 05:15:06,280
night um and the next morning in the ICU
 

15041
05:15:06,280 --> 05:15:09,628
night um and the next morning in the ICU
where he was uh recovering he uh wanted

15042
05:15:09,628 --> 05:15:09,638
where he was uh recovering he uh wanted
 

15043
05:15:09,638 --> 05:15:11,230
where he was uh recovering he uh wanted
to get started and actually start to

15044
05:15:11,230 --> 05:15:11,240
to get started and actually start to
 

15045
05:15:11,240 --> 05:15:12,628
to get started and actually start to
understand what kind of signal we could

15046
05:15:12,628 --> 05:15:12,638
understand what kind of signal we could
 

15047
05:15:12,638 --> 05:15:14,868
understand what kind of signal we could
measure from his brain and maybe for

15048
05:15:14,868 --> 05:15:14,878
measure from his brain and maybe for
 

15049
05:15:14,878 --> 05:15:16,990
measure from his brain and maybe for
folks who are not familiar with um the

15050
05:15:16,990 --> 05:15:17,000
folks who are not familiar with um the
 

15051
05:15:17,000 --> 05:15:18,708
folks who are not familiar with um the
neuralink system we implant the nurlink

15052
05:15:18,708 --> 05:15:18,718
neuralink system we implant the nurlink
 

15053
05:15:18,718 --> 05:15:20,390
neuralink system we implant the nurlink
system or the nurlink implant in the

15054
05:15:20,390 --> 05:15:20,400
system or the nurlink implant in the
 

15055
05:15:20,400 --> 05:15:22,310
system or the nurlink implant in the
motor cortex so the motor cortex is

15056
05:15:22,310 --> 05:15:22,320
motor cortex so the motor cortex is
 

15057
05:15:22,320 --> 05:15:24,230
motor cortex so the motor cortex is
responsible for representing things like

15058
05:15:24,230 --> 05:15:24,240
responsible for representing things like
 

15059
05:15:24,240 --> 05:15:27,150
responsible for representing things like
motor intent uh s if you imagine closing

15060
05:15:27,150 --> 05:15:27,160
motor intent uh s if you imagine closing
 

15061
05:15:27,160 --> 05:15:28,350
motor intent uh s if you imagine closing
and opening your hand that kind of

15062
05:15:28,350 --> 05:15:28,360
and opening your hand that kind of
 

15063
05:15:28,360 --> 05:15:29,788
and opening your hand that kind of
signal representation would be present

15064
05:15:29,788 --> 05:15:29,798
signal representation would be present
 

15065
05:15:29,798 --> 05:15:31,910
signal representation would be present
in the motor cortex if you imagine

15066
05:15:31,910 --> 05:15:31,920
in the motor cortex if you imagine
 

15067
05:15:31,920 --> 05:15:33,510
in the motor cortex if you imagine
moving your arm back and forth or

15068
05:15:33,510 --> 05:15:33,520
moving your arm back and forth or
 

15069
05:15:33,520 --> 05:15:35,350
moving your arm back and forth or
wiggling a pinky this sort of signal can

15070
05:15:35,350 --> 05:15:35,360
wiggling a pinky this sort of signal can
 

15071
05:15:35,360 --> 05:15:37,708
wiggling a pinky this sort of signal can
be present in the motor cortex so one of

15072
05:15:37,708 --> 05:15:37,718
be present in the motor cortex so one of
 

15073
05:15:37,718 --> 05:15:39,470
be present in the motor cortex so one of
the ways we start to sort of map out

15074
05:15:39,470 --> 05:15:39,480
the ways we start to sort of map out
 

15075
05:15:39,480 --> 05:15:40,830
the ways we start to sort of map out
what kind of signal do we actually have

15076
05:15:40,830 --> 05:15:40,840
what kind of signal do we actually have
 

15077
05:15:40,840 --> 05:15:42,510
what kind of signal do we actually have
access to in any particular individual's

15078
05:15:42,510 --> 05:15:42,520
access to in any particular individual's
 

15079
05:15:42,520 --> 05:15:43,868
access to in any particular individual's
brain is through this task called body

15080
05:15:43,868 --> 05:15:43,878
brain is through this task called body
 

15081
05:15:43,878 --> 05:15:45,750
brain is through this task called body
mapping and body mapping is where you

15082
05:15:45,750 --> 05:15:45,760
mapping and body mapping is where you
 

15083
05:15:45,760 --> 05:15:47,150
mapping and body mapping is where you
essentially present a visual to the user

15084
05:15:47,150 --> 05:15:47,160
essentially present a visual to the user
 

15085
05:15:47,160 --> 05:15:49,750
essentially present a visual to the user
and you say hey imagine doing this and

15086
05:15:49,750 --> 05:15:49,760
and you say hey imagine doing this and
 

15087
05:15:49,760 --> 05:15:52,230
and you say hey imagine doing this and
the visual is you know a 3d hand opening

15088
05:15:52,230 --> 05:15:52,240
the visual is you know a 3d hand opening
 

15089
05:15:52,240 --> 05:15:54,510
the visual is you know a 3d hand opening
and closing or index finger modulating

15090
05:15:54,510 --> 05:15:54,520
and closing or index finger modulating
 

15091
05:15:54,520 --> 05:15:56,868
and closing or index finger modulating
up and down and uh you ask the user to

15092
05:15:56,868 --> 05:15:56,878
up and down and uh you ask the user to
 

15093
05:15:56,878 --> 05:15:58,270
up and down and uh you ask the user to
imagine that and obviously you can't see

15094
05:15:58,270 --> 05:15:58,280
imagine that and obviously you can't see
 

15095
05:15:58,280 --> 05:15:59,868
imagine that and obviously you can't see
them do this because they're paralyzed

15096
05:15:59,868 --> 05:15:59,878
them do this because they're paralyzed
 

15097
05:15:59,878 --> 05:16:01,310
them do this because they're paralyzed
so you can't see them actually move

15098
05:16:01,310 --> 05:16:01,320
so you can't see them actually move
 

15099
05:16:01,320 --> 05:16:03,670
so you can't see them actually move
their arm but while they do this task

15100
05:16:03,670 --> 05:16:03,680
their arm but while they do this task
 

15101
05:16:03,680 --> 05:16:05,788
their arm but while they do this task
you can record neural activity and you

15102
05:16:05,788 --> 05:16:05,798
you can record neural activity and you
 

15103
05:16:05,798 --> 05:16:07,868
you can record neural activity and you
can basically offline model and check

15104
05:16:07,868 --> 05:16:07,878
can basically offline model and check
 

15105
05:16:07,878 --> 05:16:09,830
can basically offline model and check
can I predict or can I detect the

15106
05:16:09,830 --> 05:16:09,840
can I predict or can I detect the
 

15107
05:16:09,840 --> 05:16:11,110
can I predict or can I detect the
modulation corresponding with those

15108
05:16:11,110 --> 05:16:11,120
modulation corresponding with those
 

15109
05:16:11,120 --> 05:16:12,868
modulation corresponding with those
different actions and so we did that

15110
05:16:12,868 --> 05:16:12,878
different actions and so we did that
 

15111
05:16:12,878 --> 05:16:14,030
different actions and so we did that
task and we realized hey there's

15112
05:16:14,030 --> 05:16:14,040
task and we realized hey there's
 

15113
05:16:14,040 --> 05:16:15,910
task and we realized hey there's
actually some modulation associated with

15114
05:16:15,910 --> 05:16:15,920
actually some modulation associated with
 

15115
05:16:15,920 --> 05:16:17,510
actually some modulation associated with
some of his hand motion which was a

15116
05:16:17,510 --> 05:16:17,520
some of his hand motion which was a
 

15117
05:16:17,520 --> 05:16:19,110
some of his hand motion which was a
first indication that okay we can

15118
05:16:19,110 --> 05:16:19,120
first indication that okay we can
 

15119
05:16:19,120 --> 05:16:20,470
first indication that okay we can
potentially use that modulation to do

15120
05:16:20,470 --> 05:16:20,480
potentially use that modulation to do
 

15121
05:16:20,480 --> 05:16:22,310
potentially use that modulation to do
useful things in the world uh for

15122
05:16:22,310 --> 05:16:22,320
useful things in the world uh for
 

15123
05:16:22,320 --> 05:16:24,590
useful things in the world uh for
example control a computer cursor and he

15124
05:16:24,590 --> 05:16:24,600
example control a computer cursor and he
 

15125
05:16:24,600 --> 05:16:26,270
example control a computer cursor and he
started playing with it you know the

15126
05:16:26,270 --> 05:16:26,280
started playing with it you know the
 

15127
05:16:26,280 --> 05:16:27,310
started playing with it you know the
first time we showed him it and we

15128
05:16:27,310 --> 05:16:27,320
first time we showed him it and we
 

15129
05:16:27,320 --> 05:16:28,628
first time we showed him it and we
actually just took the same live view of

15130
05:16:28,628 --> 05:16:28,638
actually just took the same live view of
 

15131
05:16:28,638 --> 05:16:29,948
actually just took the same live view of
his brain activity and put it in front

15132
05:16:29,948 --> 05:16:29,958
his brain activity and put it in front
 

15133
05:16:29,958 --> 05:16:31,788
his brain activity and put it in front
of him and we said hey you tell us

15134
05:16:31,788 --> 05:16:31,798
of him and we said hey you tell us
 

15135
05:16:31,798 --> 05:16:33,628
of him and we said hey you tell us
what's going on uh you know we're not

15136
05:16:33,628 --> 05:16:33,638
what's going on uh you know we're not
 

15137
05:16:33,638 --> 05:16:35,830
what's going on uh you know we're not
you you're able to imagine different

15138
05:16:35,830 --> 05:16:35,840
you you're able to imagine different
 

15139
05:16:35,840 --> 05:16:37,310
you you're able to imagine different
things and we know that it's modulating

15140
05:16:37,310 --> 05:16:37,320
things and we know that it's modulating
 

15141
05:16:37,320 --> 05:16:38,670
things and we know that it's modulating
some of these neurons so you figure out

15142
05:16:38,670 --> 05:16:38,680
some of these neurons so you figure out
 

15143
05:16:38,680 --> 05:16:40,628
some of these neurons so you figure out
for for us what that is actually

15144
05:16:40,628 --> 05:16:40,638
for for us what that is actually
 

15145
05:16:40,638 --> 05:16:42,670
for for us what that is actually
representing and so he played with it

15146
05:16:42,670 --> 05:16:42,680
representing and so he played with it
 

15147
05:16:42,680 --> 05:16:43,948
representing and so he played with it
for a bit he was like I don't quite get

15148
05:16:43,948 --> 05:16:43,958
for a bit he was like I don't quite get
 

15149
05:16:43,958 --> 05:16:46,270
for a bit he was like I don't quite get
it yet he played for a bit longer and he

15150
05:16:46,270 --> 05:16:46,280
it yet he played for a bit longer and he
 

15151
05:16:46,280 --> 05:16:49,510
it yet he played for a bit longer and he
said oh when I move this finger I see

15152
05:16:49,510 --> 05:16:49,520
said oh when I move this finger I see
 

15153
05:16:49,520 --> 05:16:51,708
said oh when I move this finger I see
this particular Don start to fire more

15154
05:16:51,708 --> 05:16:51,718
this particular Don start to fire more
 

15155
05:16:51,718 --> 05:16:53,868
this particular Don start to fire more
and I said okay prove it do it again and

15156
05:16:53,868 --> 05:16:53,878
and I said okay prove it do it again and
 

15157
05:16:53,878 --> 05:16:57,070
and I said okay prove it do it again and
so he said okay 3 two 1 boom and the

15158
05:16:57,070 --> 05:16:57,080
so he said okay 3 two 1 boom and the
 

15159
05:16:57,080 --> 05:16:58,670
so he said okay 3 two 1 boom and the
minute he move you can see like

15160
05:16:58,670 --> 05:16:58,680
minute he move you can see like
 

15161
05:16:58,680 --> 05:17:00,830
minute he move you can see like
instantaneously this neuron is firing

15162
05:17:00,830 --> 05:17:00,840
instantaneously this neuron is firing
 

15163
05:17:00,840 --> 05:17:02,708
instantaneously this neuron is firing
single neuron I I can tell you the exact

15164
05:17:02,708 --> 05:17:02,718
single neuron I I can tell you the exact
 

15165
05:17:02,718 --> 05:17:04,510
single neuron I I can tell you the exact
channel number if you're interested it's

15166
05:17:04,510 --> 05:17:04,520
channel number if you're interested it's
 

15167
05:17:04,520 --> 05:17:06,390
channel number if you're interested it's
stuck in my brain now forever but that

15168
05:17:06,390 --> 05:17:06,400
stuck in my brain now forever but that
 

15169
05:17:06,400 --> 05:17:08,510
stuck in my brain now forever but that
single uh Channel firing was a beautiful

15170
05:17:08,510 --> 05:17:08,520
single uh Channel firing was a beautiful
 

15171
05:17:08,520 --> 05:17:09,990
single uh Channel firing was a beautiful
indication that it was behaviorally

15172
05:17:09,990 --> 05:17:10,000
indication that it was behaviorally
 

15173
05:17:10,000 --> 05:17:11,910
indication that it was behaviorally
modulated neural activity that could

15174
05:17:11,910 --> 05:17:11,920
modulated neural activity that could
 

15175
05:17:11,920 --> 05:17:13,628
modulated neural activity that could
then be used for Downstream tasks like

15176
05:17:13,628 --> 05:17:13,638
then be used for Downstream tasks like
 

15177
05:17:13,638 --> 05:17:15,350
then be used for Downstream tasks like
decoding a computer cursor and when you

15178
05:17:15,350 --> 05:17:15,360
decoding a computer cursor and when you
 

15179
05:17:15,360 --> 05:17:16,910
decoding a computer cursor and when you
say single channel is that associated

15180
05:17:16,910 --> 05:17:16,920
say single channel is that associated
 

15181
05:17:16,920 --> 05:17:19,590
say single channel is that associated
with a single electrode yeah so Channel

15182
05:17:19,590 --> 05:17:19,600
with a single electrode yeah so Channel
 

15183
05:17:19,600 --> 05:17:20,948
with a single electrode yeah so Channel
electrode are interchangeable and

15184
05:17:20,948 --> 05:17:20,958
electrode are interchangeable and
 

15185
05:17:20,958 --> 05:17:25,708
electrode are interchangeable and
there's a 1,24 of those 1,24 yeah it's

15186
05:17:25,708 --> 05:17:25,718
there's a 1,24 of those 1,24 yeah it's
 

15187
05:17:25,718 --> 05:17:28,070
there's a 1,24 of those 1,24 yeah it's
incredible that that works that really

15188
05:17:28,070 --> 05:17:28,080
incredible that that works that really
 

15189
05:17:28,080 --> 05:17:31,190
incredible that that works that really
when I was um learning about all this

15190
05:17:31,190 --> 05:17:31,200
when I was um learning about all this
 

15191
05:17:31,200 --> 05:17:33,910
when I was um learning about all this
and like loading it in it was just

15192
05:17:33,910 --> 05:17:33,920
and like loading it in it was just
 

15193
05:17:33,920 --> 05:17:36,270
and like loading it in it was just
blowing my mind that the intention you

15194
05:17:36,270 --> 05:17:36,280
blowing my mind that the intention you
 

15195
05:17:36,280 --> 05:17:39,948
blowing my mind that the intention you
can visualize yourself moving the finger

15196
05:17:39,948 --> 05:17:39,958
can visualize yourself moving the finger
 

15197
05:17:39,958 --> 05:17:41,990
can visualize yourself moving the finger
that can turn into a signal and the fact

15198
05:17:41,990 --> 05:17:42,000
that can turn into a signal and the fact
 

15199
05:17:42,000 --> 05:17:43,868
that can turn into a signal and the fact
that you can then skip that step and

15200
05:17:43,868 --> 05:17:43,878
that you can then skip that step and
 

15201
05:17:43,878 --> 05:17:47,310
that you can then skip that step and
visualize the cursor moving or have the

15202
05:17:47,310 --> 05:17:47,320
visualize the cursor moving or have the
 

15203
05:17:47,320 --> 05:17:49,548
visualize the cursor moving or have the
intention of the cursor moving and that

15204
05:17:49,548 --> 05:17:49,558
intention of the cursor moving and that
 

15205
05:17:49,558 --> 05:17:51,190
intention of the cursor moving and that
leading to a signal that can then be

15206
05:17:51,190 --> 05:17:51,200
leading to a signal that can then be
 

15207
05:17:51,200 --> 05:17:54,670
leading to a signal that can then be
used to move the cursor this there is so

15208
05:17:54,670 --> 05:17:54,680
used to move the cursor this there is so
 

15209
05:17:54,680 --> 05:17:56,590
used to move the cursor this there is so
many exciting things there to learn

15210
05:17:56,590 --> 05:17:56,600
many exciting things there to learn
 

15211
05:17:56,600 --> 05:17:58,190
many exciting things there to learn
about the brain about the way the brain

15212
05:17:58,190 --> 05:17:58,200
about the brain about the way the brain
 

15213
05:17:58,200 --> 05:18:00,948
about the brain about the way the brain
works the very fact of their existing

15214
05:18:00,948 --> 05:18:00,958
works the very fact of their existing
 

15215
05:18:00,958 --> 05:18:02,390
works the very fact of their existing
signal that can be used is really

15216
05:18:02,390 --> 05:18:02,400
signal that can be used is really
 

15217
05:18:02,400 --> 05:18:04,750
signal that can be used is really
powerful yep but it feels like that's

15218
05:18:04,750 --> 05:18:04,760
powerful yep but it feels like that's
 

15219
05:18:04,760 --> 05:18:06,548
powerful yep but it feels like that's
just like the beginning of figuring out

15220
05:18:06,548 --> 05:18:06,558
just like the beginning of figuring out
 

15221
05:18:06,558 --> 05:18:08,150
just like the beginning of figuring out
how that signal could be used really

15222
05:18:08,150 --> 05:18:08,160
how that signal could be used really
 

15223
05:18:08,160 --> 05:18:10,708
how that signal could be used really
really effectively

15224
05:18:10,708 --> 05:18:10,718
really effectively
 

15225
05:18:10,718 --> 05:18:12,230
really effectively
I should also just uh there's so many

15226
05:18:12,230 --> 05:18:12,240
I should also just uh there's so many
 

15227
05:18:12,240 --> 05:18:13,590
I should also just uh there's so many
fascinating details here but you

15228
05:18:13,590 --> 05:18:13,600
fascinating details here but you
 

15229
05:18:13,600 --> 05:18:16,910
fascinating details here but you
mentioned the body mapping step uh at

15230
05:18:16,910 --> 05:18:16,920
mentioned the body mapping step uh at
 

15231
05:18:16,920 --> 05:18:19,628
mentioned the body mapping step uh at
least in the version I saw that Nolan

15232
05:18:19,628 --> 05:18:19,638
least in the version I saw that Nolan
 

15233
05:18:19,638 --> 05:18:21,830
least in the version I saw that Nolan
was showing off there's like a super

15234
05:18:21,830 --> 05:18:21,840
was showing off there's like a super
 

15235
05:18:21,840 --> 05:18:23,708
was showing off there's like a super
nice interface like a graphical

15236
05:18:23,708 --> 05:18:23,718
nice interface like a graphical
 

15237
05:18:23,718 --> 05:18:25,628
nice interface like a graphical
interface but like it just felt like I

15238
05:18:25,628 --> 05:18:25,638
interface but like it just felt like I
 

15239
05:18:25,638 --> 05:18:28,190
interface but like it just felt like I
was like in the future cuz it it like uh

15240
05:18:28,190 --> 05:18:28,200
was like in the future cuz it it like uh
 

15241
05:18:28,200 --> 05:18:30,628
was like in the future cuz it it like uh
you know I guess it visualizes you

15242
05:18:30,628 --> 05:18:30,638
you know I guess it visualizes you
 

15243
05:18:30,638 --> 05:18:34,190
you know I guess it visualizes you
moving the hand and there's a very like

15244
05:18:34,190 --> 05:18:34,200
moving the hand and there's a very like
 

15245
05:18:34,200 --> 05:18:38,030
moving the hand and there's a very like
like a sexy polished interface that that

15246
05:18:38,030 --> 05:18:38,040
like a sexy polished interface that that
 

15247
05:18:38,040 --> 05:18:39,868
like a sexy polished interface that that
hello yeah I don't know if there's a

15248
05:18:39,868 --> 05:18:39,878
hello yeah I don't know if there's a
 

15249
05:18:39,878 --> 05:18:42,708
hello yeah I don't know if there's a
voice component but it just felt like uh

15250
05:18:42,708 --> 05:18:42,718
voice component but it just felt like uh
 

15251
05:18:42,718 --> 05:18:44,868
voice component but it just felt like uh
it's like when you wake up in a really

15252
05:18:44,868 --> 05:18:44,878
it's like when you wake up in a really
 

15253
05:18:44,878 --> 05:18:46,548
it's like when you wake up in a really
nice video game and this is a tutorial

15254
05:18:46,548 --> 05:18:46,558
nice video game and this is a tutorial
 

15255
05:18:46,558 --> 05:18:48,510
nice video game and this is a tutorial
at the beginning of that video game this

15256
05:18:48,510 --> 05:18:48,520
at the beginning of that video game this
 

15257
05:18:48,520 --> 05:18:50,510
at the beginning of that video game this
is what you're supposed to do it's cool

15258
05:18:50,510 --> 05:18:50,520
is what you're supposed to do it's cool
 

15259
05:18:50,520 --> 05:18:51,670
is what you're supposed to do it's cool
no I mean the future should feel like

15260
05:18:51,670 --> 05:18:51,680
no I mean the future should feel like
 

15261
05:18:51,680 --> 05:18:53,310
no I mean the future should feel like
the future but it's not easy to pull

15262
05:18:53,310 --> 05:18:53,320
the future but it's not easy to pull
 

15263
05:18:53,320 --> 05:18:55,750
the future but it's not easy to pull
that off I mean it needs to be simple

15264
05:18:55,750 --> 05:18:55,760
that off I mean it needs to be simple
 

15265
05:18:55,760 --> 05:18:58,390
that off I mean it needs to be simple
but not too simple yeah and I think the

15266
05:18:58,390 --> 05:18:58,400
but not too simple yeah and I think the
 

15267
05:18:58,400 --> 05:19:00,510
but not too simple yeah and I think the
ux design component here is uh

15268
05:19:00,510 --> 05:19:00,520
ux design component here is uh
 

15269
05:19:00,520 --> 05:19:02,750
ux design component here is uh
underrated for BCI uh development and

15270
05:19:02,750 --> 05:19:02,760
underrated for BCI uh development and
 

15271
05:19:02,760 --> 05:19:05,708
underrated for BCI uh development and
general there's a whole interaction

15272
05:19:05,708 --> 05:19:05,718
general there's a whole interaction
 

15273
05:19:05,718 --> 05:19:07,030
general there's a whole interaction
effect between the ways in which you

15274
05:19:07,030 --> 05:19:07,040
effect between the ways in which you
 

15275
05:19:07,040 --> 05:19:09,670
effect between the ways in which you
visualize uh an instruction to the user

15276
05:19:09,670 --> 05:19:09,680
visualize uh an instruction to the user
 

15277
05:19:09,680 --> 05:19:11,390
visualize uh an instruction to the user
and the kinds of signal you can get back

15278
05:19:11,390 --> 05:19:11,400
and the kinds of signal you can get back
 

15279
05:19:11,400 --> 05:19:12,750
and the kinds of signal you can get back
and that quality of sort of your

15280
05:19:12,750 --> 05:19:12,760
and that quality of sort of your
 

15281
05:19:12,760 --> 05:19:14,110
and that quality of sort of your
behavioral alignment to the neural

15282
05:19:14,110 --> 05:19:14,120
behavioral alignment to the neural
 

15283
05:19:14,120 --> 05:19:16,070
behavioral alignment to the neural
signal is a function of how good you are

15284
05:19:16,070 --> 05:19:16,080
signal is a function of how good you are
 

15285
05:19:16,080 --> 05:19:17,270
signal is a function of how good you are
at expressing to the user what you want

15286
05:19:17,270 --> 05:19:17,280
at expressing to the user what you want
 

15287
05:19:17,280 --> 05:19:19,270
at expressing to the user what you want
them to do and so yeah we spend a lot of

15288
05:19:19,270 --> 05:19:19,280
them to do and so yeah we spend a lot of
 

15289
05:19:19,280 --> 05:19:21,510
them to do and so yeah we spend a lot of
time thinking about the ux uh of how we

15290
05:19:21,510 --> 05:19:21,520
time thinking about the ux uh of how we
 

15291
05:19:21,520 --> 05:19:22,708
time thinking about the ux uh of how we
build our applications of how the

15292
05:19:22,708 --> 05:19:22,718
build our applications of how the
 

15293
05:19:22,718 --> 05:19:24,230
build our applications of how the
decoder actually functions the control

15294
05:19:24,230 --> 05:19:24,240
decoder actually functions the control
 

15295
05:19:24,240 --> 05:19:26,030
decoder actually functions the control
surfaces it provides to the user all

15296
05:19:26,030 --> 05:19:26,040
surfaces it provides to the user all
 

15297
05:19:26,040 --> 05:19:27,788
surfaces it provides to the user all
these little Details Matter a lot so

15298
05:19:27,788 --> 05:19:27,798
these little Details Matter a lot so
 

15299
05:19:27,798 --> 05:19:29,390
these little Details Matter a lot so
maybe it'd be nice to get into a little

15300
05:19:29,390 --> 05:19:29,400
maybe it'd be nice to get into a little
 

15301
05:19:29,400 --> 05:19:32,110
maybe it'd be nice to get into a little
bit more detail of what the signal looks

15302
05:19:32,110 --> 05:19:32,120
bit more detail of what the signal looks
 

15303
05:19:32,120 --> 05:19:34,430
bit more detail of what the signal looks
like and what the decoding looks like so

15304
05:19:34,430 --> 05:19:34,440
like and what the decoding looks like so
 

15305
05:19:34,440 --> 05:19:38,788
like and what the decoding looks like so
there's a uh N1 implant

15306
05:19:38,788 --> 05:19:38,798
there's a uh N1 implant
 

15307
05:19:38,798 --> 05:19:42,788
there's a uh N1 implant
that has like we mentioned uh 1,24

15308
05:19:42,788 --> 05:19:42,798
that has like we mentioned uh 1,24
 

15309
05:19:42,798 --> 05:19:45,628
that has like we mentioned uh 1,24
electrodes and that's collecting raw

15310
05:19:45,628 --> 05:19:45,638
electrodes and that's collecting raw
 

15311
05:19:45,638 --> 05:19:47,548
electrodes and that's collecting raw
data raw signal what does that signal

15312
05:19:47,548 --> 05:19:47,558
data raw signal what does that signal
 

15313
05:19:47,558 --> 05:19:50,270
data raw signal what does that signal
look like and uh what are the different

15314
05:19:50,270 --> 05:19:50,280
look like and uh what are the different
 

15315
05:19:50,280 --> 05:19:52,350
look like and uh what are the different
steps along the way before it's

15316
05:19:52,350 --> 05:19:52,360
steps along the way before it's
 

15317
05:19:52,360 --> 05:19:54,708
steps along the way before it's
transmitted and what is transmitted all

15318
05:19:54,708 --> 05:19:54,718
transmitted and what is transmitted all
 

15319
05:19:54,718 --> 05:19:56,788
transmitted and what is transmitted all
that kind of stuff yeah Yep this is

15320
05:19:56,788 --> 05:19:56,798
that kind of stuff yeah Yep this is
 

15321
05:19:56,798 --> 05:20:00,830
that kind of stuff yeah Yep this is
going to be a fun one let's go uh so uh

15322
05:20:00,830 --> 05:20:00,840
going to be a fun one let's go uh so uh
 

15323
05:20:00,840 --> 05:20:02,990
going to be a fun one let's go uh so uh
maybe before diving into what we do it's

15324
05:20:02,990 --> 05:20:03,000
maybe before diving into what we do it's
 

15325
05:20:03,000 --> 05:20:04,150
maybe before diving into what we do it's
worth understanding what we're trying to

15326
05:20:04,150 --> 05:20:04,160
worth understanding what we're trying to
 

15327
05:20:04,160 --> 05:20:06,270
worth understanding what we're trying to
measure because uh that dictates a lot

15328
05:20:06,270 --> 05:20:06,280
measure because uh that dictates a lot
 

15329
05:20:06,280 --> 05:20:07,830
measure because uh that dictates a lot
of the requirements for the system that

15330
05:20:07,830 --> 05:20:07,840
of the requirements for the system that
 

15331
05:20:07,840 --> 05:20:09,548
of the requirements for the system that
we build and what we're trying to

15332
05:20:09,548 --> 05:20:09,558
we build and what we're trying to
 

15333
05:20:09,558 --> 05:20:11,390
we build and what we're trying to
measure is really individual neurons

15334
05:20:11,390 --> 05:20:11,400
measure is really individual neurons
 

15335
05:20:11,400 --> 05:20:12,948
measure is really individual neurons
producing action potentials an action

15336
05:20:12,948 --> 05:20:12,958
producing action potentials an action
 

15337
05:20:12,958 --> 05:20:15,110
producing action potentials an action
potential is you can think of it like a

15338
05:20:15,110 --> 05:20:15,120
potential is you can think of it like a
 

15339
05:20:15,120 --> 05:20:17,788
potential is you can think of it like a
little electrical impulse that you can

15340
05:20:17,788 --> 05:20:17,798
little electrical impulse that you can
 

15341
05:20:17,798 --> 05:20:19,788
little electrical impulse that you can
uh detect if you're close enough and by

15342
05:20:19,788 --> 05:20:19,798
uh detect if you're close enough and by
 

15343
05:20:19,798 --> 05:20:21,868
uh detect if you're close enough and by
being close enough I mean like within

15344
05:20:21,868 --> 05:20:21,878
being close enough I mean like within
 

15345
05:20:21,878 --> 05:20:24,548
being close enough I mean like within
let's say 100 microns of that cell and

15346
05:20:24,548 --> 05:20:24,558
let's say 100 microns of that cell and
 

15347
05:20:24,558 --> 05:20:26,430
let's say 100 microns of that cell and
100 microns is a very very tiny distance

15348
05:20:26,430 --> 05:20:26,440
100 microns is a very very tiny distance
 

15349

05:20:29,230 --> 05:20:29,240
and so the number of neurons that you're
 

15351
05:20:29,240 --> 05:20:30,190
and so the number of neurons that you're
going to pick up with any given

for sort of the engineering side of

15498
05:23:04,070 --> 05:23:04,080
for sort of the engineering side of
 

15499
05:23:04,080 --> 05:23:06,310
for sort of the engineering side of
things at least at the current scale if

15500
05:23:06,310 --> 05:23:06,320
things at least at the current scale if
 

15501
05:23:06,320 --> 05:23:08,868
things at least at the current scale if
the number of neurons per electrode is

15502
05:23:08,868 --> 05:23:08,878
the number of neurons per electrode is
 

15503
05:23:08,878 --> 05:23:11,150
the number of neurons per electrode is
relatively small you can get away with

15504
05:23:11,150 --> 05:23:11,160
relatively small you can get away with
 

15505
05:23:11,160 --> 05:23:12,150
relatively small you can get away with
basically ignoring that problem

15506
05:23:12,150 --> 05:23:12,160
basically ignoring that problem
 

15507
05:23:12,160 --> 05:23:14,070
basically ignoring that problem
completely you can think of it like sort

15508
05:23:14,070 --> 05:23:14,080
completely you can think of it like sort
 

15509
05:23:14,080 --> 05:23:15,948
completely you can think of it like sort
of a random projection of neurons to

15510
05:23:15,948 --> 05:23:15,958
of a random projection of neurons to
 

15511
05:23:15,958 --> 05:23:17,868
of a random projection of neurons to
electrodes and there may be in some

15512
05:23:17,868 --> 05:23:17,878
electrodes and there may be in some
 

15513
05:23:17,878 --> 05:23:19,548
electrodes and there may be in some
cases more than one neuron per electrode

15514
05:23:19,548 --> 05:23:19,558
cases more than one neuron per electrode
 

15515
05:23:19,558 --> 05:23:21,190
cases more than one neuron per electrode
but if that number is small enough those

15516
05:23:21,190 --> 05:23:21,200
but if that number is small enough those
 

15517
05:23:21,200 --> 05:23:23,948
but if that number is small enough those
signals can be thought of as uh sort of

15518
05:23:23,948 --> 05:23:23,958
signals can be thought of as uh sort of
 

15519
05:23:23,958 --> 05:23:25,830
signals can be thought of as uh sort of
a union of the two and for many

15520
05:23:25,830 --> 05:23:25,840
a union of the two and for many
 

15521
05:23:25,840 --> 05:23:27,270
a union of the two and for many
applications that's a totally reasonable

15522
05:23:27,270 --> 05:23:27,280
applications that's a totally reasonable
 

15523
05:23:27,280 --> 05:23:28,708
applications that's a totally reasonable
trade-off to make and can simplify the

15524
05:23:28,708 --> 05:23:28,718
trade-off to make and can simplify the
 

15525
05:23:28,718 --> 05:23:31,110
trade-off to make and can simplify the
problem a lot and as you sort of scale

15526
05:23:31,110 --> 05:23:31,120
problem a lot and as you sort of scale
 

15527
05:23:31,120 --> 05:23:33,590
problem a lot and as you sort of scale
out Channel count the uh relevance of

15528
05:23:33,590 --> 05:23:33,600
out Channel count the uh relevance of
 

15529
05:23:33,600 --> 05:23:34,910
out Channel count the uh relevance of
distinguishing individual neurons

15530
05:23:34,910 --> 05:23:34,920
distinguishing individual neurons
 

15531
05:23:34,920 --> 05:23:36,190
distinguishing individual neurons
becomes less important because you have

15532
05:23:36,190 --> 05:23:36,200
becomes less important because you have
 

15533
05:23:36,200 --> 05:23:37,910
becomes less important because you have
more overall signal and you can start to

15534
05:23:37,910 --> 05:23:37,920
more overall signal and you can start to
 

15535
05:23:37,920 --> 05:23:39,030
more overall signal and you can start to
rely and sort of

15536
05:23:39,030 --> 05:23:39,040
rely and sort of
 

15537
05:23:39,040 --> 05:23:40,708
rely and sort of
correlations or coari structure in the

15538
05:23:40,708 --> 05:23:40,718
correlations or coari structure in the
 

15539
05:23:40,718 --> 05:23:42,190
correlations or coari structure in the
data to help understand when that

15540
05:23:42,190 --> 05:23:42,200
data to help understand when that
 

15541
05:23:42,200 --> 05:23:44,110
data to help understand when that
channel is firing what does that what

15542
05:23:44,110 --> 05:23:44,120
channel is firing what does that what
 

15543
05:23:44,120 --> 05:23:45,868
channel is firing what does that what
does that actually represent because you

15544
05:23:45,868 --> 05:23:45,878
does that actually represent because you
 

15545
05:23:45,878 --> 05:23:47,350
does that actually represent because you
know that when that channel is firing in

15546
05:23:47,350 --> 05:23:47,360
know that when that channel is firing in
 

15547
05:23:47,360 --> 05:23:49,350
know that when that channel is firing in
concert with these other 50 channels

15548
05:23:49,350 --> 05:23:49,360
concert with these other 50 channels
 

15549
05:23:49,360 --> 05:23:51,030
concert with these other 50 channels
that means move left but when that same

15550
05:23:51,030 --> 05:23:51,040
that means move left but when that same
 

15551
05:23:51,040 --> 05:23:52,150
that means move left but when that same
channel is firing with concert with

15552
05:23:52,150 --> 05:23:52,160
channel is firing with concert with
 

15553
05:23:52,160 --> 05:23:53,548
channel is firing with concert with
these other 10 channels that means move

15554
05:23:53,548 --> 05:23:53,558
these other 10 channels that means move
 

15555
05:23:53,558 --> 05:23:55,150
these other 10 channels that means move
right okay so you have to do this kind

15556
05:23:55,150 --> 05:23:55,160
right okay so you have to do this kind
 

15557
05:23:55,160 --> 05:23:58,150
right okay so you have to do this kind
of Spike detection on

15558
05:23:58,150 --> 05:23:58,160
of Spike detection on
 

15559
05:23:58,160 --> 05:24:00,548
of Spike detection on
board and you have to do that super

15560
05:24:00,548 --> 05:24:00,558
board and you have to do that super
 

15561
05:24:00,558 --> 05:24:03,708
board and you have to do that super
efficiently so fast and not use too much

15562
05:24:03,708 --> 05:24:03,718
efficiently so fast and not use too much
 

15563
05:24:03,718 --> 05:24:04,868
efficiently so fast and not use too much
power because you don't want to be

15564
05:24:04,868 --> 05:24:04,878
power because you don't want to be
 

15565
05:24:04,878 --> 05:24:06,230
power because you don't want to be
generating too much heat so it have to

15566
05:24:06,230 --> 05:24:06,240
generating too much heat so it have to
 

15567
05:24:06,240 --> 05:24:09,590
generating too much heat so it have to
be a super simple signal processing step

15568
05:24:09,590 --> 05:24:09,600
be a super simple signal processing step
 

15569
05:24:09,600 --> 05:24:14,110
be a super simple signal processing step
yeah um is there some wisdom you can

15570
05:24:14,110 --> 05:24:14,120
yeah um is there some wisdom you can
 

15571
05:24:14,120 --> 05:24:16,350
yeah um is there some wisdom you can
share about what it takes to overcome

15572
05:24:16,350 --> 05:24:16,360
share about what it takes to overcome
 

15573
05:24:16,360 --> 05:24:19,430
share about what it takes to overcome
that challenge yeah so we've tried many

15574
05:24:19,430 --> 05:24:19,440
that challenge yeah so we've tried many
 

15575
05:24:19,440 --> 05:24:21,470
that challenge yeah so we've tried many
different versions of basically turning

15576
05:24:21,470 --> 05:24:21,480
different versions of basically turning
 

15577
05:24:21,480 --> 05:24:23,948
different versions of basically turning
this raw signal into uh sort of a

15578
05:24:23,948 --> 05:24:23,958
this raw signal into uh sort of a
 

15579
05:24:23,958 --> 05:24:25,070
this raw signal into uh sort of a
feature that you might want to send off

15580
05:24:25,070 --> 05:24:25,080
feature that you might want to send off
 

15581
05:24:25,080 --> 05:24:26,910
feature that you might want to send off
the device and I'll say that I don't

15582
05:24:26,910 --> 05:24:26,920
the device and I'll say that I don't
 

15583
05:24:26,920 --> 05:24:28,310
the device and I'll say that I don't
think we're at the final step of this

15584
05:24:28,310 --> 05:24:28,320
think we're at the final step of this
 

15585
05:24:28,320 --> 05:24:30,030
think we're at the final step of this
process this is a long journey we have

15586
05:24:30,030 --> 05:24:30,040
process this is a long journey we have
 

15587
05:24:30,040 --> 05:24:32,350
process this is a long journey we have
something that works clearly today but

15588
05:24:32,350 --> 05:24:32,360
something that works clearly today but
 

15589
05:24:32,360 --> 05:24:33,548
something that works clearly today but
there can be many approaches that we

15590
05:24:33,548 --> 05:24:33,558
there can be many approaches that we
 

15591
05:24:33,558 --> 05:24:34,628
there can be many approaches that we
find in the future that are much better

15592
05:24:34,628 --> 05:24:34,638
find in the future that are much better
 

15593
05:24:34,638 --> 05:24:37,030
find in the future that are much better
than what we do right now so some

15594
05:24:37,030 --> 05:24:37,040
than what we do right now so some
 

15595
05:24:37,040 --> 05:24:38,590
than what we do right now so some
versions of what we do right now and

15596
05:24:38,590 --> 05:24:38,600
versions of what we do right now and
 

15597
05:24:38,600 --> 05:24:40,750
versions of what we do right now and
there's a lot of academic her to these

15598
05:24:40,750 --> 05:24:40,760
there's a lot of academic her to these
 

15599
05:24:40,760 --> 05:24:42,030
there's a lot of academic her to these
ideas so I don't want to you know claim

15600
05:24:42,030 --> 05:24:42,040
ideas so I don't want to you know claim
 

15601
05:24:42,040 --> 05:24:43,628
ideas so I don't want to you know claim
that these are original nurlink ideas or

15602
05:24:43,628 --> 05:24:43,638
that these are original nurlink ideas or
 

15603
05:24:43,638 --> 05:24:45,628
that these are original nurlink ideas or
anything like that but uh one of these

15604
05:24:45,628 --> 05:24:45,638
anything like that but uh one of these
 

15605
05:24:45,638 --> 05:24:47,990
anything like that but uh one of these
ideas is basically to build a sort of

15606
05:24:47,990 --> 05:24:48,000
ideas is basically to build a sort of
 

15607
05:24:48,000 --> 05:24:49,350
ideas is basically to build a sort of
like a convolutional filter almost if

15608
05:24:49,350 --> 05:24:49,360
like a convolutional filter almost if
 

15609
05:24:49,360 --> 05:24:51,030
like a convolutional filter almost if
you will that slides across the signal

15610
05:24:51,030 --> 05:24:51,040
you will that slides across the signal
 

15611
05:24:51,040 --> 05:24:53,510
you will that slides across the signal
and looks for a certain template to be

15612
05:24:53,510 --> 05:24:53,520
and looks for a certain template to be
 

15613
05:24:53,520 --> 05:24:55,310
and looks for a certain template to be
matched that template consists of sort

15614
05:24:55,310 --> 05:24:55,320
matched that template consists of sort
 

15615
05:24:55,320 --> 05:24:58,548
matched that template consists of sort
of How deep the spike modulates how much

15616
05:24:58,548 --> 05:24:58,558
of How deep the spike modulates how much
 

15617
05:24:58,558 --> 05:25:00,110
of How deep the spike modulates how much
it recovers and what the duration and

15618
05:25:00,110 --> 05:25:00,120
it recovers and what the duration and
 

15619
05:25:00,120 --> 05:25:02,030
it recovers and what the duration and
window of time is that the whole process

15620
05:25:02,030 --> 05:25:02,040
window of time is that the whole process
 

15621
05:25:02,040 --> 05:25:03,990
window of time is that the whole process
takes and if you can see in the signal

15622
05:25:03,990 --> 05:25:04,000
takes and if you can see in the signal
 

15623
05:25:04,000 --> 05:25:05,350
takes and if you can see in the signal
that that template is matched within

15624
05:25:05,350 --> 05:25:05,360
that that template is matched within
 

15625
05:25:05,360 --> 05:25:07,350
that that template is matched within
certain bounds then you can say okay

15626
05:25:07,350 --> 05:25:07,360
certain bounds then you can say okay
 

15627
05:25:07,360 --> 05:25:09,390
certain bounds then you can say okay
that's a spike one reason that approach

15628
05:25:09,390 --> 05:25:09,400
that's a spike one reason that approach
 

15629
05:25:09,400 --> 05:25:11,150
that's a spike one reason that approach
is super convenient is that you can

15630
05:25:11,150 --> 05:25:11,160
is super convenient is that you can
 

15631
05:25:11,160 --> 05:25:13,350
is super convenient is that you can
actually Implement that extremely

15632
05:25:13,350 --> 05:25:13,360
actually Implement that extremely
 

15633
05:25:13,360 --> 05:25:15,270
actually Implement that extremely
efficiently in Hardware which means that

15634
05:25:15,270 --> 05:25:15,280
efficiently in Hardware which means that
 

15635
05:25:15,280 --> 05:25:17,990
efficiently in Hardware which means that
you can run it uh in low power across

15636
05:25:17,990 --> 05:25:18,000
you can run it uh in low power across
 

15637
05:25:18,000 --> 05:25:20,788
you can run it uh in low power across
1,24 channels all at once another

15638
05:25:20,788 --> 05:25:20,798
1,24 channels all at once another
 

15639
05:25:20,798 --> 05:25:22,750
1,24 channels all at once another
approach that we've recently started uh

15640
05:25:22,750 --> 05:25:22,760
approach that we've recently started uh
 

15641
05:25:22,760 --> 05:25:24,510
approach that we've recently started uh
exploring and this can be combined with

15642
05:25:24,510 --> 05:25:24,520
exploring and this can be combined with
 

15643
05:25:24,520 --> 05:25:26,270
exploring and this can be combined with
the spike detection approach something

15644
05:25:26,270 --> 05:25:26,280
the spike detection approach something
 

15645
05:25:26,280 --> 05:25:28,110
the spike detection approach something
called Spike band power and the benefits

15646
05:25:28,110 --> 05:25:28,120
called Spike band power and the benefits
 

15647
05:25:28,120 --> 05:25:29,830
called Spike band power and the benefits
of that approach are that you may be

15648
05:25:29,830 --> 05:25:29,840
of that approach are that you may be
 

15649
05:25:29,840 --> 05:25:32,150
of that approach are that you may be
able to pick up some signal from neurons

15650
05:25:32,150 --> 05:25:32,160
able to pick up some signal from neurons
 

15651
05:25:32,160 --> 05:25:33,350
able to pick up some signal from neurons
that are maybe too far away to be

15652
05:25:33,350 --> 05:25:33,360
that are maybe too far away to be
 

15653
05:25:33,360 --> 05:25:35,350
that are maybe too far away to be
detected as a spike because the farther

15654
05:25:35,350 --> 05:25:35,360
detected as a spike because the farther
 

15655
05:25:35,360 --> 05:25:36,788
detected as a spike because the farther
away you are from an electrode the

15656
05:25:36,788 --> 05:25:36,798
away you are from an electrode the
 

15657
05:25:36,798 --> 05:25:38,910
away you are from an electrode the
weaker that actual Spike waveform will

15658
05:25:38,910 --> 05:25:38,920
weaker that actual Spike waveform will
 

15659
05:25:38,920 --> 05:25:41,948
weaker that actual Spike waveform will
look like on that electrode so uh you

15660
05:25:41,948 --> 05:25:41,958
look like on that electrode so uh you
 

15661
05:25:41,958 --> 05:25:43,350
look like on that electrode so uh you
might be able to pick up you know

15662
05:25:43,350 --> 05:25:43,360
might be able to pick up you know
 

15663
05:25:43,360 --> 05:25:44,948
might be able to pick up you know
population level activity of things that

15664
05:25:44,948 --> 05:25:44,958
population level activity of things that
 

15665
05:25:44,958 --> 05:25:46,390
population level activity of things that
are you know maybe slightly outside the

15666
05:25:46,390 --> 05:25:46,400
are you know maybe slightly outside the
 

15667
05:25:46,400 --> 05:25:47,948
are you know maybe slightly outside the
normal recording radius what what

15668
05:25:47,948 --> 05:25:47,958
normal recording radius what what
 

15669
05:25:47,958 --> 05:25:49,350
normal recording radius what what
neuroscientist sometimes refer to as the

15670
05:25:49,350 --> 05:25:49,360
neuroscientist sometimes refer to as the
 

15671
05:25:49,360 --> 05:25:51,750
neuroscientist sometimes refer to as the
hash of activity the other stuff that's

15672
05:25:51,750 --> 05:25:51,760
hash of activity the other stuff that's
 

15673
05:25:51,760 --> 05:25:53,670
hash of activity the other stuff that's
going on yeah uh and you can look at

15674
05:25:53,670 --> 05:25:53,680
going on yeah uh and you can look at
 

15675
05:25:53,680 --> 05:25:55,990
going on yeah uh and you can look at
sort of across many channels how that uh

15676
05:25:55,990 --> 05:25:56,000
sort of across many channels how that uh
 

15677
05:25:56,000 --> 05:25:57,310
sort of across many channels how that uh
sort of background noise is behaving you

15678
05:25:57,310 --> 05:25:57,320
sort of background noise is behaving you
 

15679
05:25:57,320 --> 05:25:58,390
sort of background noise is behaving you
might be able to get more juice out of

15680
05:25:58,390 --> 05:25:58,400
might be able to get more juice out of
 

15681
05:25:58,400 --> 05:26:00,070
might be able to get more juice out of
the signal that way but it comes at a

15682
05:26:00,070 --> 05:26:00,080
the signal that way but it comes at a
 

15683
05:26:00,080 --> 05:26:01,788
the signal that way but it comes at a
cost that signal is now a floating Point

15684
05:26:01,788 --> 05:26:01,798
cost that signal is now a floating Point
 

15685
05:26:01,798 --> 05:26:02,830
cost that signal is now a floating Point
representation which means it's more

15686
05:26:02,830 --> 05:26:02,840
representation which means it's more
 

15687
05:26:02,840 --> 05:26:04,670
representation which means it's more
expensive to send out over a power it

15688
05:26:04,670 --> 05:26:04,680
expensive to send out over a power it
 

15689
05:26:04,680 --> 05:26:06,910
expensive to send out over a power it
means you have to find different ways to

15690
05:26:06,910 --> 05:26:06,920
means you have to find different ways to
 

15691
05:26:06,920 --> 05:26:08,430
means you have to find different ways to
compress it that are different than you

15692
05:26:08,430 --> 05:26:08,440
compress it that are different than you
 

15693
05:26:08,440 --> 05:26:09,990
compress it that are different than you
can apply to Binary signals so there's a

15694
05:26:09,990 --> 05:26:10,000
can apply to Binary signals so there's a
 

15695
05:26:10,000 --> 05:26:11,070
can apply to Binary signals so there's a
lot of different challenges associated

15696
05:26:11,070 --> 05:26:11,080
lot of different challenges associated
 

15697
05:26:11,080 --> 05:26:12,708
lot of different challenges associated
with these different modalities so also

15698
05:26:12,708 --> 05:26:12,718
with these different modalities so also
 

15699
05:26:12,718 --> 05:26:15,150
with these different modalities so also
in terms of communication you're limited

15700
05:26:15,150 --> 05:26:15,160
in terms of communication you're limited
 

15701
05:26:15,160 --> 05:26:18,430
in terms of communication you're limited
by the amount of data you can send yeah

15702
05:26:18,430 --> 05:26:18,440
by the amount of data you can send yeah
 

15703
05:26:18,440 --> 05:26:20,470
by the amount of data you can send yeah
so and also because you're currently

15704
05:26:20,470 --> 05:26:20,480
so and also because you're currently
 

15705
05:26:20,480 --> 05:26:22,470
so and also because you're currently
using the Bluetooth protocol you have to

15706
05:26:22,470 --> 05:26:22,480
using the Bluetooth protocol you have to
 

15707
05:26:22,480 --> 05:26:24,030
using the Bluetooth protocol you have to
batch stuff

15708
05:26:24,030 --> 05:26:24,040
batch stuff
 

15709
05:26:24,040 --> 05:26:26,948
batch stuff
together but you have to also do this

15710
05:26:26,948 --> 05:26:26,958
together but you have to also do this
 

15711
05:26:26,958 --> 05:26:30,190
together but you have to also do this
keeping the latency crazy low like crazy

15712
05:26:30,190 --> 05:26:30,200
keeping the latency crazy low like crazy
 

15713
05:26:30,200 --> 05:26:33,030
keeping the latency crazy low like crazy
low anything to say about the latency

15714
05:26:33,030 --> 05:26:33,040
low anything to say about the latency
 

15715
05:26:33,040 --> 05:26:34,990
low anything to say about the latency
yeah this is a passion project of mine

15716
05:26:34,990 --> 05:26:35,000
yeah this is a passion project of mine
 

15717
05:26:35,000 --> 05:26:37,310
yeah this is a passion project of mine
so uh I want to build the best mouse in

15718
05:26:37,310 --> 05:26:37,320
so uh I want to build the best mouse in
 

15719
05:26:37,320 --> 05:26:39,030
so uh I want to build the best mouse in
the world yeah I don't want to build

15720
05:26:39,030 --> 05:26:39,040
the world yeah I don't want to build
 

15721
05:26:39,040 --> 05:26:42,190
the world yeah I don't want to build
like the you know the Chevrolet Spark or

15722
05:26:42,190 --> 05:26:42,200
like the you know the Chevrolet Spark or
 

15723
05:26:42,200 --> 05:26:43,310
like the you know the Chevrolet Spark or
whatever of electric cars I want to

15724
05:26:43,310 --> 05:26:43,320
whatever of electric cars I want to
 

15725
05:26:43,320 --> 05:26:45,470
whatever of electric cars I want to
build like the Tesla Roadster version of

15726
05:26:45,470 --> 05:26:45,480
build like the Tesla Roadster version of
 

15727
05:26:45,480 --> 05:26:48,708
build like the Tesla Roadster version of
of a mouse and I really do think it's

15728
05:26:48,708 --> 05:26:48,718
of a mouse and I really do think it's
 

15729
05:26:48,718 --> 05:26:50,510
of a mouse and I really do think it's
quite possible that within you know 5 to

15730
05:26:50,510 --> 05:26:50,520
quite possible that within you know 5 to
 

15731
05:26:50,520 --> 05:26:52,190
quite possible that within you know 5 to
10 years that most Esports competitions

15732
05:26:52,190 --> 05:26:52,200
10 years that most Esports competitions
 

15733
05:26:52,200 --> 05:26:54,510
10 years that most Esports competitions
are dominated by people with paralysis

15734
05:26:54,510 --> 05:26:54,520
are dominated by people with paralysis
 

15735
05:26:54,520 --> 05:26:56,110
are dominated by people with paralysis
this is like a very real possibility for

15736
05:26:56,110 --> 05:26:56,120
this is like a very real possibility for
 

15737
05:26:56,120 --> 05:26:57,310
this is like a very real possibility for
number of reasons one is that they'll

15738
05:26:57,310 --> 05:26:57,320
number of reasons one is that they'll
 

15739
05:26:57,320 --> 05:26:59,590
number of reasons one is that they'll
have access to the the best technology

15740
05:26:59,590 --> 05:26:59,600
have access to the the best technology
 

15741
05:26:59,600 --> 05:27:01,390
have access to the the best technology
to play video games effectively the

15742
05:27:01,390 --> 05:27:01,400
to play video games effectively the
 

15743
05:27:01,400 --> 05:27:03,390
to play video games effectively the
second is they have the time to do so so

15744
05:27:03,390 --> 05:27:03,400
second is they have the time to do so so
 

15745
05:27:03,400 --> 05:27:04,590
second is they have the time to do so so
those two factors together are

15746
05:27:04,590 --> 05:27:04,600
those two factors together are
 

15747
05:27:04,600 --> 05:27:06,750
those two factors together are
particularly potent for uh esport

15748
05:27:06,750 --> 05:27:06,760
particularly potent for uh esport
 

15749
05:27:06,760 --> 05:27:09,030
particularly potent for uh esport
competitors unless

15750
05:27:09,030 --> 05:27:09,040
competitors unless
 

15751
05:27:09,040 --> 05:27:11,350
competitors unless
uh people without paralysis are also

15752
05:27:11,350 --> 05:27:11,360
uh people without paralysis are also
 

15753
05:27:11,360 --> 05:27:14,868
uh people without paralysis are also
allowed to implant NE right which is it

15754
05:27:14,868 --> 05:27:14,878
allowed to implant NE right which is it
 

15755
05:27:14,878 --> 05:27:17,430
allowed to implant NE right which is it
is another way to interact with a

15756
05:27:17,430 --> 05:27:17,440
is another way to interact with a
 

15757
05:27:17,440 --> 05:27:20,948
is another way to interact with a
digital uh device and there's some

15758
05:27:20,948 --> 05:27:20,958
digital uh device and there's some
 

15759
05:27:20,958 --> 05:27:23,310
digital uh device and there's some
there's something to that if if it's a

15760
05:27:23,310 --> 05:27:23,320
there's something to that if if it's a
 

15761
05:27:23,320 --> 05:27:24,948
there's something to that if if it's a
fundamentally different experience more

15762
05:27:24,948 --> 05:27:24,958
fundamentally different experience more
 

15763
05:27:24,958 --> 05:27:26,948
fundamentally different experience more
efficient experience even if it's not

15764
05:27:26,948 --> 05:27:26,958
efficient experience even if it's not
 

15765
05:27:26,958 --> 05:27:29,708
efficient experience even if it's not
like some kind of full-on high bandwidth

15766
05:27:29,708 --> 05:27:29,718
like some kind of full-on high bandwidth
 

15767
05:27:29,718 --> 05:27:31,708
like some kind of full-on high bandwidth
communication if it's just ability to

15768
05:27:31,708 --> 05:27:31,718
communication if it's just ability to
 

15769
05:27:31,718 --> 05:27:32,830
communication if it's just ability to
move the

15770
05:27:32,830 --> 05:27:32,840
move the
 

15771
05:27:32,840 --> 05:27:37,070
move the
mouse uh 10x faster like the bits per

15772
05:27:37,070 --> 05:27:37,080
mouse uh 10x faster like the bits per
 

15773
05:27:37,080 --> 05:27:39,230
mouse uh 10x faster like the bits per
second if I can achieve a bis per second

15774
05:27:39,230 --> 05:27:39,240
second if I can achieve a bis per second
 

15775
05:27:39,240 --> 05:27:41,230
second if I can achieve a bis per second
at 10x what I can do with the mouse

15776
05:27:41,230 --> 05:27:41,240
at 10x what I can do with the mouse
 

15777
05:27:41,240 --> 05:27:42,788
at 10x what I can do with the mouse
that's a really interesting possibility

15778
05:27:42,788 --> 05:27:42,798
that's a really interesting possibility
 

15779
05:27:42,798 --> 05:27:45,110
that's a really interesting possibility
what they can do especially as you get

15780
05:27:45,110 --> 05:27:45,120
what they can do especially as you get
 

15781
05:27:45,120 --> 05:27:47,910
what they can do especially as you get
really good at it uh with training it's

15782
05:27:47,910 --> 05:27:47,920
really good at it uh with training it's
 

15783
05:27:47,920 --> 05:27:48,910
really good at it uh with training it's
definitely the case that you have a

15784
05:27:48,910 --> 05:27:48,920
definitely the case that you have a
 

15785
05:27:48,920 --> 05:27:50,948
definitely the case that you have a
higher ceiling of performance like you

15786
05:27:50,948 --> 05:27:50,958
higher ceiling of performance like you
 

15787
05:27:50,958 --> 05:27:52,150
higher ceiling of performance like you
because you don't have to buffer your

15788
05:27:52,150 --> 05:27:52,160
because you don't have to buffer your
 

15789
05:27:52,160 --> 05:27:53,708
because you don't have to buffer your
intention through your arm through your

15790
05:27:53,708 --> 05:27:53,718
intention through your arm through your
 

15791
05:27:53,718 --> 05:27:56,190
intention through your arm through your
muscle you get just by nature of having

15792
05:27:56,190 --> 05:27:56,200
muscle you get just by nature of having
 

15793
05:27:56,200 --> 05:27:57,750
muscle you get just by nature of having
a brain implant at all like 75

15794
05:27:57,750 --> 05:27:57,760
a brain implant at all like 75
 

15795
05:27:57,760 --> 05:28:00,030
a brain implant at all like 75
millisecond lead time on any action that

15796
05:28:00,030 --> 05:28:00,040
millisecond lead time on any action that
 

15797
05:28:00,040 --> 05:28:01,510
millisecond lead time on any action that
you're actually trying to take and

15798
05:28:01,510 --> 05:28:01,520
you're actually trying to take and
 

15799
05:28:01,520 --> 05:28:02,788
you're actually trying to take and
there's some Nuance of this like there

15800
05:28:02,788 --> 05:28:02,798
there's some Nuance of this like there
 

15801
05:28:02,798 --> 05:28:04,110
there's some Nuance of this like there
there's evidence that the motor cortex

15802
05:28:04,110 --> 05:28:04,120
there's evidence that the motor cortex
 

15803
05:28:04,120 --> 05:28:05,750
there's evidence that the motor cortex
you can sort of plan out sequences of

15804
05:28:05,750 --> 05:28:05,760
you can sort of plan out sequences of
 

15805
05:28:05,760 --> 05:28:06,910
you can sort of plan out sequences of
actions so you may not get that whole

15806
05:28:06,910 --> 05:28:06,920
actions so you may not get that whole
 

15807
05:28:06,920 --> 05:28:08,868
actions so you may not get that whole
benefit all the time but for sort of

15808
05:28:08,868 --> 05:28:08,878
benefit all the time but for sort of
 

15809
05:28:08,878 --> 05:28:11,190
benefit all the time but for sort of
like Reaction Time style uh games where

15810
05:28:11,190 --> 05:28:11,200
like Reaction Time style uh games where
 

15811
05:28:11,200 --> 05:28:12,910
like Reaction Time style uh games where
you just want to somebody's over here

15812
05:28:12,910 --> 05:28:12,920
you just want to somebody's over here
 

15813
05:28:12,920 --> 05:28:15,070
you just want to somebody's over here
snipe them you know that kind of thing

15814
05:28:15,070 --> 05:28:15,080
snipe them you know that kind of thing
 

15815
05:28:15,080 --> 05:28:16,868
snipe them you know that kind of thing
uh you actually do have just an inherent

15816
05:28:16,868 --> 05:28:16,878
uh you actually do have just an inherent
 

15817
05:28:16,878 --> 05:28:17,990
uh you actually do have just an inherent
Advantage because you don't need to go

15818
05:28:17,990 --> 05:28:18,000
Advantage because you don't need to go
 

15819
05:28:18,000 --> 05:28:19,548
Advantage because you don't need to go
through muscle so the question is just

15820
05:28:19,548 --> 05:28:19,558
through muscle so the question is just
 

15821
05:28:19,558 --> 05:28:21,110
through muscle so the question is just
how much faster can you make it and

15822
05:28:21,110 --> 05:28:21,120
how much faster can you make it and
 

15823
05:28:21,120 --> 05:28:23,510
how much faster can you make it and
we're already you know faster than uh

15824
05:28:23,510 --> 05:28:23,520
we're already you know faster than uh
 

15825
05:28:23,520 --> 05:28:24,510
we're already you know faster than uh
you know what you would do if you're

15826
05:28:24,510 --> 05:28:24,520
you know what you would do if you're
 

15827
05:28:24,520 --> 05:28:25,548
you know what you would do if you're
going through muscle from a latency

15828
05:28:25,548 --> 05:28:25,558
going through muscle from a latency
 

15829
05:28:25,558 --> 05:28:26,628
going through muscle from a latency
point of view and we're in the early

15830
05:28:26,628 --> 05:28:26,638
point of view and we're in the early
 

15831
05:28:26,638 --> 05:28:28,310
point of view and we're in the early
stage of that I think we can push it

15832
05:28:28,310 --> 05:28:28,320
stage of that I think we can push it
 

15833
05:28:28,320 --> 05:28:29,628
stage of that I think we can push it
sort of our end to end latency right now

15834
05:28:29,628 --> 05:28:29,638
sort of our end to end latency right now
 

15835
05:28:29,638 --> 05:28:31,788
sort of our end to end latency right now
from brain Spike to cursor movement is

15836
05:28:31,788 --> 05:28:31,798
from brain Spike to cursor movement is
 

15837
05:28:31,798 --> 05:28:34,350
from brain Spike to cursor movement is
about 22 milliseconds if you think about

15838
05:28:34,350 --> 05:28:34,360
about 22 milliseconds if you think about
 

15839
05:28:34,360 --> 05:28:35,868
about 22 milliseconds if you think about
uh the best mice in the world the best

15840
05:28:35,868 --> 05:28:35,878
uh the best mice in the world the best
 

15841
05:28:35,878 --> 05:28:38,230
uh the best mice in the world the best
gaming mice that's about 5 milliseconds

15842
05:28:38,230 --> 05:28:38,240
gaming mice that's about 5 milliseconds
 

15843
05:28:38,240 --> 05:28:39,750
gaming mice that's about 5 milliseconds
is of latency depending on how you

15844
05:28:39,750 --> 05:28:39,760
is of latency depending on how you
 

15845
05:28:39,760 --> 05:28:40,868
is of latency depending on how you
measure depending how fast your screen

15846
05:28:40,868 --> 05:28:40,878
measure depending how fast your screen
 

15847
05:28:40,878 --> 05:28:41,628
measure depending how fast your screen
refreshes there's a lot of

15848
05:28:41,628 --> 05:28:41,638
refreshes there's a lot of
 

15849
05:28:41,638 --> 05:28:43,510
refreshes there's a lot of
characteristics that matter there but

15850
05:28:43,510 --> 05:28:43,520
characteristics that matter there but
 

15851
05:28:43,520 --> 05:28:45,190
characteristics that matter there but
yeah and the rough time for like a

15852
05:28:45,190 --> 05:28:45,200
yeah and the rough time for like a
 

15853
05:28:45,200 --> 05:28:47,230
yeah and the rough time for like a
neuron in the brain to actually impact

15854
05:28:47,230 --> 05:28:47,240
neuron in the brain to actually impact
 

15855
05:28:47,240 --> 05:28:49,670
neuron in the brain to actually impact
your uh command of your hand is about 75

15856
05:28:49,670 --> 05:28:49,680
your uh command of your hand is about 75
 

15857
05:28:49,680 --> 05:28:51,110
your uh command of your hand is about 75
millisecond so if you look at those

15858
05:28:51,110 --> 05:28:51,120
millisecond so if you look at those
 

15859
05:28:51,120 --> 05:28:53,390
millisecond so if you look at those
numbers you can see that we're already

15860
05:28:53,390 --> 05:28:53,400
numbers you can see that we're already
 

15861
05:28:53,400 --> 05:28:55,110
numbers you can see that we're already
like you know competitive and slightly

15862
05:28:55,110 --> 05:28:55,120
like you know competitive and slightly
 

15863
05:28:55,120 --> 05:28:56,470
like you know competitive and slightly
faster than what you'd get by actually

15864
05:28:56,470 --> 05:28:56,480
faster than what you'd get by actually
 

15865
05:28:56,480 --> 05:28:58,868
faster than what you'd get by actually
moving your moving your hand and this is

15866
05:28:58,868 --> 05:28:58,878
moving your moving your hand and this is
 

15867
05:28:58,878 --> 05:29:00,390
moving your moving your hand and this is
something that you know if you ask Nolan

15868
05:29:00,390 --> 05:29:00,400
something that you know if you ask Nolan
 

15869
05:29:00,400 --> 05:29:01,948
something that you know if you ask Nolan
about it when he moved the cursor for

15870
05:29:01,948 --> 05:29:01,958
about it when he moved the cursor for
 

15871
05:29:01,958 --> 05:29:03,270
about it when he moved the cursor for
the first time we asked him about this

15872
05:29:03,270 --> 05:29:03,280
the first time we asked him about this
 

15873
05:29:03,280 --> 05:29:04,548
the first time we asked him about this
this something I was super curious about

15874
05:29:04,548 --> 05:29:04,558
this something I was super curious about
 

15875
05:29:04,558 --> 05:29:06,190
this something I was super curious about
like what does it feel like when you're

15876
05:29:06,190 --> 05:29:06,200
like what does it feel like when you're
 

15877
05:29:06,200 --> 05:29:08,110
like what does it feel like when you're
modulating you know a click intention or

15878
05:29:08,110 --> 05:29:08,120
modulating you know a click intention or
 

15879
05:29:08,120 --> 05:29:08,868
modulating you know a click intention or
when you're trying to just move the

15880
05:29:08,868 --> 05:29:08,878
when you're trying to just move the
 

15881
05:29:08,878 --> 05:29:10,910
when you're trying to just move the
cursor to the right he said it moves

15882
05:29:10,910 --> 05:29:10,920
cursor to the right he said it moves
 

15883
05:29:10,920 --> 05:29:13,150
cursor to the right he said it moves
before he is like actually intending it

15884
05:29:13,150 --> 05:29:13,160
before he is like actually intending it
 

15885
05:29:13,160 --> 05:29:15,150
before he is like actually intending it
to which is kind of a surreal thing it's

15886
05:29:15,150 --> 05:29:15,160
to which is kind of a surreal thing it's
 

15887
05:29:15,160 --> 05:29:17,310
to which is kind of a surreal thing it's
something that uh you know I would love

15888
05:29:17,310 --> 05:29:17,320
something that uh you know I would love
 

15889
05:29:17,320 --> 05:29:18,670
something that uh you know I would love
to experience myself one day what is

15890
05:29:18,670 --> 05:29:18,680
to experience myself one day what is
 

15891
05:29:18,680 --> 05:29:20,190
to experience myself one day what is
that like to have the thing just be so

15892
05:29:20,190 --> 05:29:20,200
that like to have the thing just be so
 

15893
05:29:20,200 --> 05:29:22,030
that like to have the thing just be so
immediate so fluid that it feels like

15894
05:29:22,030 --> 05:29:22,040
immediate so fluid that it feels like
 

15895
05:29:22,040 --> 05:29:24,470
immediate so fluid that it feels like
it's happening before you're uh actually

15896
05:29:24,470 --> 05:29:24,480
it's happening before you're uh actually
 

15897
05:29:24,480 --> 05:29:25,788
it's happening before you're uh actually
intending it to move yeah I suppose

15898
05:29:25,788 --> 05:29:25,798
intending it to move yeah I suppose
 

15899
05:29:25,798 --> 05:29:27,548
intending it to move yeah I suppose
we've gotten used to that latency that

15900
05:29:27,548 --> 05:29:27,558
we've gotten used to that latency that
 

15901
05:29:27,558 --> 05:29:30,990
we've gotten used to that latency that
natural latency that happens uh so is

15902
05:29:30,990 --> 05:29:31,000
natural latency that happens uh so is
 

15903
05:29:31,000 --> 05:29:32,270
natural latency that happens uh so is
the currently the bottom like the

15904
05:29:32,270 --> 05:29:32,280
the currently the bottom like the
 

15905
05:29:32,280 --> 05:29:33,670
the currently the bottom like the
communication so like the Bluetooth

15906
05:29:33,670 --> 05:29:33,680
communication so like the Bluetooth
 

15907
05:29:33,680 --> 05:29:35,190
communication so like the Bluetooth
communication is that what's the actual

15908
05:29:35,190 --> 05:29:35,200
communication is that what's the actual
 

15909
05:29:35,200 --> 05:29:36,670
communication is that what's the actual
bottle like I mean there's always going

15910
05:29:36,670 --> 05:29:36,680
bottle like I mean there's always going
 

15911
05:29:36,680 --> 05:29:37,830
bottle like I mean there's always going
to be a bottle neck what's the current

15912
05:29:37,830 --> 05:29:37,840
to be a bottle neck what's the current
 

15913
05:29:37,840 --> 05:29:40,310
to be a bottle neck what's the current
Bott on like yeah a couple things so

15914
05:29:40,310 --> 05:29:40,320
Bott on like yeah a couple things so
 

15915
05:29:40,320 --> 05:29:43,310
Bott on like yeah a couple things so
kind of hilariously Bluetooth uh low

15919
05:29:45,878 --> 05:29:48,030

05:29:48,030 --> 05:29:48,040
on how fast you can communicate so the
 

15921
05:29:48,040 --> 05:29:49,708

7.5 milliseconds and uh as we push
 

15929
05:29:56,440 --> 05:29:58,150

important Nuance to this is that it's
 

15941
05:30:09,718 --> 05:30:11,948
important Nuance to this is that it's
not just the uh neur link itself that's

of how fast screens refresh then you
 

15949
05:30:17,600 --> 05:30:19,150

have another problem like you need your
 

15951
05:30:19,160 --> 05:30:21,670
have another problem like you need your

05:30:23,830 --> 05:30:23,840
reactive as the sort of limits of what
 

15955
05:30:23,840 --> 05:30:25,430
reactive as the sort of limits of what
the technology can offer like you need

15956
05:30:25,430 --> 05:30:25,440
the technology can offer like you need
 

15957
05:30:25,440 --> 05:30:27,270
the technology can offer like you need
the screen like 120 HZ just doesn't you

15958
05:30:27,270 --> 05:30:27,280
the screen like 120 HZ just doesn't you
 

15959
05:30:27,280 --> 05:30:28,990
the screen like 120 HZ just doesn't you
know work anymore if you're trying to

15960
05:30:28,990 --> 05:30:29,000
know work anymore if you're trying to
 

15961
05:30:29,000 --> 05:30:30,190
know work anymore if you're trying to
have something respond at something

15962
05:30:30,190 --> 05:30:30,200
have something respond at something
 

15963
05:30:30,200 --> 05:30:31,230
have something respond at something
that's you know at the level of 1

15964
05:30:31,230 --> 05:30:31,240
that's you know at the level of 1
 

15965
05:30:31,240 --> 05:30:32,670
that's you know at the level of 1
millisecond that's a really cool

15966
05:30:32,670 --> 05:30:32,680
millisecond that's a really cool
 

15967
05:30:32,680 --> 05:30:35,230
millisecond that's a really cool
challenge I also like that for a t-shirt

15968
05:30:35,230 --> 05:30:35,240
challenge I also like that for a t-shirt
 

15969
05:30:35,240 --> 05:30:37,628
challenge I also like that for a t-shirt
the uh the best mouse in the world tell

15970
05:30:37,628 --> 05:30:37,638
the uh the best mouse in the world tell
 

15971
05:30:37,638 --> 05:30:39,910
the uh the best mouse in the world tell
me on the receiving end so the decoding

15972
05:30:39,910 --> 05:30:39,920
me on the receiving end so the decoding
 

15973
05:30:39,920 --> 05:30:41,628
me on the receiving end so the decoding
step now we we figured out what the

15974
05:30:41,628 --> 05:30:41,638
step now we we figured out what the
 

15975
05:30:41,638 --> 05:30:43,708
step now we we figured out what the
spikes are got them all together now

15976
05:30:43,708 --> 05:30:43,718
spikes are got them all together now
 

15977
05:30:43,718 --> 05:30:46,868
spikes are got them all together now
we're sending that over uh to the

15978
05:30:46,868 --> 05:30:46,878
we're sending that over uh to the
 

15979
05:30:46,878 --> 05:30:49,868
we're sending that over uh to the
app what's the decoding step look like

15980
05:30:49,868 --> 05:30:49,878
app what's the decoding step look like
 

15981
05:30:49,878 --> 05:30:52,150
app what's the decoding step look like
yeah so maybe first what is decoding I

15982
05:30:52,150 --> 05:30:52,160
yeah so maybe first what is decoding I
 

15983
05:30:52,160 --> 05:30:53,110
yeah so maybe first what is decoding I
think there's probably a lot of folks

15984
05:30:53,110 --> 05:30:53,120
think there's probably a lot of folks
 

15985
05:30:53,120 --> 05:30:54,510
think there's probably a lot of folks
listening that just have no clue what

15986
05:30:54,510 --> 05:30:54,520
listening that just have no clue what
 

15987
05:30:54,520 --> 05:30:56,230
listening that just have no clue what
what it means to decode brain activity

15988
05:30:56,230 --> 05:30:56,240
what it means to decode brain activity
 

15989
05:30:56,240 --> 05:30:58,470
what it means to decode brain activity
actually even if we zoom out beyond that

15990
05:30:58,470 --> 05:30:58,480
actually even if we zoom out beyond that
 

15991
05:30:58,480 --> 05:31:01,470
actually even if we zoom out beyond that
what is the app so there's a there's an

15992
05:31:01,470 --> 05:31:01,480
what is the app so there's a there's an
 

15993
05:31:01,480 --> 05:31:04,830
what is the app so there's a there's an
implant that's wirelessly communicating

15994
05:31:04,830 --> 05:31:04,840
implant that's wirelessly communicating
 

15995
05:31:04,840 --> 05:31:07,350
implant that's wirelessly communicating
with any digital device that has an app

15996
05:31:07,350 --> 05:31:07,360
with any digital device that has an app
 

15997
05:31:07,360 --> 05:31:09,548
with any digital device that has an app
installed yep so maybe can you tell me

15998
05:31:09,548 --> 05:31:09,558
installed yep so maybe can you tell me
 

15999
05:31:09,558 --> 05:31:11,590
installed yep so maybe can you tell me
at high level what the app is what the

16000
05:31:11,590 --> 05:31:11,600
at high level what the app is what the
 

16001
05:31:11,600 --> 05:31:14,708
at high level what the app is what the
software is outside of the uh the brain

16002
05:31:14,708 --> 05:31:14,718
software is outside of the uh the brain
 

16003
05:31:14,718 --> 05:31:16,910
software is outside of the uh the brain
yeah so maybe working backwards from the

16004
05:31:16,910 --> 05:31:16,920
yeah so maybe working backwards from the
 

16005
05:31:16,920 --> 05:31:19,070
yeah so maybe working backwards from the
goal the goal is to help someone with

16006
05:31:19,070 --> 05:31:19,080
goal the goal is to help someone with
 

16007
05:31:19,080 --> 05:31:21,350
goal the goal is to help someone with
paralysis in this case Noland be able to

16008
05:31:21,350 --> 05:31:21,360
paralysis in this case Noland be able to
 

16009
05:31:21,360 --> 05:31:23,910
paralysis in this case Noland be able to
navigate his computer independently and

16010
05:31:23,910 --> 05:31:23,920
navigate his computer independently and
 

16011
05:31:23,920 --> 05:31:25,470
navigate his computer independently and
we think the best way to do that is to

16012
05:31:25,470 --> 05:31:25,480
we think the best way to do that is to
 

16013
05:31:25,480 --> 05:31:27,510
we think the best way to do that is to
offer them the same tools that we have

16014
05:31:27,510 --> 05:31:27,520
offer them the same tools that we have
 

16015
05:31:27,520 --> 05:31:28,830
offer them the same tools that we have
to navigate our software because we

16016
05:31:28,830 --> 05:31:28,840
to navigate our software because we
 

16017
05:31:28,840 --> 05:31:30,070
to navigate our software because we
don't want to have to rebuild an entire

16018
05:31:30,070 --> 05:31:30,080
don't want to have to rebuild an entire
 

16019
05:31:30,080 --> 05:31:32,150
don't want to have to rebuild an entire
software ecosystem for the brain at

16020
05:31:32,150 --> 05:31:32,160
software ecosystem for the brain at
 

16021
05:31:32,160 --> 05:31:34,230
software ecosystem for the brain at
least not yet maybe someday you can

16022
05:31:34,230 --> 05:31:34,240
least not yet maybe someday you can
 

16023
05:31:34,240 --> 05:31:35,470
least not yet maybe someday you can
imagine there's uxs that are built

16024
05:31:35,470 --> 05:31:35,480
imagine there's uxs that are built
 

16025
05:31:35,480 --> 05:31:37,430
imagine there's uxs that are built
natively for BCI but in terms of what's

16026
05:31:37,430 --> 05:31:37,440
natively for BCI but in terms of what's
 

16027
05:31:37,440 --> 05:31:40,070
natively for BCI but in terms of what's
useful for people today I think we most

16028
05:31:40,070 --> 05:31:40,080
useful for people today I think we most
 

16029
05:31:40,080 --> 05:31:41,230
useful for people today I think we most
people would prefer to be able to just

16030
05:31:41,230 --> 05:31:41,240
people would prefer to be able to just
 

16031
05:31:41,240 --> 05:31:42,788
people would prefer to be able to just
control mouse and keyboard inputs to all

16032
05:31:42,788 --> 05:31:42,798
control mouse and keyboard inputs to all
 

16033
05:31:42,798 --> 05:31:44,070
control mouse and keyboard inputs to all
the applications that they want to use

16034
05:31:44,070 --> 05:31:44,080
the applications that they want to use
 

16035
05:31:44,080 --> 05:31:45,990
the applications that they want to use
for their daily jobs for communicating

16036
05:31:45,990 --> 05:31:46,000
for their daily jobs for communicating
 

16037
05:31:46,000 --> 05:31:49,030
for their daily jobs for communicating
with their friends Etc and so the job of

16038
05:31:49,030 --> 05:31:49,040
with their friends Etc and so the job of
 

16039
05:31:49,040 --> 05:31:50,788
with their friends Etc and so the job of
the application is really to translate

16040
05:31:50,788 --> 05:31:50,798
the application is really to translate
 

16041
05:31:50,798 --> 05:31:52,270
the application is really to translate
this Wireless stream of brain data

16042
05:31:52,270 --> 05:31:52,280
this Wireless stream of brain data
 

16043
05:31:52,280 --> 05:31:54,430
this Wireless stream of brain data
coming off the implant into control of

16044
05:31:54,430 --> 05:31:54,440
coming off the implant into control of
 

16045
05:31:54,440 --> 05:31:56,590
coming off the implant into control of
the computer and we do that by

16046
05:31:56,590 --> 05:31:56,600
the computer and we do that by
 

16047
05:31:56,600 --> 05:31:58,470
the computer and we do that by
essentially building a mapping from

16048
05:31:58,470 --> 05:31:58,480
essentially building a mapping from
 

16049
05:31:58,480 --> 05:32:00,628
essentially building a mapping from
brain activity to sort of the hid inputs

16050
05:32:00,628 --> 05:32:00,638
brain activity to sort of the hid inputs
 

16051
05:32:00,638 --> 05:32:03,270
brain activity to sort of the hid inputs
to the the actual Hardware so hid is

16052
05:32:03,270 --> 05:32:03,280
to the the actual Hardware so hid is
 

16053
05:32:03,280 --> 05:32:04,948
to the the actual Hardware so hid is
just the protocol for communicating like

16054
05:32:04,948 --> 05:32:04,958
just the protocol for communicating like
 

16055
05:32:04,958 --> 05:32:07,390
just the protocol for communicating like
input device events so for example move

16056
05:32:07,390 --> 05:32:07,400
input device events so for example move
 

16057
05:32:07,400 --> 05:32:10,150
input device events so for example move
Mouse to this position or press this key

16058
05:32:10,150 --> 05:32:10,160
Mouse to this position or press this key
 

16059
05:32:10,160 --> 05:32:11,788
Mouse to this position or press this key
down and so that mapping is

16060
05:32:11,788 --> 05:32:11,798
down and so that mapping is
 

16061
05:32:11,798 --> 05:32:12,868
down and so that mapping is
fundamentally what the app is

16062
05:32:12,868 --> 05:32:12,878
fundamentally what the app is
 

16063
05:32:12,878 --> 05:32:14,470
fundamentally what the app is
responsible for but there's a lot of

16064
05:32:14,470 --> 05:32:14,480
responsible for but there's a lot of
 

16065
05:32:14,480 --> 05:32:16,310
responsible for but there's a lot of
nuance of how that mapping works that we

16066
05:32:16,310 --> 05:32:16,320
nuance of how that mapping works that we
 

16067
05:32:16,320 --> 05:32:17,750
nuance of how that mapping works that we
spent a lot of time to try to get right

16068
05:32:17,750 --> 05:32:17,760
spent a lot of time to try to get right
 

16069
05:32:17,760 --> 05:32:19,150
spent a lot of time to try to get right
and we're still in the early stages of a

16070
05:32:19,150 --> 05:32:19,160
and we're still in the early stages of a
 

16071
05:32:19,160 --> 05:32:20,270
and we're still in the early stages of a
long journey to figure out how to do

16072
05:32:20,270 --> 05:32:20,280
long journey to figure out how to do
 

16073
05:32:20,280 --> 05:32:22,868
long journey to figure out how to do
that optimally uh so one part of that

16074
05:32:22,868 --> 05:32:22,878
that optimally uh so one part of that
 

16075
05:32:22,878 --> 05:32:24,590
that optimally uh so one part of that
process is decoding so decoding is this

16076
05:32:24,590 --> 05:32:24,600
process is decoding so decoding is this
 

16077
05:32:24,600 --> 05:32:26,070
process is decoding so decoding is this
process of taking the statistical

16078
05:32:26,070 --> 05:32:26,080
process of taking the statistical
 

16079
05:32:26,080 --> 05:32:27,910
process of taking the statistical
patterns of brain data that's being

16080
05:32:27,910 --> 05:32:27,920
patterns of brain data that's being
 

16081
05:32:27,920 --> 05:32:29,070
patterns of brain data that's being
channeled across this Bluetooth

16082
05:32:29,070 --> 05:32:29,080
channeled across this Bluetooth
 

16083
05:32:29,080 --> 05:32:30,868
channeled across this Bluetooth
connection to the application and

16084
05:32:30,868 --> 05:32:30,878
connection to the application and
 

16085
05:32:30,878 --> 05:32:32,510
connection to the application and
turning it into for example of mouse

16086
05:32:32,510 --> 05:32:32,520
turning it into for example of mouse
 

16087
05:32:32,520 --> 05:32:34,628
turning it into for example of mouse
movement and that decoding step you can

16088
05:32:34,628 --> 05:32:34,638
movement and that decoding step you can
 

16089
05:32:34,638 --> 05:32:35,990
movement and that decoding step you can
think of it in a couple different parts

16090
05:32:35,990 --> 05:32:36,000
think of it in a couple different parts
 

16091
05:32:36,000 --> 05:32:37,628
think of it in a couple different parts
so similar to any machine learning

16092
05:32:37,628 --> 05:32:37,638
so similar to any machine learning
 

16093
05:32:37,638 --> 05:32:38,830
so similar to any machine learning
problem there's a training step and

16094
05:32:38,830 --> 05:32:38,840
problem there's a training step and
 

16095
05:32:38,840 --> 05:32:40,628
problem there's a training step and
there's an inference step the training

16096
05:32:40,628 --> 05:32:40,638
there's an inference step the training
 

16097
05:32:40,638 --> 05:32:44,070
there's an inference step the training
step in our case is a very uh intricate

16098
05:32:44,070 --> 05:32:44,080
step in our case is a very uh intricate
 

16099
05:32:44,080 --> 05:32:46,350
step in our case is a very uh intricate
behavioral uh process where the user has

16100
05:32:46,350 --> 05:32:46,360
behavioral uh process where the user has
 

16101
05:32:46,360 --> 05:32:48,390
behavioral uh process where the user has
to imagine doing different actions so

16102
05:32:48,390 --> 05:32:48,400
to imagine doing different actions so
 

16103
05:32:48,400 --> 05:32:50,070
to imagine doing different actions so
for example they'll be presented a

16104
05:32:50,070 --> 05:32:50,080
for example they'll be presented a
 

16105
05:32:50,080 --> 05:32:51,670
for example they'll be presented a
screen with a cursor on it and they'll

16106
05:32:51,670 --> 05:32:51,680
screen with a cursor on it and they'll
 

16107
05:32:51,680 --> 05:32:53,430
screen with a cursor on it and they'll
be asked to push that cursor to the

16108
05:32:53,430 --> 05:32:53,440
be asked to push that cursor to the
 

16109
05:32:53,440 --> 05:32:55,350
be asked to push that cursor to the
right then imagine pushing that cursor

16110
05:32:55,350 --> 05:32:55,360
right then imagine pushing that cursor
 

16111
05:32:55,360 --> 05:32:57,670
right then imagine pushing that cursor
to the left push it up push it down and

16112
05:32:57,670 --> 05:32:57,680
to the left push it up push it down and
 

16113
05:32:57,680 --> 05:32:59,548
to the left push it up push it down and
we can basically build up a pattern or

16114
05:32:59,548 --> 05:32:59,558
we can basically build up a pattern or
 

16115
05:32:59,558 --> 05:33:02,510
we can basically build up a pattern or
using any sort of modern ml method uh a

16116
05:33:02,510 --> 05:33:02,520
using any sort of modern ml method uh a
 

16117
05:33:02,520 --> 05:33:05,030
using any sort of modern ml method uh a
mapping of given this brain data and

16118
05:33:05,030 --> 05:33:05,040
mapping of given this brain data and
 

16119
05:33:05,040 --> 05:33:06,830
mapping of given this brain data and
that imagin behavior map one to the

16120
05:33:06,830 --> 05:33:06,840
that imagin behavior map one to the
 

16121
05:33:06,840 --> 05:33:08,470
that imagin behavior map one to the
other and then test time you take that

16122
05:33:08,470 --> 05:33:08,480
other and then test time you take that
 

16123
05:33:08,480 --> 05:33:10,190
other and then test time you take that
same pattern matching system in our case

16124
05:33:10,190 --> 05:33:10,200
same pattern matching system in our case
 

16125
05:33:10,200 --> 05:33:11,868
same pattern matching system in our case
it's a deep neural network and you run

16126
05:33:11,868 --> 05:33:11,878
it's a deep neural network and you run
 

16127
05:33:11,878 --> 05:33:13,390
it's a deep neural network and you run
it and you take the live streamer brain

16128
05:33:13,390 --> 05:33:13,400
it and you take the live streamer brain
 

16129
05:33:13,400 --> 05:33:15,190
it and you take the live streamer brain
data coming off their implant you decode

16130
05:33:15,190 --> 05:33:15,200
data coming off their implant you decode
 

16131
05:33:15,200 --> 05:33:16,628
data coming off their implant you decode
it by pattern matching to what you saw

16132
05:33:16,628 --> 05:33:16,638
it by pattern matching to what you saw
 

16133
05:33:16,638 --> 05:33:18,990
it by pattern matching to what you saw
at calibration time and you use that for

16134
05:33:18,990 --> 05:33:19,000
at calibration time and you use that for
 

16135
05:33:19,000 --> 05:33:21,510
at calibration time and you use that for
a control of the computer now a couple

16136
05:33:21,510 --> 05:33:21,520
a control of the computer now a couple
 

16137
05:33:21,520 --> 05:33:22,750
a control of the computer now a couple
like sort of rabbit holes that I think

16138
05:33:22,750 --> 05:33:22,760
like sort of rabbit holes that I think
 

16139
05:33:22,760 --> 05:33:25,070
like sort of rabbit holes that I think
are quite interesting one of them has to

16140
05:33:25,070 --> 05:33:25,080
are quite interesting one of them has to
 

16141
05:33:25,080 --> 05:33:26,910
are quite interesting one of them has to
do with how you build that best template

16142
05:33:26,910 --> 05:33:26,920
do with how you build that best template
 

16143
05:33:26,920 --> 05:33:30,310
do with how you build that best template
matching system because there's uh a

16144
05:33:30,310 --> 05:33:30,320
matching system because there's uh a
 

16145
05:33:30,320 --> 05:33:32,628
matching system because there's uh a
variety of Behavioral challenges and

16146
05:33:32,628 --> 05:33:32,638
variety of Behavioral challenges and
 

16147
05:33:32,638 --> 05:33:33,788
variety of Behavioral challenges and
also debugging challenges when you're

16148
05:33:33,788 --> 05:33:33,798
also debugging challenges when you're
 

16149
05:33:33,798 --> 05:33:35,110
also debugging challenges when you're
working with someone who's paralyzed

16150
05:33:35,110 --> 05:33:35,120
working with someone who's paralyzed
 

16151
05:33:35,120 --> 05:33:36,350
working with someone who's paralyzed
because again fundamentally you don't

16152
05:33:36,350 --> 05:33:36,360
because again fundamentally you don't
 

16153
05:33:36,360 --> 05:33:37,470
because again fundamentally you don't
observe what they're trying to do you

16154
05:33:37,470 --> 05:33:37,480
observe what they're trying to do you
 

16155
05:33:37,480 --> 05:33:38,830
observe what they're trying to do you
can't see them attempt to move their

16156
05:33:38,830 --> 05:33:38,840
can't see them attempt to move their
 

16157
05:33:38,840 --> 05:33:41,110
can't see them attempt to move their
hand and so you have to figure out a way

16158
05:33:41,110 --> 05:33:41,120
hand and so you have to figure out a way
 

16159
05:33:41,120 --> 05:33:43,670
hand and so you have to figure out a way
to instruct the user to do something and

16160
05:33:43,670 --> 05:33:43,680
to instruct the user to do something and
 

16161
05:33:43,680 --> 05:33:45,830
to instruct the user to do something and
validate that they're doing it correctly

16162
05:33:45,830 --> 05:33:45,840
validate that they're doing it correctly
 

16163
05:33:45,840 --> 05:33:48,708
validate that they're doing it correctly
such that then you can Downstream build

16164
05:33:48,708 --> 05:33:48,718
such that then you can Downstream build
 

16165
05:33:48,718 --> 05:33:50,230
such that then you can Downstream build
with confidence the mapping between the

16166
05:33:50,230 --> 05:33:50,240
with confidence the mapping between the
 

16167
05:33:50,240 --> 05:33:53,070
with confidence the mapping between the
neural spikes and the intended action

16168
05:33:53,070 --> 05:33:53,080
neural spikes and the intended action
 

16169
05:33:53,080 --> 05:33:55,430
neural spikes and the intended action
and by doing the action correctly what I

16170
05:33:55,430 --> 05:33:55,440
and by doing the action correctly what I
 

16171
05:33:55,440 --> 05:33:56,990
and by doing the action correctly what I
really mean is at the level of

16172
05:33:56,990 --> 05:33:57,000
really mean is at the level of
 

16173
05:33:57,000 --> 05:34:00,070
really mean is at the level of
resolution of what neurons are doing so

16174
05:34:00,070 --> 05:34:00,080
resolution of what neurons are doing so
 

16175
05:34:00,080 --> 05:34:02,830
resolution of what neurons are doing so
if in Ideal World you could get a signal

16176
05:34:02,830 --> 05:34:02,840
if in Ideal World you could get a signal
 

16177
05:34:02,840 --> 05:34:05,190
if in Ideal World you could get a signal
of Behavioral intent that is ground

16178
05:34:05,190 --> 05:34:05,200
of Behavioral intent that is ground
 

16179
05:34:05,200 --> 05:34:06,990

millisecond resolution soltion then with

16182
05:34:09,110 --> 05:34:09,120
millisecond resolution soltion then with
 

16183
05:34:09,120 --> 05:34:10,590
millisecond resolution soltion then with
high confidence I could build a mapping

16184
05:34:10,590 --> 05:34:10,600
high confidence I could build a mapping
 

16185
05:34:10,600 --> 05:34:12,470
high confidence I could build a mapping
from my neuros spikes to that behavioral

16186
05:34:12,470 --> 05:34:12,480
from my neuros spikes to that behavioral
 

16187
05:34:12,480 --> 05:34:14,430
from my neuros spikes to that behavioral
intention but the challenge is again

16188
05:34:14,430 --> 05:34:14,440
intention but the challenge is again
 

16189
05:34:14,440 --> 05:34:15,990
intention but the challenge is again
that you don't observe what they're

16190
05:34:15,990 --> 05:34:16,000
that you don't observe what they're
 

16191
05:34:16,000 --> 05:34:17,990
that you don't observe what they're
actually doing and so there's a lot of

16192
05:34:17,990 --> 05:34:18,000
actually doing and so there's a lot of
 

16193
05:34:18,000 --> 05:34:19,628
actually doing and so there's a lot of
nuance to how you build user experiences

16194
05:34:19,628 --> 05:34:19,638
nuance to how you build user experiences
 

16195
05:34:19,638 --> 05:34:20,948
nuance to how you build user experiences
that give you more than just sort of a

05:34:20,948 --> 05:34:20,958
that give you more than just sort of a
 

16197
05:34:20,958 --> 05:34:23,190
that give you more than just sort of a

want to build the world's best Mouse you
 

16203
05:34:26,718 --> 05:34:28,910
want to build the world's best Mouse you
really want it to be as responsive as

05:34:44,708 --> 05:34:44,718
what we spend a lot of time working so
 

16223
05:34:44,718 --> 05:34:48,510
what we spend a lot of time working so
the calibration process the interface

the calibration process the interface
 

16225
05:34:48,520 --> 05:34:51,868
the calibration process the interface
has to encourage Precision meaning like

05:34:51,868 --> 05:34:51,878
has to encourage Precision meaning like
 

16227
05:34:51,878 --> 05:34:53,830
has to encourage Precision meaning like
whatever it does it should be super

human is going to likely do is exactly
 

16233
05:34:59,360 --> 05:35:01,868
human is going to likely do is exactly
that intention that you need and only

05:35:01,868 --> 05:35:01,878
that intention that you need and only
 

16235
05:35:01,878 --> 05:35:04,270
that intention that you need and only
that intention yeah and you don't have

16236
05:35:04,270 --> 05:35:04,280
that intention yeah and you don't have
 

16237
05:35:04,280 --> 05:35:07,270
that intention yeah and you don't have
any feedback except that may be speaking

16238
05:35:07,270 --> 05:35:07,280
any feedback except that may be speaking

05:35:07,280 --> 05:35:08,150
any feedback except that may be speaking
to you

16240
05:35:08,150 --> 05:35:08,160
to you
 

16241
05:35:08,160 --> 05:35:10,350
to you
afterwards what they actually did you

16242
05:35:10,350 --> 05:35:10,360
afterwards what they actually did you
 

16243
05:35:10,360 --> 05:35:13,910
afterwards what they actually did you
can't oh yeah right so that's a that's

16244
05:35:13,910 --> 05:35:13,920
can't oh yeah right so that's a that's
 

16245
05:35:13,920 --> 05:35:17,150
can't oh yeah right so that's a that's

05:35:32,990 --> 05:35:33,000
at this stage of neuralink is like
 

16259
05:35:33,000 --> 05:35:35,150
at this stage of neuralink is like
fundamental to the operation of the

fundamental to the operation of the
 

16261
05:35:35,160 --> 05:35:36,948
fundamental to the operation of the
thing and and not just calibration but

16262
05:35:36,948 --> 05:35:36,958
thing and and not just calibration but
 

16263
05:35:36,958 --> 05:35:39,350

continued Cali celebration essentially

16264
05:35:39,350 --> 05:35:39,360
continued Cali celebration essentially

yeah and maybe you said something that I

16266
05:35:41,590 --> 05:35:41,600
yeah and maybe you said something that I
 

16267
05:35:41,600 --> 05:35:42,788
yeah and maybe you said something that I
think is worth exploring there a little

16268
05:35:42,788 --> 05:35:42,798
think is worth exploring there a little
 

16269
05:35:42,798 --> 05:35:44,470
think is worth exploring there a little
bit you said it's you know primarily a

16270
05:35:44,470 --> 05:35:44,480
bit you said it's you know primarily a
 

16271
05:35:44,480 --> 05:35:45,910
bit you said it's you know primarily a
ux challenge and I think a large

16272
05:35:45,910 --> 05:35:45,920
ux challenge and I think a large
 

16273
05:35:45,920 --> 05:35:48,708
ux challenge and I think a large
component of it is but there is also a

16274
05:35:48,708 --> 05:35:48,718
component of it is but there is also a
 

16275
05:35:48,718 --> 05:35:49,830
component of it is but there is also a
very interesting machine learning

16276
05:35:49,830 --> 05:35:49,840
very interesting machine learning
 

16277
05:35:49,840 --> 05:35:52,390
very interesting machine learning

16296
05:36:11,830 --> 05:36:11,840
and if you think about it like there
 

16297
05:36:11,840 --> 05:36:13,470
and if you think about it like there
probably is because there are enough

05:36:13,470 --> 05:36:13,480
probably is because there are enough
 

16299
05:36:13,480 --> 05:36:15,270
probably is because there are enough

16303
05:36:17,000 --> 05:36:18,590
constraints on your model that there
should be a way with the right sort of

this is exactly how hard they're pushing

16310
05:36:23,750 --> 05:36:23,760
this is exactly how hard they're pushing
 

16311
05:36:23,760 --> 05:36:25,830
this is exactly how hard they're pushing
upwards and at this millisecond this is

05:36:27,400 --> 05:36:29,030
how hard they're trying to push upwards
it's really important to have very clean

16316
05:36:29,030 --> 05:36:29,040
it's really important to have very clean
 

16317
05:36:29,040 --> 05:36:31,670
it's really important to have very clean
labels yes so like the problem because

16318
05:36:31,670 --> 05:36:31,680
labels yes so like the problem because
 

16319
05:36:31,680 --> 05:36:33,070
labels yes so like the problem because
much harder from the machine learning

16320
05:36:33,070 --> 05:36:33,080
much harder from the machine learning
 

16321
05:36:33,080 --> 05:36:35,750
much harder from the machine learning
perspective the labels are noisy that's

16322
05:36:35,750 --> 05:36:35,760
perspective the labels are noisy that's
 

16323
05:36:35,760 --> 05:36:37,708
perspective the labels are noisy that's
correct and and then to get the clean

16324
05:36:37,708 --> 05:36:37,718
correct and and then to get the clean
 

16325
05:36:37,718 --> 05:36:41,030
correct and and then to get the clean
labels that's a ux challenge correct

16326
05:36:41,030 --> 05:36:41,040
labels that's a ux challenge correct
 

16327
05:36:41,040 --> 05:36:42,868
labels that's a ux challenge correct
although um clean labels I think maybe

16328
05:36:42,868 --> 05:36:42,878
although um clean labels I think maybe
 

16329
05:36:42,878 --> 05:36:44,470
although um clean labels I think maybe
it's worth exploring what that exactly

16330
05:36:44,470 --> 05:36:44,480
it's worth exploring what that exactly
 

16331
05:36:44,480 --> 05:36:46,670
it's worth exploring what that exactly
means I think any given labeling

16332
05:36:46,670 --> 05:36:46,680
means I think any given labeling
 

16333
05:36:46,680 --> 05:36:47,868
means I think any given labeling

user is trying to do and what really
 

16349
05:36:59,160 --> 05:37:00,310
user is trying to do and what really
matters is how accurate are those

matters is how accurate are those
 

16351
05:37:00,320 --> 05:37:03,190
matters is how accurate are those

task might be hey user imagine moving
this cursor a fixed offset so rather

16378
05:37:25,830 --> 05:37:25,840
this cursor a fixed offset so rather
 

16379
05:37:25,840 --> 05:37:27,628
this cursor a fixed offset so rather
than follow the cursor just try to move

16380
05:37:27,628 --> 05:37:27,638
than follow the cursor just try to move
 

16381
05:37:27,638 --> 05:37:29,670
than follow the cursor just try to move
it exactly 200 pixels to the right so

16382
05:37:29,670 --> 05:37:29,680
it exactly 200 pixels to the right so
 

16383
05:37:29,680 --> 05:37:31,670
it exactly 200 pixels to the right so
here's the cursor here's the target okay

16384
05:37:31,670 --> 05:37:31,680
here's the cursor here's the target okay
 

16385
05:37:31,680 --> 05:37:33,750
here's the cursor here's the target okay
cursor disappears tried to move that now

16386
05:37:33,750 --> 05:37:33,760
cursor disappears tried to move that now
 

16387
05:37:33,760 --> 05:37:36,110
cursor disappears tried to move that now
invisible cursor 200 pixels to the right

16388
05:37:36,110 --> 05:37:36,120
invisible cursor 200 pixels to the right
 

16389
05:37:36,120 --> 05:37:37,230
invisible cursor 200 pixels to the right
and the Assumption in that case would be

16390
05:37:37,230 --> 05:37:37,240
and the Assumption in that case would be
 

16391
05:37:37,240 --> 05:37:39,150
and the Assumption in that case would be
that the user can actually modulate

16392
05:37:39,150 --> 05:37:39,160
that the user can actually modulate
 

16393
05:37:39,160 --> 05:37:41,548
that the user can actually modulate
correctly that position offset but that

16394
05:37:41,548 --> 05:37:41,558
correctly that position offset but that
 

16395
05:37:41,558 --> 05:37:43,070
correctly that position offset but that
position offset assumption might be a

16396
05:37:43,070 --> 05:37:43,080
position offset assumption might be a
 

16397
05:37:43,080 --> 05:37:45,350
position offset assumption might be a
weaker assumption and therefore

16398
05:37:45,350 --> 05:37:45,360
weaker assumption and therefore
 

16399
05:37:45,360 --> 05:37:46,470
weaker assumption and therefore
potentially you can make it more

16400
05:37:46,470 --> 05:37:46,480
potentially you can make it more
 

16401
05:37:46,480 --> 05:37:48,030
potentially you can make it more
accurate than these heris that are

16402
05:37:48,030 --> 05:37:48,040
accurate than these heris that are
 

16403
05:37:48,040 --> 05:37:48,910
accurate than these heris that are
trying to guesstimate at each

16404
05:37:48,910 --> 05:37:48,920
trying to guesstimate at each
 

16405
05:37:48,920 --> 05:37:50,150
trying to guesstimate at each
millisecond what the user is trying to

16406
05:37:50,150 --> 05:37:50,160
millisecond what the user is trying to
 

16407
05:37:50,160 --> 05:37:52,590
millisecond what the user is trying to
do so you can imagine different tasks

16408
05:37:52,590 --> 05:37:52,600
do so you can imagine different tasks
 

16409
05:37:52,600 --> 05:37:54,150
do so you can imagine different tasks
that make different assumptions about

16410
05:37:54,150 --> 05:37:54,160
that make different assumptions about
 

16411
05:37:54,160 --> 05:37:56,030
that make different assumptions about
the the nature of the user intention and

16412
05:37:56,030 --> 05:37:56,040
the the nature of the user intention and
 

16413
05:37:56,040 --> 05:37:58,310
the the nature of the user intention and
those assumptions being correct is what

16414
05:37:58,310 --> 05:37:58,320
those assumptions being correct is what
 

16415
05:37:58,320 --> 05:38:00,150
those assumptions being correct is what
I would think of as a clean label for

16416
05:38:00,150 --> 05:38:00,160
I would think of as a clean label for
 

16417
05:38:00,160 --> 05:38:02,030
I would think of as a clean label for
that step what are we supposed to be

16418
05:38:02,030 --> 05:38:02,040
that step what are we supposed to be
 

16419
05:38:02,040 --> 05:38:04,270
that step what are we supposed to be
visualizing there's a cursor and you

16420
05:38:04,270 --> 05:38:04,280
visualizing there's a cursor and you
 

16421
05:38:04,280 --> 05:38:05,708
visualizing there's a cursor and you
want to move that cursor to the right or

16422
05:38:05,708 --> 05:38:05,718
want to move that cursor to the right or
 

16423
05:38:05,718 --> 05:38:08,070
want to move that cursor to the right or
the left up and down or maybe move them

16424
05:38:08,070 --> 05:38:08,080
the left up and down or maybe move them
 

16425
05:38:08,080 --> 05:38:09,390
the left up and down or maybe move them
by a certain

16426
05:38:09,390 --> 05:38:09,400
by a certain
 

16427
05:38:09,400 --> 05:38:11,670
by a certain
offset so that's one way is that the

16428
05:38:11,670 --> 05:38:11,680
offset so that's one way is that the
 

16429
05:38:11,680 --> 05:38:13,470
offset so that's one way is that the
best way to do calibration so for

16430
05:38:13,470 --> 05:38:13,480
best way to do calibration so for
 

16431
05:38:13,480 --> 05:38:15,948
best way to do calibration so for
example an alternative crazy way that

16432
05:38:15,948 --> 05:38:15,958
example an alternative crazy way that
 

16433
05:38:15,958 --> 05:38:17,628
example an alternative crazy way that
probably is playing a role here as a

16434
05:38:17,628 --> 05:38:17,638
probably is playing a role here as a
 

16435
05:38:17,638 --> 05:38:21,628
probably is playing a role here as a
game like web grid MH where you're just

16436
05:38:21,628 --> 05:38:21,638
game like web grid MH where you're just
 

16437
05:38:21,638 --> 05:38:24,030
game like web grid MH where you're just
getting a very large amount of data the

16438
05:38:24,030 --> 05:38:24,040
getting a very large amount of data the
 

16439
05:38:24,040 --> 05:38:26,708
getting a very large amount of data the
person playing a game where if they are

16440
05:38:26,708 --> 05:38:26,718
person playing a game where if they are
 

16441
05:38:26,718 --> 05:38:30,470
person playing a game where if they are
in the state of flow maybe you can get

16442
05:38:30,470 --> 05:38:30,480
in the state of flow maybe you can get
 

16443
05:38:30,480 --> 05:38:34,910
in the state of flow maybe you can get
clean signal as a side effect Y is that

16444
05:38:34,910 --> 05:38:34,920
clean signal as a side effect Y is that
 

16445
05:38:34,920 --> 05:38:36,948
clean signal as a side effect Y is that
or is it is that not an effective way

16446
05:38:36,948 --> 05:38:36,958
or is it is that not an effective way
 

16447
05:38:36,958 --> 05:38:38,948
or is it is that not an effective way
for initial calibration yeah great

16448
05:38:38,948 --> 05:38:38,958
for initial calibration yeah great
 

16449
05:38:38,958 --> 05:38:40,548
for initial calibration yeah great
question there's a lot to unpack there

16450
05:38:40,548 --> 05:38:40,558
question there's a lot to unpack there
 

16451
05:38:40,558 --> 05:38:43,190
question there's a lot to unpack there
so uh the first thing I would draw a

16452
05:38:43,190 --> 05:38:43,200
so uh the first thing I would draw a
 

16453
05:38:43,200 --> 05:38:44,868
so uh the first thing I would draw a
distinction between a sort of open loop

16454
05:38:44,868 --> 05:38:44,878
distinction between a sort of open loop
 

16455
05:38:44,878 --> 05:38:46,830
distinction between a sort of open loop
versus close loop so open loop what I

16456
05:38:46,830 --> 05:38:46,840
versus close loop so open loop what I
 

16457
05:38:46,840 --> 05:38:48,670
versus close loop so open loop what I
mean by that is the user is sort of

16458
05:38:48,670 --> 05:38:48,680
mean by that is the user is sort of
 

16459
05:38:48,680 --> 05:38:50,030
mean by that is the user is sort of
going from zero to one they have no

16460
05:38:50,030 --> 05:38:50,040
going from zero to one they have no
 

16461
05:38:50,040 --> 05:38:51,708
going from zero to one they have no
model at all and they're trying to get

16462
05:38:51,708 --> 05:38:51,718
model at all and they're trying to get
 

16463
05:38:51,718 --> 05:38:53,150
model at all and they're trying to get
to the place where they have some level

16464
05:38:53,150 --> 05:38:53,160
to the place where they have some level
 

16465
05:38:53,160 --> 05:38:56,468
to the place where they have some level
of control at all in that setup you

16466
05:38:56,468 --> 05:38:56,478
of control at all in that setup you
 

16467
05:38:56,478 --> 05:38:58,150
of control at all in that setup you
really need to have some task that gives

16468
05:38:58,150 --> 05:38:58,160
really need to have some task that gives
 

16469
05:38:58,160 --> 05:38:59,510
really need to have some task that gives
the user a hint of what you want them to

16470
05:38:59,510 --> 05:38:59,520
the user a hint of what you want them to
 

16471
05:38:59,520 --> 05:39:00,868
the user a hint of what you want them to
do such that you can build its mapping

16472
05:39:00,868 --> 05:39:00,878
do such that you can build its mapping
 

16473
05:39:00,878 --> 05:39:04,030
do such that you can build its mapping
again from brain data to to Output then

16474
05:39:04,030 --> 05:39:04,040
again from brain data to to Output then
 

16475
05:39:04,040 --> 05:39:05,990
again from brain data to to Output then
once they have a model you could imagine

16476
05:39:05,990 --> 05:39:06,000
once they have a model you could imagine
 

16477
05:39:06,000 --> 05:39:07,788
once they have a model you could imagine
them using that model and actually

16478
05:39:07,788 --> 05:39:07,798
them using that model and actually
 

16479
05:39:07,798 --> 05:39:09,430
them using that model and actually
adapting to it and figuring out the

16480
05:39:09,430 --> 05:39:09,440
adapting to it and figuring out the
 

16481
05:39:09,440 --> 05:39:11,070
adapting to it and figuring out the
right way to use it themsel and then

16482
05:39:11,070 --> 05:39:11,080
right way to use it themsel and then
 

16483
05:39:11,080 --> 05:39:12,788
right way to use it themsel and then
retraining on that data to give you sort

16484
05:39:12,788 --> 05:39:12,798
retraining on that data to give you sort
 

16485
05:39:12,798 --> 05:39:14,830
retraining on that data to give you sort
of a boost in performance M there's a

16486
05:39:14,830 --> 05:39:14,840
of a boost in performance M there's a
 

16487
05:39:14,840 --> 05:39:16,150
of a boost in performance M there's a
lot of challenges associated with both

16488
05:39:16,150 --> 05:39:16,160
lot of challenges associated with both
 

16489
05:39:16,160 --> 05:39:17,350
lot of challenges associated with both
of these techniques and we can sort of

16490
05:39:17,350 --> 05:39:17,360
of these techniques and we can sort of
 

16491
05:39:17,360 --> 05:39:18,548
of these techniques and we can sort of
rabbit hole into both of them if if

16492
05:39:18,548 --> 05:39:18,558
rabbit hole into both of them if if
 

16493
05:39:18,558 --> 05:39:20,590
rabbit hole into both of them if if
you're interested but the sort of

16494
05:39:20,590 --> 05:39:20,600
you're interested but the sort of
 

16495
05:39:20,600 --> 05:39:21,990
you're interested but the sort of
challenge with the open loop task is

16496
05:39:21,990 --> 05:39:22,000
challenge with the open loop task is
 

16497
05:39:22,000 --> 05:39:24,070
challenge with the open loop task is
that the user themselves doesn't get

16498
05:39:24,070 --> 05:39:24,080
that the user themselves doesn't get
 

16499
05:39:24,080 --> 05:39:25,548
that the user themselves doesn't get
propri receptive feedback about what

16500
05:39:25,548 --> 05:39:25,558
propri receptive feedback about what
 

16501
05:39:25,558 --> 05:39:27,468
propri receptive feedback about what
they're doing they don't you know

16502
05:39:27,468 --> 05:39:27,478
they're doing they don't you know
 

16503
05:39:27,478 --> 05:39:30,030
they're doing they don't you know
necessarily perceive themsel or feel you

16504
05:39:30,030 --> 05:39:30,040
necessarily perceive themsel or feel you
 

16505
05:39:30,040 --> 05:39:31,750
necessarily perceive themsel or feel you
know the mouse under their hand when

16506
05:39:31,750 --> 05:39:31,760
know the mouse under their hand when
 

16507
05:39:31,760 --> 05:39:33,070
know the mouse under their hand when
they're using an open loop or when

16508
05:39:33,070 --> 05:39:33,080
they're using an open loop or when
 

16509
05:39:33,080 --> 05:39:33,990
they're using an open loop or when
they're trying to do an open loop

16510
05:39:33,990 --> 05:39:34,000
they're trying to do an open loop
 

16511
05:39:34,000 --> 05:39:35,150
they're trying to do an open loop
calibration they're being asked to

16512
05:39:35,150 --> 05:39:35,160
calibration they're being asked to
 

16513
05:39:35,160 --> 05:39:36,708
calibration they're being asked to
perform something like imagine if you

16514
05:39:36,708 --> 05:39:36,718
perform something like imagine if you
 

16515
05:39:36,718 --> 05:39:39,350
perform something like imagine if you
sort of had your whole right arm numbed

16516
05:39:39,350 --> 05:39:39,360
sort of had your whole right arm numbed
 

16517
05:39:39,360 --> 05:39:41,150
sort of had your whole right arm numbed
and you stuck it in a box and you

16518
05:39:41,150 --> 05:39:41,160
and you stuck it in a box and you
 

16519
05:39:41,160 --> 05:39:42,390
and you stuck it in a box and you
couldn't see it so you had no visual

16520
05:39:42,390 --> 05:39:42,400
couldn't see it so you had no visual
 

16521
05:39:42,400 --> 05:39:43,628
couldn't see it so you had no visual
feedback and you had no appropri

16522
05:39:43,628 --> 05:39:43,638
feedback and you had no appropri
 

16523
05:39:43,638 --> 05:39:44,868
feedback and you had no appropri
acceptive feedback about what the

16524
05:39:44,868 --> 05:39:44,878
acceptive feedback about what the
 

16525
05:39:44,878 --> 05:39:47,110
acceptive feedback about what the
position or activity of your arm was and

16526
05:39:47,110 --> 05:39:47,120
position or activity of your arm was and
 

16527
05:39:47,120 --> 05:39:48,350
position or activity of your arm was and
now you're asked okay given this thing

16528
05:39:48,350 --> 05:39:48,360
now you're asked okay given this thing
 

16529
05:39:48,360 --> 05:39:49,750
now you're asked okay given this thing
on the screen that's moving from left to

16530
05:39:49,750 --> 05:39:49,760
on the screen that's moving from left to
 

16531
05:39:49,760 --> 05:39:52,910
on the screen that's moving from left to
right match that speed and you basically

16532
05:39:52,910 --> 05:39:52,920
right match that speed and you basically
 

16533
05:39:52,920 --> 05:39:55,670
right match that speed and you basically
can try your best to you know invoke

16534
05:39:55,670 --> 05:39:55,680
can try your best to you know invoke
 

16535
05:39:55,680 --> 05:39:57,548
can try your best to you know invoke
whatever that imagined action is in your

16536
05:39:57,548 --> 05:39:57,558
whatever that imagined action is in your
 

16537
05:39:57,558 --> 05:39:58,868
whatever that imagined action is in your
brain that's moving the cursor from left

16538
05:39:58,868 --> 05:39:58,878
brain that's moving the cursor from left
 

16539
05:39:58,878 --> 05:40:01,350
brain that's moving the cursor from left
to right but in any situation you're

16540
05:40:01,350 --> 05:40:01,360
to right but in any situation you're
 

16541
05:40:01,360 --> 05:40:02,750
to right but in any situation you're
going to be inaccurate and maybe

16542
05:40:02,750 --> 05:40:02,760
going to be inaccurate and maybe
 

16543
05:40:02,760 --> 05:40:04,948
going to be inaccurate and maybe
inconsistent in how you do that task and

16544
05:40:04,948 --> 05:40:04,958
inconsistent in how you do that task and
 

16545
05:40:04,958 --> 05:40:05,830
inconsistent in how you do that task and
so that's sort of the fundamental

16546
05:40:05,830 --> 05:40:05,840
so that's sort of the fundamental
 

16547
05:40:05,840 --> 05:40:07,670
so that's sort of the fundamental
challenge of open loop the challenge

16548
05:40:07,670 --> 05:40:07,680
challenge of open loop the challenge
 

16549
05:40:07,680 --> 05:40:10,190
challenge of open loop the challenge
with Clos Loop is that once the users

16550
05:40:10,190 --> 05:40:10,200
with Clos Loop is that once the users
 

16551
05:40:10,200 --> 05:40:11,150
with Clos Loop is that once the users
given a

16552
05:40:11,150 --> 05:40:11,160
given a
 

16553
05:40:11,160 --> 05:40:13,350
given a
model uh and they're able to start

16554
05:40:13,350 --> 05:40:13,360
model uh and they're able to start
 

16555
05:40:13,360 --> 05:40:15,628
model uh and they're able to start
moving the mouse on their own they're

16556
05:40:15,628 --> 05:40:15,638
moving the mouse on their own they're
 

16557
05:40:15,638 --> 05:40:17,390
moving the mouse on their own they're
going to very naturally adapt to that

16558
05:40:17,390 --> 05:40:17,400
going to very naturally adapt to that
 

16559
05:40:17,400 --> 05:40:20,070
going to very naturally adapt to that
model and that co-adaptation between the

16560
05:40:20,070 --> 05:40:20,080
model and that co-adaptation between the
 

16561
05:40:20,080 --> 05:40:21,628
model and that co-adaptation between the
model learning what they're doing and

16562
05:40:21,628 --> 05:40:21,638
model learning what they're doing and
 

16563
05:40:21,638 --> 05:40:23,628
model learning what they're doing and
the user learning how to use the model

16564
05:40:23,628 --> 05:40:23,638
the user learning how to use the model
 

16565
05:40:23,638 --> 05:40:25,230
the user learning how to use the model
may not find you the best sort of global

16566
05:40:25,230 --> 05:40:25,240
may not find you the best sort of global
 

16567
05:40:25,240 --> 05:40:27,150
may not find you the best sort of global
Minima it maybe that your first model

16568
05:40:27,150 --> 05:40:27,160
Minima it maybe that your first model
 

16569
05:40:27,160 --> 05:40:30,548
Minima it maybe that your first model
was noisy in some ways or um you know

16570
05:40:30,548 --> 05:40:30,558
was noisy in some ways or um you know
 

16571
05:40:30,558 --> 05:40:32,110
was noisy in some ways or um you know
maybe just had some like Quirk there's

16572
05:40:32,110 --> 05:40:32,120
maybe just had some like Quirk there's
 

16573
05:40:32,120 --> 05:40:33,390
maybe just had some like Quirk there's
some like part of the data distribution

16574
05:40:33,390 --> 05:40:33,400
some like part of the data distribution
 

16575
05:40:33,400 --> 05:40:35,430
some like part of the data distribution
it didn't cover super well and the user

16576
05:40:35,430 --> 05:40:35,440
it didn't cover super well and the user
 

16577
05:40:35,440 --> 05:40:37,468
it didn't cover super well and the user
now figures out because they're you

16578
05:40:37,468 --> 05:40:37,478
now figures out because they're you
 

16579
05:40:37,478 --> 05:40:38,750
now figures out because they're you
brilliant user like Nolan they figure

16580
05:40:38,750 --> 05:40:38,760
brilliant user like Nolan they figure
 

16581
05:40:38,760 --> 05:40:40,868
brilliant user like Nolan they figure
out the right sequence of imagin motion

16582
05:40:40,868 --> 05:40:40,878
out the right sequence of imagin motion
 

16583
05:40:40,878 --> 05:40:42,070
out the right sequence of imagin motion
motions or the right angle they have to

16584
05:40:42,070 --> 05:40:42,080
motions or the right angle they have to
 

16585
05:40:42,080 --> 05:40:43,788
motions or the right angle they have to
hold their hand at to get it to work and

16586
05:40:43,788 --> 05:40:43,798
hold their hand at to get it to work and
 

16587
05:40:43,798 --> 05:40:45,190
hold their hand at to get it to work and
they'll get it to work great but then

16588
05:40:45,190 --> 05:40:45,200
they'll get it to work great but then
 

16589
05:40:45,200 --> 05:40:46,270
they'll get it to work great but then
the next day they come back to their

16590
05:40:46,270 --> 05:40:46,280
the next day they come back to their
 

16591
05:40:46,280 --> 05:40:47,750
the next day they come back to their
device and maybe they don't remember

16592
05:40:47,750 --> 05:40:47,760
device and maybe they don't remember
 

16593
05:40:47,760 --> 05:40:48,990
device and maybe they don't remember
exactly all the tricks that they used

16594
05:40:48,990 --> 05:40:49,000
exactly all the tricks that they used
 

16595
05:40:49,000 --> 05:40:50,110
exactly all the tricks that they used
the previous day and so there's a

16596
05:40:50,110 --> 05:40:50,120
the previous day and so there's a
 

16597
05:40:50,120 --> 05:40:51,910
the previous day and so there's a
complicated sort of feedback cycle here

16598
05:40:51,910 --> 05:40:51,920
complicated sort of feedback cycle here
 

16599
05:40:51,920 --> 05:40:53,868
complicated sort of feedback cycle here
that can uh that can emerge and can make

16600
05:40:53,868 --> 05:40:53,878
that can uh that can emerge and can make
 

16601
05:40:53,878 --> 05:40:55,628
that can uh that can emerge and can make
it a very very difficult debugging

16602
05:40:55,628 --> 05:40:55,638
it a very very difficult debugging
 

16603
05:40:55,638 --> 05:40:57,548
it a very very difficult debugging

like considers maybe we should fix this

16636
05:41:29,350 --> 05:41:29,360
like considers maybe we should fix this
 

16637
05:41:29,360 --> 05:41:31,628
like considers maybe we should fix this
they just adapt and that's a really

16638
05:41:31,628 --> 05:41:31,638
they just adapt and that's a really
 

16639
05:41:31,638 --> 05:41:33,750
they just adapt and that's a really
interesting notion that we just had we

16640
05:41:33,750 --> 05:41:33,760
interesting notion that we just had we
 

16641
05:41:33,760 --> 05:41:36,110
interesting notion that we just had we
were really good at adapting but you

16642
05:41:36,110 --> 05:41:36,120
were really good at adapting but you
 

16643
05:41:36,120 --> 05:41:37,788
were really good at adapting but you
need to still

16644
05:41:37,788 --> 05:41:37,798
need to still
 

16645
05:41:37,798 --> 05:41:39,910
need to still
that might not be the optimal yeah okay

16646
05:41:39,910 --> 05:41:39,920
that might not be the optimal yeah okay
 

16647
05:41:39,920 --> 05:41:41,310
that might not be the optimal yeah okay
so how do you solve that problem do you

16648
05:41:41,310 --> 05:41:41,320
so how do you solve that problem do you
 

16649
05:41:41,320 --> 05:41:43,548
so how do you solve that problem do you
have to restart from scratch every once

16650
05:41:43,548 --> 05:41:43,558
have to restart from scratch every once
 

16651
05:41:43,558 --> 05:41:45,390
have to restart from scratch every once
in a while kind of thing yeah it's a

16652
05:41:45,390 --> 05:41:45,400
in a while kind of thing yeah it's a
 

16653
05:41:45,400 --> 05:41:47,030
in a while kind of thing yeah it's a
good question um first and foremost I

16654
05:41:47,030 --> 05:41:47,040
good question um first and foremost I
 

16655
05:41:47,040 --> 05:41:48,628
good question um first and foremost I
would say this is not a solved problem

16656
05:41:48,628 --> 05:41:48,638
would say this is not a solved problem
 

16657
05:41:48,638 --> 05:41:50,190
would say this is not a solved problem
and for anyone who's you know listening

16658
05:41:50,190 --> 05:41:50,200
and for anyone who's you know listening
 

16659
05:41:50,200 --> 05:41:52,948
and for anyone who's you know listening
in Academia who works on bcis I would

16660
05:41:52,948 --> 05:41:52,958
in Academia who works on bcis I would
 

16661
05:41:52,958 --> 05:41:54,190
in Academia who works on bcis I would
also say this is not a problem that's

16662
05:41:54,190 --> 05:41:54,200
also say this is not a problem that's
 

16663
05:41:54,200 --> 05:41:56,150
also say this is not a problem that's
solved by simply scaling Channel count

16664
05:41:56,150 --> 05:41:56,160
solved by simply scaling Channel count
 

16665
05:41:56,160 --> 05:41:57,628
solved by simply scaling Channel count
so this is you know maybe that can help

16666
05:41:57,628 --> 05:41:57,638
so this is you know maybe that can help
 

16667
05:41:57,638 --> 05:41:59,110
so this is you know maybe that can help
and you can get sort of richer covariant

16668
05:41:59,110 --> 05:41:59,120
and you can get sort of richer covariant
 

16669
05:41:59,120 --> 05:42:00,830
and you can get sort of richer covariant
structures that you can use to exploit

16670
05:42:00,830 --> 05:42:00,840
structures that you can use to exploit
 

16671
05:42:00,840 --> 05:42:01,910
structures that you can use to exploit
when trying to come up with good

16672
05:42:01,910 --> 05:42:01,920
when trying to come up with good
 

16673
05:42:01,920 --> 05:42:03,708
when trying to come up with good
labeling strategies but if you know

16674
05:42:03,708 --> 05:42:03,718
labeling strategies but if you know
 

16675
05:42:03,718 --> 05:42:04,590
labeling strategies but if you know
you're interested in problems that

16676
05:42:04,590 --> 05:42:04,600
you're interested in problems that
 

16677
05:42:04,600 --> 05:42:05,948
you're interested in problems that
aren't going to be solved inherently by

16678
05:42:05,948 --> 05:42:05,958
aren't going to be solved inherently by
 

16679
05:42:05,958 --> 05:42:08,190
aren't going to be solved inherently by
scaling Channel account this is one of M

16680
05:42:08,190 --> 05:42:08,200
scaling Channel account this is one of M
 

16681
05:42:08,200 --> 05:42:10,030
scaling Channel account this is one of M
yeah so how do you solve it it's not a

16682
05:42:10,030 --> 05:42:10,040
yeah so how do you solve it it's not a
 

16683
05:42:10,040 --> 05:42:11,150
yeah so how do you solve it it's not a
solve problem that's the first thing I

16684
05:42:11,150 --> 05:42:11,160
solve problem that's the first thing I
 

16685
05:42:11,160 --> 05:42:12,910
solve problem that's the first thing I
want to make sure it gets across the

16686
05:42:12,910 --> 05:42:12,920
want to make sure it gets across the
 

16687
05:42:12,920 --> 05:42:14,468
want to make sure it gets across the
second thing is any solution that

16688
05:42:14,468 --> 05:42:14,478
second thing is any solution that
 

16689
05:42:14,478 --> 05:42:17,390
second thing is any solution that
involves Clos Loop uh is going to become

16690
05:42:17,390 --> 05:42:17,400
involves Clos Loop uh is going to become
 

16691
05:42:17,400 --> 05:42:18,868
involves Clos Loop uh is going to become
a very difficult debugging problem and

16692
05:42:18,868 --> 05:42:18,878
a very difficult debugging problem and
 

16693
05:42:18,878 --> 05:42:21,390
a very difficult debugging problem and
one of my sort of generalistic for

16694
05:42:21,390 --> 05:42:21,400
one of my sort of generalistic for
 

16695
05:42:21,400 --> 05:42:22,788
one of my sort of generalistic for
choosing what problems to tackle is that

16696
05:42:22,788 --> 05:42:22,798
choosing what problems to tackle is that
 

16697
05:42:22,798 --> 05:42:23,708
choosing what problems to tackle is that
you want to choose the one that's going

16698
05:42:23,708 --> 05:42:23,718
you want to choose the one that's going
 

16699
05:42:23,718 --> 05:42:25,590
you want to choose the one that's going
to be the easiest to debug MH because if

16700
05:42:25,590 --> 05:42:25,600
to be the easiest to debug MH because if
 

16701
05:42:25,600 --> 05:42:28,468
to be the easiest to debug MH because if
you can do that uh even if the ceiling

16702
05:42:28,468 --> 05:42:28,478
you can do that uh even if the ceiling
 

16703
05:42:28,478 --> 05:42:30,868
you can do that uh even if the ceiling
is lower you're going to be able to move

16704
05:42:30,868 --> 05:42:30,878
is lower you're going to be able to move
 

16705
05:42:30,878 --> 05:42:32,468
is lower you're going to be able to move
faster because you have a tighter

16706
05:42:32,468 --> 05:42:32,478
faster because you have a tighter
 

16707
05:42:32,478 --> 05:42:34,350
faster because you have a tighter
iteration Loop debugging the problem and

16708
05:42:34,350 --> 05:42:34,360
iteration Loop debugging the problem and
 

16709
05:42:34,360 --> 05:42:36,430
iteration Loop debugging the problem and
in the open loop setting there's not a

16710
05:42:36,430 --> 05:42:36,440
in the open loop setting there's not a
 

16711
05:42:36,440 --> 05:42:37,948
in the open loop setting there's not a
feedback cycle debug with the user in

16712
05:42:37,948 --> 05:42:37,958
feedback cycle debug with the user in
 

16713
05:42:37,958 --> 05:42:39,628
feedback cycle debug with the user in
the loop and so there's some reason to

16714
05:42:39,628 --> 05:42:39,638
the loop and so there's some reason to
 

16715
05:42:39,638 --> 05:42:42,110
the loop and so there's some reason to

in straight line to the Target M it
 

16843
05:44:38,478 --> 05:44:40,310
in straight line to the Target M it
turns out that making those assumptions

16844
05:44:40,310 --> 05:44:40,320
turns out that making those assumptions
 

16845
05:44:40,320 --> 05:44:42,670
turns out that making those assumptions
is actually more effective in producing

05:44:49,708 --> 05:44:49,718
or whatever yeah there's a obviously a
 

16855
05:44:49,718 --> 05:44:51,030
or whatever yeah there's a obviously a
really strong correlation between the

16856
05:44:51,030 --> 05:44:51,040
really strong correlation between the
 

16857
05:44:51,040 --> 05:44:53,150
really strong correlation between the
two but the intention is a more powerful

16858
05:44:53,150 --> 05:44:53,160
two but the intention is a more powerful
 

16859
05:44:53,160 --> 05:44:56,190

05:44:56,200 --> 05:44:58,150

that's also super interesting I mean the

16862
05:44:58,150 --> 05:44:58,160
that's also super interesting I mean the
 

16863
05:44:58,160 --> 05:45:02,270
that's also super interesting I mean the

16869
05:45:06,600 --> 05:45:09,190
the digital telepathy you're acting on
the attention not the action which is

16870
05:45:09,190 --> 05:45:09,200
the attention not the action which is
 

16871
05:45:09,200 --> 05:45:11,910
the attention not the action which is
why there's an experience of like

16872
05:45:11,910 --> 05:45:11,920
why there's an experience of like
 

16873
05:45:11,920 --> 05:45:13,788
why there's an experience of like
feeling like it's happening before you

16874
05:45:13,788 --> 05:45:13,798
feeling like it's happening before you
 

16875
05:45:13,798 --> 05:45:17,070
feeling like it's happening before you
meant for it to happen that is so cool

16876
05:45:17,070 --> 05:45:17,080
meant for it to happen that is so cool
 

16877
05:45:17,080 --> 05:45:18,788
meant for it to happen that is so cool
and that is why you could achieve like

16878
05:45:18,788 --> 05:45:18,798
and that is why you could achieve like
 

16879
05:45:18,798 --> 05:45:20,468
and that is why you could achieve like
super human performance probably in

16880
05:45:20,468 --> 05:45:20,478
super human performance probably in
 

16881
05:45:20,478 --> 05:45:22,510
super human performance probably in
terms of the control of the mouse so the

16882
05:45:22,510 --> 05:45:22,520
terms of the control of the mouse so the
 

16883
05:45:22,520 --> 05:45:24,670
terms of the control of the mouse so the
for open loop just to clarify so

16884
05:45:24,670 --> 05:45:24,680
for open loop just to clarify so
 

16885
05:45:24,680 --> 05:45:27,990
for open loop just to clarify so
whenever the a person is tasked to like

16886
05:45:27,990 --> 05:45:28,000
whenever the a person is tasked to like
 

16887
05:45:28,000 --> 05:45:30,030
whenever the a person is tasked to like
move the mouse to the right you said

16888
05:45:30,030 --> 05:45:30,040
move the mouse to the right you said
 

16889
05:45:30,040 --> 05:45:31,750
move the mouse to the right you said
there's not feedback

16890
05:45:31,750 --> 05:45:31,760
there's not feedback
 

16891
05:45:31,760 --> 05:45:34,230
there's not feedback
so they don't get to get that

16892
05:45:34,230 --> 05:45:34,240
so they don't get to get that
 

16893
05:45:34,240 --> 05:45:36,628
so they don't get to get that
satisfaction of like actually getting it

16894
05:45:36,628 --> 05:45:36,638
satisfaction of like actually getting it
 

16895
05:45:36,638 --> 05:45:38,070
satisfaction of like actually getting it
to move

16896
05:45:38,070 --> 05:45:38,080
to move
 

16897
05:45:38,080 --> 05:45:39,628
to move
right so you you could imagine giving

16898
05:45:39,628 --> 05:45:39,638
right so you you could imagine giving
 

16899
05:45:39,638 --> 05:45:42,110
right so you you could imagine giving
the user feedback on the screen but uh

16900
05:45:42,110 --> 05:45:42,120
the user feedback on the screen but uh
 

16901
05:45:42,120 --> 05:45:43,310
the user feedback on the screen but uh
it's difficult because at this point you

16902
05:45:43,310 --> 05:45:43,320
it's difficult because at this point you
 

16903
05:45:43,320 --> 05:45:44,948
it's difficult because at this point you
don't know what they're attempting to do

16904
05:45:44,948 --> 05:45:44,958
don't know what they're attempting to do
 

16905
05:45:44,958 --> 05:45:46,310
don't know what they're attempting to do
so what what can you show them that

16906
05:45:46,310 --> 05:45:46,320
so what what can you show them that
 

16907
05:45:46,320 --> 05:45:47,788
so what what can you show them that
would basically give them a signal of

16908
05:45:47,788 --> 05:45:47,798
would basically give them a signal of
 

16909
05:45:47,798 --> 05:45:48,910
would basically give them a signal of
I'm doing this correctly or not

16910
05:45:48,910 --> 05:45:48,920
I'm doing this correctly or not
 

16911
05:45:48,920 --> 05:45:50,270
I'm doing this correctly or not
correctly so let's take this very

16912
05:45:50,270 --> 05:45:50,280
correctly so let's take this very
 

16913
05:45:50,280 --> 05:45:51,990
correctly so let's take this very
specific example like maybe your

16914
05:45:51,990 --> 05:45:52,000
specific example like maybe your
 

16915
05:45:52,000 --> 05:45:53,230
specific example like maybe your
calibration task looks like you're

16916
05:45:53,230 --> 05:45:53,240
calibration task looks like you're
 

16917
05:45:53,240 --> 05:45:54,750
calibration task looks like you're
trying to move the cursor a certain

16918
05:45:54,750 --> 05:45:54,760
trying to move the cursor a certain
 

16919
05:45:54,760 --> 05:45:56,628
trying to move the cursor a certain
position offset so your instructions to

16920
05:45:56,628 --> 05:45:56,638
position offset so your instructions to
 

16921
05:45:56,638 --> 05:45:59,390
position offset so your instructions to
the user are hey the cursor is here now

16922
05:45:59,390 --> 05:45:59,400
the user are hey the cursor is here now
 

16923
05:45:59,400 --> 05:46:00,830
the user are hey the cursor is here now
when the cursor disappears IM manag to

16924
05:46:00,830 --> 05:46:00,840
when the cursor disappears IM manag to
 

16925
05:46:00,840 --> 05:46:02,750
when the cursor disappears IM manag to
moving it 200 pixels from where it was

16926
05:46:02,750 --> 05:46:02,760
moving it 200 pixels from where it was
 

16927
05:46:02,760 --> 05:46:05,110
moving it 200 pixels from where it was
to the right to be over this Target in

16928
05:46:05,110 --> 05:46:05,120
to the right to be over this Target in
 

16929
05:46:05,120 --> 05:46:06,910
to the right to be over this Target in
that kind of scenario you could imagine

16930
05:46:06,910 --> 05:46:06,920
that kind of scenario you could imagine
 

16931
05:46:06,920 --> 05:46:08,150
that kind of scenario you could imagine
coming up with some sort of consistency

16932
05:46:08,150 --> 05:46:08,160
coming up with some sort of consistency
 

16933
05:46:08,160 --> 05:46:09,230
coming up with some sort of consistency
metric that you could display to the

16934
05:46:09,230 --> 05:46:09,240
metric that you could display to the
 

16935
05:46:09,240 --> 05:46:11,708
metric that you could display to the
user of okay I know what the spike train

16936
05:46:11,708 --> 05:46:11,718
user of okay I know what the spike train
 

16937
05:46:11,718 --> 05:46:13,310
user of okay I know what the spike train
looks like on average when you do this

16938
05:46:13,310 --> 05:46:13,320
looks like on average when you do this
 

16939
05:46:13,320 --> 05:46:15,628
looks like on average when you do this
action to the right maybe I can produce

16940
05:46:15,628 --> 05:46:15,638
action to the right maybe I can produce
 

16941
05:46:15,638 --> 05:46:17,150
action to the right maybe I can produce
some sort of probabilistic estimate of

16942
05:46:17,150 --> 05:46:17,160
some sort of probabilistic estimate of
 

16943
05:46:17,160 --> 05:46:19,670
some sort of probabilistic estimate of
How likely is that uh to be the action

16944
05:46:19,670 --> 05:46:19,680
How likely is that uh to be the action
 

16945
05:46:19,680 --> 05:46:21,510
How likely is that uh to be the action
you took given the latest trial or

16946
05:46:21,510 --> 05:46:21,520
you took given the latest trial or
 

16947
05:46:21,520 --> 05:46:23,230
you took given the latest trial or
trajectory that you that you imagined

16948
05:46:23,230 --> 05:46:23,240
trajectory that you that you imagined
 

16949
05:46:23,240 --> 05:46:24,350
trajectory that you that you imagined
and that could give the user some sort

16950
05:46:24,350 --> 05:46:24,360
and that could give the user some sort
 

16951
05:46:24,360 --> 05:46:26,110
and that could give the user some sort
of feedback of how consistent are they

16952
05:46:26,110 --> 05:46:26,120
of feedback of how consistent are they
 

16953
05:46:26,120 --> 05:46:28,430
of feedback of how consistent are they
across different trials you could also

16954
05:46:28,430 --> 05:46:28,440
across different trials you could also
 

16955
05:46:28,440 --> 05:46:31,230
across different trials you could also
imagine that if the user is prompted

16956
05:46:31,230 --> 05:46:31,240
imagine that if the user is prompted
 

16957
05:46:31,240 --> 05:46:33,230
imagine that if the user is prompted
with that kind of uh consistency metric

16958
05:46:33,230 --> 05:46:33,240
with that kind of uh consistency metric
 

16959
05:46:33,240 --> 05:46:34,190
with that kind of uh consistency metric
that maybe they just become more

16960
05:46:34,190 --> 05:46:34,200
that maybe they just become more
 

16961
05:46:34,200 --> 05:46:35,590
that maybe they just become more
behaviorally engaged to begin with

16962
05:46:35,590 --> 05:46:35,600
behaviorally engaged to begin with
 

16963
05:46:35,600 --> 05:46:37,070
behaviorally engaged to begin with
because the task is kind of boring when

16964
05:46:37,070 --> 05:46:37,080
because the task is kind of boring when
 

16965
05:46:37,080 --> 05:46:38,590
because the task is kind of boring when
you don't have any feedback at all and

16966
05:46:38,590 --> 05:46:38,600
you don't have any feedback at all and
 

16967
05:46:38,600 --> 05:46:40,830
you don't have any feedback at all and
so there may be benefits to the you know

16968
05:46:40,830 --> 05:46:40,840
so there may be benefits to the you know
 

16969
05:46:40,840 --> 05:46:42,390
so there may be benefits to the you know
the user experience of showing something

16970
05:46:42,390 --> 05:46:42,400
the user experience of showing something
 

16971
05:46:42,400 --> 05:46:43,948
the user experience of showing something
on the screen even if it's not accurate

16972
05:46:43,948 --> 05:46:43,958
on the screen even if it's not accurate
 

16973
05:46:43,958 --> 05:46:45,548
on the screen even if it's not accurate
just because it keeps the user motivated

16974
05:46:45,548 --> 05:46:45,558
just because it keeps the user motivated
 

16975
05:46:45,558 --> 05:46:47,190
just because it keeps the user motivated
to try to increase that number or push

16976
05:46:47,190 --> 05:46:47,200
to try to increase that number or push
 

16977
05:46:47,200 --> 05:46:49,430
to try to increase that number or push
it upwards so there's a p psychology

16978
05:46:49,430 --> 05:46:49,440
it upwards so there's a p psychology
 

16979
05:46:49,440 --> 05:46:52,628
it upwards so there's a p psychology
element here yeah absolutely and again

16980
05:46:52,628 --> 05:46:52,638
element here yeah absolutely and again
 

16981
05:46:52,638 --> 05:46:55,430
element here yeah absolutely and again
all of that is ux challenge how much

16982
05:46:55,430 --> 05:46:55,440
all of that is ux challenge how much
 

16983
05:46:55,440 --> 05:46:58,030
all of that is ux challenge how much
signal drift is there hour to hour day

16984
05:46:58,030 --> 05:46:58,040
signal drift is there hour to hour day
 

16985
05:46:58,040 --> 05:47:02,270
signal drift is there hour to hour day
to day week to week month to month how

16986
05:47:02,270 --> 05:47:02,280
to day week to week month to month how
 

16987
05:47:02,280 --> 05:47:05,150
to day week to week month to month how
often do you have to recalibrate because

16988
05:47:05,150 --> 05:47:05,160
often do you have to recalibrate because
 

16989
05:47:05,160 --> 05:47:07,708
often do you have to recalibrate because
of the signal drift yeah

16990
05:47:07,708 --> 05:47:07,718
of the signal drift yeah
 

16991
05:47:07,718 --> 05:47:10,070
of the signal drift yeah
uh so this is uh a problem we've worked

16992
05:47:10,070 --> 05:47:10,080
uh so this is uh a problem we've worked
 

16993
05:47:10,080 --> 05:47:12,390
uh so this is uh a problem we've worked
on both with nhp non-human primates

16994
05:47:12,390 --> 05:47:12,400
on both with nhp non-human primates
 

16995
05:47:12,400 --> 05:47:14,230
on both with nhp non-human primates
before our clinical trial and then also

16996
05:47:14,230 --> 05:47:14,240
before our clinical trial and then also
 

16997
05:47:14,240 --> 05:47:16,590
before our clinical trial and then also
with Noland during the clinical trial uh

16998
05:47:16,590 --> 05:47:16,600
with Noland during the clinical trial uh
 

16999
05:47:16,600 --> 05:47:18,030
with Noland during the clinical trial uh
maybe the first thing that's worth

17000
05:47:18,030 --> 05:47:18,040
maybe the first thing that's worth
 

17001
05:47:18,040 --> 05:47:19,310
maybe the first thing that's worth
stating is what the goal is here so the

17002
05:47:19,310 --> 05:47:19,320
stating is what the goal is here so the
 

17003
05:47:19,320 --> 05:47:20,990
stating is what the goal is here so the
goal is really to enable the user to

17004
05:47:20,990 --> 05:47:21,000
goal is really to enable the user to
 

17005
05:47:21,000 --> 05:47:22,868
goal is really to enable the user to
have a plug-and-play experience where I

17006
05:47:22,868 --> 05:47:22,878
have a plug-and-play experience where I
 

17007
05:47:22,878 --> 05:47:23,750
have a plug-and-play experience where I
guess they don't have to plug anything

17008
05:47:23,750 --> 05:47:23,760
guess they don't have to plug anything
 

17009
05:47:23,760 --> 05:47:26,230
guess they don't have to plug anything
in but a play experience where they uh

17010
05:47:26,230 --> 05:47:26,240
in but a play experience where they uh
 

17011
05:47:26,240 --> 05:47:27,430
in but a play experience where they uh
you know can use the device whenever

17012
05:47:27,430 --> 05:47:27,440
you know can use the device whenever
 

17013
05:47:27,440 --> 05:47:30,468
you know can use the device whenever
they want to however they want to and uh

17014
05:47:30,468 --> 05:47:30,478
they want to however they want to and uh
 

17015
05:47:30,478 --> 05:47:31,750
they want to however they want to and uh
that's really what we're aiming for and

17016
05:47:31,750 --> 05:47:31,760
that's really what we're aiming for and
 

17017
05:47:31,760 --> 05:47:33,868
that's really what we're aiming for and
so there can be a set of solutions that

17018
05:47:33,868 --> 05:47:33,878
so there can be a set of solutions that
 

17019
05:47:33,878 --> 05:47:36,510
so there can be a set of solutions that
get to that state without um considering

17020
05:47:36,510 --> 05:47:36,520
get to that state without um considering
 

17021
05:47:36,520 --> 05:47:38,708
get to that state without um considering
this stationarity problem so maybe the

17022
05:47:38,708 --> 05:47:38,718
this stationarity problem so maybe the
 

17023
05:47:38,718 --> 05:47:40,150
this stationarity problem so maybe the
first solution here that's important is

17024
05:47:40,150 --> 05:47:40,160
first solution here that's important is
 

17025
05:47:40,160 --> 05:47:41,430
first solution here that's important is
that they can recalibrate whenever they

17026
05:47:41,430 --> 05:47:41,440
that they can recalibrate whenever they
 

17027
05:47:41,440 --> 05:47:44,830
that they can recalibrate whenever they
want this is something that um that

17028
05:47:44,830 --> 05:47:44,840
want this is something that um that
 

17029
05:47:44,840 --> 05:47:46,468
want this is something that um that
Nolan has the ability to do today so he

17030
05:47:46,468 --> 05:47:46,478
Nolan has the ability to do today so he
 

17031
05:47:46,478 --> 05:47:47,868
Nolan has the ability to do today so he
can recalibrate the system you know at 2

17032
05:47:47,868 --> 05:47:47,878
can recalibrate the system you know at 2
 

17033
05:47:47,878 --> 05:47:49,548
can recalibrate the system you know at 2
am in the middle of the night without

05:47:49,548 --> 05:47:49,558
am in the middle of the night without
 

17035
05:47:49,558 --> 05:47:51,070

his you know caretaker or parents or

17036
05:47:51,070 --> 05:47:51,080
his you know caretaker or parents or
 

17037
05:47:51,080 --> 05:47:52,510

friends around to help push a button for

17038
05:47:52,510 --> 05:47:52,520
friends around to help push a button for
 

17039
05:47:52,520 --> 05:47:54,788
friends around to help push a button for
him the other uh important part of the

17040
05:47:54,788 --> 05:47:54,798
him the other uh important part of the
 

17041
05:47:54,798 --> 05:47:56,070
him the other uh important part of the
solution is that when you have a good

17042
05:47:56,070 --> 05:47:56,080
solution is that when you have a good
 

17043
05:47:56,080 --> 05:47:57,670
solution is that when you have a good
model calibrated that you can continue

17044
05:47:57,670 --> 05:47:57,680
model calibrated that you can continue
 

17045
05:47:57,680 --> 05:47:58,590
model calibrated that you can continue
using that without needing to

17046
05:47:58,590 --> 05:47:58,600
using that without needing to
 

17047
05:47:58,600 --> 05:48:01,230
using that without needing to
recalibrate it so how often he has to do

17048
05:48:01,230 --> 05:48:01,240
recalibrate it so how often he has to do
 

17049
05:48:01,240 --> 05:48:02,830
recalibrate it so how often he has to do
this recalibration T depends really on

17050
05:48:02,830 --> 05:48:02,840
this recalibration T depends really on
 

17051
05:48:02,840 --> 05:48:05,430
this recalibration T depends really on
his appetite for performance there are

05:48:05,430 --> 05:48:05,440
his appetite for performance there are
 

17053
05:48:05,440 --> 05:48:07,750
his appetite for performance there are
uh we observe sort of a degradation

17054
05:48:07,750 --> 05:48:07,760
uh we observe sort of a degradation
 

17055
05:48:07,760 --> 05:48:09,948
uh we observe sort of a degradation
through time of how well any individual

17056
05:48:09,948 --> 05:48:09,958
through time of how well any individual
 

17057
05:48:09,958 --> 05:48:11,788
through time of how well any individual
model works but this can be mitigated

17058
05:48:11,788 --> 05:48:11,798
model works but this can be mitigated
 

17059
05:48:11,798 --> 05:48:13,390
model works but this can be mitigated
behaviorally by the user adapting their

17060
05:48:13,390 --> 05:48:13,400
behaviorally by the user adapting their
 

17061
05:48:13,400 --> 05:48:15,030
behaviorally by the user adapting their
control strategy it can also be

17062
05:48:15,030 --> 05:48:15,040
control strategy it can also be
 

17063
05:48:15,040 --> 05:48:16,468
control strategy it can also be
mitigated through a combination of sort

17064
05:48:16,468 --> 05:48:16,478
mitigated through a combination of sort
 

17065
05:48:16,478 --> 05:48:18,070
mitigated through a combination of sort
of software features that we we provide

17066
05:48:18,070 --> 05:48:18,080
of software features that we we provide
 

17067
05:48:18,080 --> 05:48:20,030
of software features that we we provide
to the user for example we let the user

17068
05:48:20,030 --> 05:48:20,040
to the user for example we let the user
 

17069
05:48:20,040 --> 05:48:22,150
to the user for example we let the user
adjust exactly how fast the cursor is

17070
05:48:22,150 --> 05:48:22,160
adjust exactly how fast the cursor is
 

17071
05:48:22,160 --> 05:48:24,190
adjust exactly how fast the cursor is
moving uh we call that the gain for

17072
05:48:24,190 --> 05:48:24,200
moving uh we call that the gain for
 

17073
05:48:24,200 --> 05:48:25,708
moving uh we call that the gain for
example the gain of how fast the cursor

17074
05:48:25,708 --> 05:48:25,718
example the gain of how fast the cursor
 

17075
05:48:25,718 --> 05:48:27,830
example the gain of how fast the cursor
reacts to Any Given input intention they

17076
05:48:27,830 --> 05:48:27,840
reacts to Any Given input intention they
 

17077
05:48:27,840 --> 05:48:30,350
reacts to Any Given input intention they
can also adjust the smoothing how smooth

17078
05:48:30,350 --> 05:48:30,360
can also adjust the smoothing how smooth
 

17079
05:48:30,360 --> 05:48:31,830
can also adjust the smoothing how smooth
the output of that cursor in tension

17080
05:48:31,830 --> 05:48:31,840
the output of that cursor in tension
 

17081
05:48:31,840 --> 05:48:33,548
the output of that cursor in tension
actually is they can also adjust the

17082
05:48:33,548 --> 05:48:33,558
actually is they can also adjust the
 

17083
05:48:33,558 --> 05:48:35,070
actually is they can also adjust the
friction which is how easy is it to stop

17084
05:48:35,070 --> 05:48:35,080
friction which is how easy is it to stop

05:48:39,040 --> 05:48:40,310
tools allow the user a great deal of
flexibility and troubleshooting

17090
05:48:40,310 --> 05:48:40,320
flexibility and troubleshooting
 

17091
05:48:40,320 --> 05:48:41,510
flexibility and troubleshooting
mechanisms to be able to solve this

17092
05:48:41,510 --> 05:48:41,520
mechanisms to be able to solve this
 

17093
05:48:41,520 --> 05:48:42,788
mechanisms to be able to solve this
problem for themselves by the way all

17094
05:48:42,788 --> 05:48:42,798
problem for themselves by the way all
 

17095
05:48:42,798 --> 05:48:45,110
problem for themselves by the way all
this is done by looking to the right

17096
05:48:45,110 --> 05:48:45,120
this is done by looking to the right
 

17097
05:48:45,120 --> 05:48:47,350
this is done by looking to the right
side of the screen selecting the mixer

17098
05:48:47,350 --> 05:48:47,360
side of the screen selecting the mixer
 

17099
05:48:47,360 --> 05:48:48,910
side of the screen selecting the mixer
and in the mixer you have it's it's like

17100
05:48:48,910 --> 05:48:48,920
and in the mixer you have it's it's like
 

17101
05:48:48,920 --> 05:48:52,670
and in the mixer you have it's it's like
DJ mode DJ mode for your BCI so I mean

17102
05:48:52,670 --> 05:48:52,680
DJ mode DJ mode for your BCI so I mean
 

17103
05:48:52,680 --> 05:48:54,548
DJ mode DJ mode for your BCI so I mean
it's a really well done interface it's

17104
05:48:54,548 --> 05:48:54,558
it's a really well done interface it's
 

17105
05:48:54,558 --> 05:48:56,510
it's a really well done interface it's
really really well done and so yeah

17106
05:48:56,510 --> 05:48:56,520
really really well done and so yeah
 

17107
05:48:56,520 --> 05:48:59,230
really really well done and so yeah
there's that bias uh that there's a

17108
05:48:59,230 --> 05:48:59,240
there's that bias uh that there's a
 

17109
05:48:59,240 --> 05:49:01,548
there's that bias uh that there's a
cursor drift that Nolan talked about in

17110
05:49:01,548 --> 05:49:01,558
cursor drift that Nolan talked about in
 

17111
05:49:01,558 --> 05:49:05,230
cursor drift that Nolan talked about in
a stream uh although he said that uh you

17112
05:49:05,230 --> 05:49:05,240
a stream uh although he said that uh you
 

17113
05:49:05,240 --> 05:49:06,510
a stream uh although he said that uh you
guys were just playing around with it

17114
05:49:06,510 --> 05:49:06,520
guys were just playing around with it
 

17115
05:49:06,520 --> 05:49:08,030
guys were just playing around with it
with him and they're constantly

17116
05:49:08,030 --> 05:49:08,040
with him and they're constantly
 

17117
05:49:08,040 --> 05:49:09,830
with him and they're constantly
improving so that could have been just a

17118
05:49:09,830 --> 05:49:09,840
improving so that could have been just a
 

17119
05:49:09,840 --> 05:49:11,868
improving so that could have been just a
snapshot of that particular moment

17120
05:49:11,868 --> 05:49:11,878
snapshot of that particular moment
 

17121
05:49:11,878 --> 05:49:13,830
snapshot of that particular moment
particular day but he said that there

17122
05:49:13,830 --> 05:49:13,840
particular day but he said that there
 

17123
05:49:13,840 --> 05:49:18,628
particular day but he said that there
was uh this cursor drift and this bias

17124
05:49:18,628 --> 05:49:18,638
was uh this cursor drift and this bias
 

17125
05:49:18,638 --> 05:49:21,110
was uh this cursor drift and this bias
that could be removed by him I guess

17126
05:49:21,110 --> 05:49:21,120
that could be removed by him I guess
 

17127
05:49:21,120 --> 05:49:22,350
that could be removed by him I guess
looking to the right side of the screen

17128
05:49:22,350 --> 05:49:22,360
looking to the right side of the screen
 

17129
05:49:22,360 --> 05:49:23,948
looking to the right side of the screen
or left side of the screen to kind of

17130
05:49:23,948 --> 05:49:23,958
or left side of the screen to kind of
 

17131
05:49:23,958 --> 05:49:26,708
or left side of the screen to kind of
adjust the bias that's one interface

17132
05:49:26,708 --> 05:49:26,718
adjust the bias that's one interface
 

17133
05:49:26,718 --> 05:49:28,830
adjust the bias that's one interface
action I guess to adjust the bias yeah

17134
05:49:28,830 --> 05:49:28,840
action I guess to adjust the bias yeah
 

17135
05:49:28,840 --> 05:49:30,670
action I guess to adjust the bias yeah
so this is actually an idea idea that

17136
05:49:30,670 --> 05:49:30,680
so this is actually an idea idea that
 

17137
05:49:30,680 --> 05:49:33,350
so this is actually an idea idea that
comes out of Academia um there there is

17138
05:49:33,350 --> 05:49:33,360
comes out of Academia um there there is
 

17139
05:49:33,360 --> 05:49:35,750
comes out of Academia um there there is
some prior work with uh uh sort of

17140
05:49:35,750 --> 05:49:35,760
some prior work with uh uh sort of
 

17141
05:49:35,760 --> 05:49:37,190
some prior work with uh uh sort of
BrainGate clinical TR participants where

17142
05:49:37,190 --> 05:49:37,200
BrainGate clinical TR participants where
 

17143
05:49:37,200 --> 05:49:38,590
BrainGate clinical TR participants where
they pioneered this idea of bias

17144
05:49:38,590 --> 05:49:38,600
they pioneered this idea of bias
 

17145
05:49:38,600 --> 05:49:40,270
they pioneered this idea of bias
correction the way we've done it I think

17146
05:49:40,270 --> 05:49:40,280
correction the way we've done it I think
 

17147
05:49:40,280 --> 05:49:43,350
correction the way we've done it I think
is yeah it's very przed very uh uh

17148
05:49:43,350 --> 05:49:43,360
is yeah it's very przed very uh uh
 

17149
05:49:43,360 --> 05:49:45,030
is yeah it's very przed very uh uh
beautiful user experience where the user

17150
05:49:45,030 --> 05:49:45,040
beautiful user experience where the user
 

17151
05:49:45,040 --> 05:49:47,590
beautiful user experience where the user
can essentially um Flash the cursor over

17152
05:49:47,590 --> 05:49:47,600
can essentially um Flash the cursor over
 

17153
05:49:47,600 --> 05:49:48,868
can essentially um Flash the cursor over
to the side of the screen and it opens

17154
05:49:48,868 --> 05:49:48,878
to the side of the screen and it opens
 

17155
05:49:48,878 --> 05:49:51,510
to the side of the screen and it opens
up a window where they can actually uh

17156
05:49:51,510 --> 05:49:51,520
up a window where they can actually uh
 

17157
05:49:51,520 --> 05:49:53,590
up a window where they can actually uh
sort of adjust or tune exactly the the

17158
05:49:53,590 --> 05:49:53,600
sort of adjust or tune exactly the the
 

17159
05:49:53,600 --> 05:49:55,468
sort of adjust or tune exactly the the
bias of the cursor so bias maybe for

17160
05:49:55,468 --> 05:49:55,478
bias of the cursor so bias maybe for
 

17161
05:49:55,478 --> 05:49:56,670
bias of the cursor so bias maybe for
people who aren't familiar is just sort

17162
05:49:56,670 --> 05:49:56,680
people who aren't familiar is just sort
 

17163
05:49:56,680 --> 05:49:58,110
people who aren't familiar is just sort
of what is the default motion of the

17164
05:49:58,110 --> 05:49:58,120
of what is the default motion of the
 

17165
05:49:58,120 --> 05:50:00,070
of what is the default motion of the
cursor if you're imagining nothing and

17166
05:50:00,070 --> 05:50:00,080
cursor if you're imagining nothing and
 

17167
05:50:00,080 --> 05:50:01,310
cursor if you're imagining nothing and
it turns out that that's one of the

17168
05:50:01,310 --> 05:50:01,320
it turns out that that's one of the
 

17169
05:50:01,320 --> 05:50:04,750
it turns out that that's one of the
first um first sort of qualia of the

17170
05:50:04,750 --> 05:50:04,760
first um first sort of qualia of the
 

17171
05:50:04,760 --> 05:50:05,868
first um first sort of qualia of the
cursor control experience that's

17172
05:50:05,868 --> 05:50:05,878
cursor control experience that's
 

17173
05:50:05,878 --> 05:50:08,230
cursor control experience that's
impacted by neur aity quality of the

17174
05:50:08,230 --> 05:50:08,240
impacted by neur aity quality of the
 

17175
05:50:08,240 --> 05:50:09,468
impacted by neur aity quality of the
cursor experi I don't know how else to

17176
05:50:09,468 --> 05:50:09,478
cursor experi I don't know how else to
 

17177
05:50:09,478 --> 05:50:11,430
cursor experi I don't know how else to
describe it like you know I'm not the

17178
05:50:11,430 --> 05:50:11,440
describe it like you know I'm not the
 

17179
05:50:11,440 --> 05:50:13,788
describe it like you know I'm not the
I'm not the guy very poetic I love it

17180
05:50:13,788 --> 05:50:13,798
I'm not the guy very poetic I love it
 

17181
05:50:13,798 --> 05:50:15,590
I'm not the guy very poetic I love it
the quality of the cursor experience

17182
05:50:15,590 --> 05:50:15,600
the quality of the cursor experience
 

17183
05:50:15,600 --> 05:50:18,150
the quality of the cursor experience
yeah I mean it's it sounds poetic but it

17184
05:50:18,150 --> 05:50:18,160
yeah I mean it's it sounds poetic but it
 

17185
05:50:18,160 --> 05:50:21,070
yeah I mean it's it sounds poetic but it
is uh deeply true there is an experience

17186
05:50:21,070 --> 05:50:21,080
is uh deeply true there is an experience
 

17187
05:50:21,080 --> 05:50:26,110
is uh deeply true there is an experience
when it works well it is a joyful a

17188
05:50:26,110 --> 05:50:26,120
when it works well it is a joyful a
 

17189
05:50:26,120 --> 05:50:27,910
when it works well it is a joyful a
really pleasant experience and when it

17190
05:50:27,910 --> 05:50:27,920
really pleasant experience and when it
 

17191
05:50:27,920 --> 05:50:28,948
really pleasant experience and when it
doesn't work well it's a very

17192
05:50:28,948 --> 05:50:28,958
doesn't work well it's a very
 

17193
05:50:28,958 --> 05:50:30,948
doesn't work well it's a very
frustrating experience that's actually

17194
05:50:30,948 --> 05:50:30,958
frustrating experience that's actually
 

17195
05:50:30,958 --> 05:50:32,590
frustrating experience that's actually
the art of

17196
05:50:32,590 --> 05:50:32,600
the art of
 

17197
05:50:32,600 --> 05:50:35,548
the art of
ux it's like you have the possibility to

17198
05:50:35,548 --> 05:50:35,558
ux it's like you have the possibility to
 

17199
05:50:35,558 --> 05:50:37,990
ux it's like you have the possibility to
frustrate people or the possibility to

17200
05:50:37,990 --> 05:50:38,000
frustrate people or the possibility to
 

17201
05:50:38,000 --> 05:50:39,030
frustrate people or the possibility to
give them

17202
05:50:39,030 --> 05:50:39,040
give them
 

17203
05:50:39,040 --> 05:50:41,070
give them
joy and at the end of the day it really

17204
05:50:41,070 --> 05:50:41,080
joy and at the end of the day it really
 

17205
05:50:41,080 --> 05:50:43,030
joy and at the end of the day it really
is truly the case that ux is how the

17206
05:50:43,030 --> 05:50:43,040
is truly the case that ux is how the
 

17207
05:50:43,040 --> 05:50:44,830
is truly the case that ux is how the
thing works and so it's not just like

17208
05:50:44,830 --> 05:50:44,840
thing works and so it's not just like
 

17209
05:50:44,840 --> 05:50:46,628
thing works and so it's not just like
what's showing on the screen it's also

17210
05:50:46,628 --> 05:50:46,638
what's showing on the screen it's also
 

17211
05:50:46,638 --> 05:50:48,230
what's showing on the screen it's also
you know what control surfaces does a

17212
05:50:48,230 --> 05:50:48,240
you know what control surfaces does a
 

17213
05:50:48,240 --> 05:50:50,230
you know what control surfaces does a
dcard provide the user like we want them

17214
05:50:50,230 --> 05:50:50,240
dcard provide the user like we want them
 

17215
05:50:50,240 --> 05:50:51,750
dcard provide the user like we want them
to feel like they're in the F1 car not

17216
05:50:51,750 --> 05:50:51,760
to feel like they're in the F1 car not
 

17217
05:50:51,760 --> 05:50:54,310
to feel like they're in the F1 car not
like the you know some like minivan

17218
05:50:54,310 --> 05:50:54,320
like the you know some like minivan
 

17219
05:50:54,320 --> 05:50:56,110
like the you know some like minivan
right you and that really truly is how

17220
05:50:56,110 --> 05:50:56,120
right you and that really truly is how
 

17221
05:50:56,120 --> 05:50:57,868
right you and that really truly is how
we think about it um Nolan himself is an

17222
05:50:57,868 --> 05:50:57,878
we think about it um Nolan himself is an
 

17223
05:50:57,878 --> 05:51:00,350
we think about it um Nolan himself is an
F1 fan so um we refer to oursel as a

17224
05:51:00,350 --> 05:51:00,360
F1 fan so um we refer to oursel as a
 

17225
05:51:00,360 --> 05:51:02,350
F1 fan so um we refer to oursel as a
pick crew he really is truly the the F1

17226
05:51:02,350 --> 05:51:02,360
pick crew he really is truly the the F1
 

17227
05:51:02,360 --> 05:51:04,230
pick crew he really is truly the the F1
driver and there's different you know

17228
05:51:04,230 --> 05:51:04,240
driver and there's different you know
 

17229
05:51:04,240 --> 05:51:05,910
driver and there's different you know
control surfaces that that different

17230
05:51:05,910 --> 05:51:05,920
control surfaces that that different
 

17231
05:51:05,920 --> 05:51:07,948
control surfaces that that different
kinds of cars and airplanes provide the

17232
05:51:07,948 --> 05:51:07,958
kinds of cars and airplanes provide the
 

17233
05:51:07,958 --> 05:51:09,670
kinds of cars and airplanes provide the
user and we take a lot of inspiration

17234
05:51:09,670 --> 05:51:09,680
user and we take a lot of inspiration
 

17235
05:51:09,680 --> 05:51:10,948
user and we take a lot of inspiration
from that when designing how the cursor

17236
05:51:10,948 --> 05:51:10,958
from that when designing how the cursor
 

17237
05:51:10,958 --> 05:51:13,310
from that when designing how the cursor
should behave and maybe one Nuance of

17238
05:51:13,310 --> 05:51:13,320
should behave and maybe one Nuance of
 

17239
05:51:13,320 --> 05:51:15,510
should behave and maybe one Nuance of
this is you know even details like when

17240
05:51:15,510 --> 05:51:15,520
this is you know even details like when
 

17241
05:51:15,520 --> 05:51:17,868
this is you know even details like when
you move a mouse on a MacBook trackpad

17242
05:51:17,868 --> 05:51:17,878
you move a mouse on a MacBook trackpad
 

17243
05:51:17,878 --> 05:51:20,430
you move a mouse on a MacBook trackpad
the sort of response curve of how that

17244
05:51:20,430 --> 05:51:20,440
the sort of response curve of how that
 

17245
05:51:20,440 --> 05:51:22,788
the sort of response curve of how that
uh input that you give the trackpad

17246
05:51:22,788 --> 05:51:22,798
uh input that you give the trackpad
 

17247
05:51:22,798 --> 05:51:24,390
uh input that you give the trackpad
translates to cursor movement is

17248
05:51:24,390 --> 05:51:24,400
translates to cursor movement is
 

17249
05:51:24,400 --> 05:51:26,270
translates to cursor movement is
different than how it works with a mouse

17250
05:51:26,270 --> 05:51:26,280
different than how it works with a mouse
 

17251
05:51:26,280 --> 05:51:27,788
different than how it works with a mouse
when you move on the trackpad there's a

17252
05:51:27,788 --> 05:51:27,798
when you move on the trackpad there's a
 

17253
05:51:27,798 --> 05:51:28,990
when you move on the trackpad there's a
different response function a different

17254
05:51:28,990 --> 05:51:29,000
different response function a different
 

17255
05:51:29,000 --> 05:51:30,708
different response function a different
curve to how much a movement translates

17256
05:51:30,708 --> 05:51:30,718
curve to how much a movement translates
 

17257
05:51:30,718 --> 05:51:32,150
curve to how much a movement translates
to input to the computer than when you

17258
05:51:32,150 --> 05:51:32,160
to input to the computer than when you
 

17259
05:51:32,160 --> 05:51:33,548
to input to the computer than when you
do it physically with the mouse and

17260
05:51:33,548 --> 05:51:33,558
do it physically with the mouse and
 

17261
05:51:33,558 --> 05:51:35,270
do it physically with the mouse and
that's because somebody sat down a long

17262
05:51:35,270 --> 05:51:35,280
that's because somebody sat down a long
 

17263
05:51:35,280 --> 05:51:36,230
that's because somebody sat down a long
time ago when they're designed the

17264
05:51:36,230 --> 05:51:36,240
time ago when they're designed the
 

17265
05:51:36,240 --> 05:51:38,670
time ago when they're designed the
initial input systems to any computer

17266
05:51:38,670 --> 05:51:38,680
initial input systems to any computer
 

17267
05:51:38,680 --> 05:51:40,868
initial input systems to any computer
and they thought through exactly how uh

17268
05:51:40,868 --> 05:51:40,878
and they thought through exactly how uh
 

17269
05:51:40,878 --> 05:51:42,910
and they thought through exactly how uh
it feels to use these different systems

17270
05:51:42,910 --> 05:51:42,920
it feels to use these different systems
 

17271
05:51:42,920 --> 05:51:44,150
it feels to use these different systems
and now we're designing sort of the next

17272
05:51:44,150 --> 05:51:44,160
and now we're designing sort of the next
 

17273
05:51:44,160 --> 05:51:45,788
and now we're designing sort of the next
generation of this input system to a

17274
05:51:45,788 --> 05:51:45,798
generation of this input system to a
 

17275
05:51:45,798 --> 05:51:47,548
generation of this input system to a
computer which is entirely done via the

17276
05:51:47,548 --> 05:51:47,558
computer which is entirely done via the
 

17277
05:51:47,558 --> 05:51:50,270
computer which is entirely done via the
brain and there's no proceptive feedback

17278
05:51:50,270 --> 05:51:50,280
brain and there's no proceptive feedback
 

17279
05:51:50,280 --> 05:51:51,510
brain and there's no proceptive feedback
again you don't feel the mouse in your

17280
05:51:51,510 --> 05:51:51,520
again you don't feel the mouse in your
 

17281
05:51:51,520 --> 05:51:53,230
again you don't feel the mouse in your
hand you don't feel the keys under your

17282
05:51:53,230 --> 05:51:53,240
hand you don't feel the keys under your
 

17283
05:51:53,240 --> 05:51:55,230
hand you don't feel the keys under your
fingertips and you want a control

17284
05:51:55,230 --> 05:51:55,240
fingertips and you want a control
 

17285
05:51:55,240 --> 05:51:56,590
fingertips and you want a control
surface that still makes it easy and

17286
05:51:56,590 --> 05:51:56,600
surface that still makes it easy and
 

17287
05:51:56,600 --> 05:51:57,788
surface that still makes it easy and
intuitive for the user to understand the

17288
05:51:57,788 --> 05:51:57,798
intuitive for the user to understand the
 

17289
05:51:57,798 --> 05:51:59,230
intuitive for the user to understand the
state of the system and how to achieve

17290
05:51:59,230 --> 05:51:59,240
state of the system and how to achieve
 

17291
05:51:59,240 --> 05:52:01,270
state of the system and how to achieve
what they want to achieve and ultimately

17292
05:52:01,270 --> 05:52:01,280
what they want to achieve and ultimately
 

17293
05:52:01,280 --> 05:52:03,150
what they want to achieve and ultimately
the end goal is that that ux is

17294
05:52:03,150 --> 05:52:03,160
the end goal is that that ux is
 

17295
05:52:03,160 --> 05:52:04,670
the end goal is that that ux is
completely Fades into the background it

17296
05:52:04,670 --> 05:52:04,680
completely Fades into the background it
 

17297
05:52:04,680 --> 05:52:06,190
completely Fades into the background it
becomes something that's so natural and

17298
05:52:06,190 --> 05:52:06,200
becomes something that's so natural and
 

17299
05:52:06,200 --> 05:52:07,510
becomes something that's so natural and
intuitive that is subconscious to the

17300
05:52:07,510 --> 05:52:07,520
intuitive that is subconscious to the
 

17301
05:52:07,520 --> 05:52:09,468
intuitive that is subconscious to the
user and they just should feel like they

17302
05:52:09,468 --> 05:52:09,478
user and they just should feel like they
 

17303
05:52:09,478 --> 05:52:11,590
user and they just should feel like they
have basically direct control over the

17304
05:52:11,590 --> 05:52:11,600
have basically direct control over the
 

17305
05:52:11,600 --> 05:52:13,030
have basically direct control over the
cursor just does what they want it to do

17306
05:52:13,030 --> 05:52:13,040
cursor just does what they want it to do
 

17307
05:52:13,040 --> 05:52:13,868
cursor just does what they want it to do
they're not thinking about the

17308
05:52:13,868 --> 05:52:13,878
they're not thinking about the
 

17309
05:52:13,878 --> 05:52:15,150
they're not thinking about the
implementation of how to make it do what

17310
05:52:15,150 --> 05:52:15,160
implementation of how to make it do what
 

17311
05:52:15,160 --> 05:52:16,628
implementation of how to make it do what
they want it to do it's just doing what

17312
05:52:16,628 --> 05:52:16,638
they want it to do it's just doing what
 

17313
05:52:16,638 --> 05:52:19,788
they want it to do it's just doing what
they want it to do is there some kind of

17314
05:52:19,788 --> 05:52:19,798
they want it to do is there some kind of
 

17315
05:52:19,798 --> 05:52:22,628
they want it to do is there some kind of
things along the lines of like Fitz law

17316
05:52:22,628 --> 05:52:22,638
things along the lines of like Fitz law
 

17317
05:52:22,638 --> 05:52:24,430
things along the lines of like Fitz law
where you should move the mouse in a

17318
05:52:24,430 --> 05:52:24,440
where you should move the mouse in a
 

17319
05:52:24,440 --> 05:52:26,350
where you should move the mouse in a
certain kind of way that maximizes your

17320
05:52:26,350 --> 05:52:26,360
certain kind of way that maximizes your
 

17321
05:52:26,360 --> 05:52:29,510
certain kind of way that maximizes your
chance to hit the target uh I don't even

17322
05:52:29,510 --> 05:52:29,520

chance to hit the target uh I don't even
know what I'm asking but I'm hoping the

but uh there's definitely some things
 

17347
05:53:02,440 --> 05:53:05,990
but uh there's definitely some things
we've learned that uh make it uh easier

we've learned that uh make it uh easier

it's pretty straightforward when you
when you verbalize it but it takes a

know neurons firing and so you want to
 

17447
05:54:36,000 --> 05:54:38,270
know neurons firing and so you want to
be very sure that that click is correct

be very sure that that click is correct
 

17449
05:54:38,280 --> 05:54:39,468
be very sure that that click is correct
because a false click can be very

half composed and reads funny after you
 

17465
05:54:51,478 --> 05:54:53,270
half composed and reads funny after you
uh so you know there's different sort of

that is when it's wrong still useful to
 

17475
05:55:01,080 --> 05:55:03,990
that is when it's wrong still useful to
the end user that's so fascinating that

17476
05:55:03,990 --> 05:55:04,000
the end user that's so fascinating that
 

17477
05:55:04,000 --> 05:55:05,310
the end user that's so fascinating that
assigning

17478
05:55:05,310 --> 05:55:05,320
assigning
 

17479
05:55:05,320 --> 05:55:09,670
assigning
cost to every action when uh an error

17480
05:55:09,670 --> 05:55:09,680
cost to every action when uh an error
 

17481
05:55:09,680 --> 05:55:12,150
cost to every action when uh an error
occurs so every action if an error

17482
05:55:12,150 --> 05:55:12,160
occurs so every action if an error
 

17483
05:55:12,160 --> 05:55:14,070
occurs so every action if an error
occurs has a certain

17484
05:55:14,070 --> 05:55:14,080
occurs has a certain
 

17485
05:55:14,080 --> 05:55:18,110
occurs has a certain
cost and incorporating that into how you

17486
05:55:18,110 --> 05:55:18,120
cost and incorporating that into how you
 

17487
05:55:18,120 --> 05:55:20,750
cost and incorporating that into how you
interpret the intention mapping it to

17488
05:55:20,750 --> 05:55:20,760
interpret the intention mapping it to
 

17489
05:55:20,760 --> 05:55:24,910
interpret the intention mapping it to
the action is really important I didn't

17490
05:55:24,910 --> 05:55:24,920
the action is really important I didn't
 

17491
05:55:24,920 --> 05:55:27,230
the action is really important I didn't
quite until you said it realize there's

17492
05:55:27,230 --> 05:55:27,240
quite until you said it realize there's
 

17493
05:55:27,240 --> 05:55:30,430
quite until you said it realize there's
a cost to like sending the text early

17494
05:55:30,430 --> 05:55:30,440
a cost to like sending the text early
 

17495
05:55:30,440 --> 05:55:32,270
a cost to like sending the text early
it's like a very expensive cost it's

17496
05:55:32,270 --> 05:55:32,280
it's like a very expensive cost it's
 

17497
05:55:32,280 --> 05:55:33,868
it's like a very expensive cost it's
super annoying if you accidentally like

17498
05:55:33,868 --> 05:55:33,878
super annoying if you accidentally like
 

17499
05:55:33,878 --> 05:55:35,110
super annoying if you accidentally like
if you're a cursor imagine if your

17500
05:55:35,110 --> 05:55:35,120
if you're a cursor imagine if your
 

17501
05:55:35,120 --> 05:55:37,390
if you're a cursor imagine if your
cursor misclicked every once in a while

17502
05:55:37,390 --> 05:55:37,400
cursor misclicked every once in a while
 

17503
05:55:37,400 --> 05:55:38,628
cursor misclicked every once in a while
that's like super obnoxious and the

17504
05:55:38,628 --> 05:55:38,638
that's like super obnoxious and the
 

17505
05:55:38,638 --> 05:55:40,468
that's like super obnoxious and the
worst part of it is usually when the

17506
05:55:40,468 --> 05:55:40,478
worst part of it is usually when the
 

17507
05:55:40,478 --> 05:55:42,548
worst part of it is usually when the
user is trying to click they're also

17508
05:55:42,548 --> 05:55:42,558
user is trying to click they're also
 

17509
05:55:42,558 --> 05:55:43,868
user is trying to click they're also
holding still because they're over the

17510
05:55:43,868 --> 05:55:43,878
holding still because they're over the
 

17511
05:55:43,878 --> 05:55:44,910
holding still because they're over the
target they want to hit and they're

17512
05:55:44,910 --> 05:55:44,920
target they want to hit and they're
 

17513
05:55:44,920 --> 05:55:46,910
target they want to hit and they're
getting ready to click which means that

17514
05:55:46,910 --> 05:55:46,920
getting ready to click which means that
 

17515
05:55:46,920 --> 05:55:48,670
getting ready to click which means that
in the data sets that we build on

17516
05:55:48,670 --> 05:55:48,680
in the data sets that we build on
 

17517
05:55:48,680 --> 05:55:50,310
in the data sets that we build on
average is the case that sort of low

17518
05:55:50,310 --> 05:55:50,320
average is the case that sort of low
 

17519
05:55:50,320 --> 05:55:52,030
average is the case that sort of low
speeds or desire to hold still it's

17520
05:55:52,030 --> 05:55:52,040
speeds or desire to hold still it's
 

17521
05:55:52,040 --> 05:55:53,110
speeds or desire to hold still it's
correlated with when the user is

17522
05:55:53,110 --> 05:55:53,120
correlated with when the user is
 

17523
05:55:53,120 --> 05:55:55,468
correlated with when the user is
attempting to click wow that is really

17524
05:55:55,468 --> 05:55:55,478
attempting to click wow that is really
 

17525
05:55:55,478 --> 05:55:57,430
attempting to click wow that is really
fascinating it's also it's also not the

17526
05:55:57,430 --> 05:55:57,440
fascinating it's also it's also not the
 

17527
05:55:57,440 --> 05:55:58,948
fascinating it's also it's also not the
case you know people think that oh click

17528
05:55:58,948 --> 05:55:58,958
case you know people think that oh click
 

17529
05:55:58,958 --> 05:56:00,468
case you know people think that oh click
is a binary signal this must be super

17530
05:56:00,468 --> 05:56:00,478
is a binary signal this must be super
 

17531
05:56:00,478 --> 05:56:03,350
is a binary signal this must be super
easy to decode well yes it is but the

17532
05:56:03,350 --> 05:56:03,360
easy to decode well yes it is but the
 

17533
05:56:03,360 --> 05:56:05,270
easy to decode well yes it is but the
bar is so much higher for it to become a

17534
05:56:05,270 --> 05:56:05,280
bar is so much higher for it to become a
 

17535
05:56:05,280 --> 05:56:06,750
bar is so much higher for it to become a
useful thing for the user

17536
05:56:06,750 --> 05:56:06,760
useful thing for the user
 

17537
05:56:06,760 --> 05:56:07,830
useful thing for the user
and there's ways to solve this I mean

17538
05:56:07,830 --> 05:56:07,840
and there's ways to solve this I mean
 

17539
05:56:07,840 --> 05:56:08,948
and there's ways to solve this I mean
you can sort of take the compound

17540
05:56:08,948 --> 05:56:08,958
you can sort of take the compound
 

17541
05:56:08,958 --> 05:56:10,830
you can sort of take the compound
approach of well let's just give the

17542
05:56:10,830 --> 05:56:10,840
approach of well let's just give the
 

17543
05:56:10,840 --> 05:56:12,390
approach of well let's just give the
like Let's Take 5 Seconds to click let's

17544
05:56:12,390 --> 05:56:12,400
like Let's Take 5 Seconds to click let's
 

17545
05:56:12,400 --> 05:56:13,708
like Let's Take 5 Seconds to click let's
take a huge window of time so we can be

17546
05:56:13,708 --> 05:56:13,718
take a huge window of time so we can be
 

17547
05:56:13,718 --> 05:56:15,310
take a huge window of time so we can be
very confident about the answer but

17548
05:56:15,310 --> 05:56:15,320
very confident about the answer but
 

17549
05:56:15,320 --> 05:56:16,990
very confident about the answer but
again world's best Mouse the world's

17550
05:56:16,990 --> 05:56:17,000
again world's best Mouse the world's
 

17551
05:56:17,000 --> 05:56:18,190
again world's best Mouse the world's
best Mouse doesn't take a second to

17552
05:56:18,190 --> 05:56:18,200
best Mouse doesn't take a second to
 

17553
05:56:18,200 --> 05:56:19,548
best Mouse doesn't take a second to
click or 500 milliseconds to click it

17554
05:56:19,548 --> 05:56:19,558
click or 500 milliseconds to click it
 

17555
05:56:19,558 --> 05:56:22,590
click or 500 milliseconds to click it
takes five milliseconds to click or less

17556
05:56:22,590 --> 05:56:22,600
takes five milliseconds to click or less
 

17557
05:56:22,600 --> 05:56:24,030
takes five milliseconds to click or less
and so if you're aiming for that kind of

17558
05:56:24,030 --> 05:56:24,040
and so if you're aiming for that kind of
 

17559
05:56:24,040 --> 05:56:25,510
and so if you're aiming for that kind of
high bar then you really want to solve

17560
05:56:25,510 --> 05:56:25,520
high bar then you really want to solve
 

17561
05:56:25,520 --> 05:56:27,150
high bar then you really want to solve
the underlying problem so maybe this is

17562
05:56:27,150 --> 05:56:27,160
the underlying problem so maybe this is
 

17563
05:56:27,160 --> 05:56:28,948
the underlying problem so maybe this is
a good place to ask about how to measure

17564
05:56:28,948 --> 05:56:28,958
a good place to ask about how to measure
 

17565
05:56:28,958 --> 05:56:31,150
a good place to ask about how to measure
performance this whole bits per second

17566
05:56:31,150 --> 05:56:31,160
performance this whole bits per second
 

17567
05:56:31,160 --> 05:56:35,030
performance this whole bits per second
what uh can you like explain what you

17568
05:56:35,030 --> 05:56:35,040
what uh can you like explain what you
 

17569
05:56:35,040 --> 05:56:37,590
what uh can you like explain what you
mean by that maybe a good place to start

17570
05:56:37,590 --> 05:56:37,600
mean by that maybe a good place to start
 

17571
05:56:37,600 --> 05:56:40,468
mean by that maybe a good place to start
is to talk about web grid as a game as a

17572
05:56:40,468 --> 05:56:40,478
is to talk about web grid as a game as a
 

17573
05:56:40,478 --> 05:56:42,548
is to talk about web grid as a game as a
good illustration of the measurement of

17574
05:56:42,548 --> 05:56:42,558
good illustration of the measurement of
 

17575
05:56:42,558 --> 05:56:44,830
good illustration of the measurement of
performance yeah maybe I'll take one

17576
05:56:44,830 --> 05:56:44,840
performance yeah maybe I'll take one
 

17577
05:56:44,840 --> 05:56:46,510
performance yeah maybe I'll take one
zoom out step there which is just

17578
05:56:46,510 --> 05:56:46,520
zoom out step there which is just
 

17579
05:56:46,520 --> 05:56:48,830
zoom out step there which is just
explaining why uh we care to measure

17580
05:56:48,830 --> 05:56:48,840
explaining why uh we care to measure
 

17581
05:56:48,840 --> 05:56:50,110
explaining why uh we care to measure
this at all so again our goal is to

17582
05:56:50,110 --> 05:56:50,120
this at all so again our goal is to
 

17583
05:56:50,120 --> 05:56:52,110
this at all so again our goal is to
provide the user the ability to control

17584
05:56:52,110 --> 05:56:52,120
provide the user the ability to control
 

17585
05:56:52,120 --> 05:56:53,590
provide the user the ability to control
their computer as well as I can and

17586
05:56:53,590 --> 05:56:53,600
their computer as well as I can and
 

17587
05:56:53,600 --> 05:56:54,948
their computer as well as I can and
hopefully better and that means that

17588
05:56:54,948 --> 05:56:54,958
hopefully better and that means that
 

17589
05:56:54,958 --> 05:56:56,270
hopefully better and that means that
they can do it at the same speed as what

17590
05:56:56,270 --> 05:56:56,280
they can do it at the same speed as what
 

17591
05:56:56,280 --> 05:56:57,868
they can do it at the same speed as what
I can do it means that they have access

17592
05:56:57,868 --> 05:56:57,878
I can do it means that they have access
 

17593
05:56:57,878 --> 05:56:59,310
I can do it means that they have access
to all the same functionality that I

17594
05:56:59,310 --> 05:56:59,320
to all the same functionality that I
 

17595
05:56:59,320 --> 05:57:01,030
to all the same functionality that I
have including you know all those little

17596
05:57:01,030 --> 05:57:01,040
have including you know all those little
 

17597
05:57:01,040 --> 05:57:02,628
have including you know all those little
details like command tab command space

17598
05:57:02,628 --> 05:57:02,638
details like command tab command space
 

17599
05:57:02,638 --> 05:57:03,510
details like command tab command space
you know all this stuff they need to be

17600
05:57:03,510 --> 05:57:03,520
you know all this stuff they need to be
 

17601
05:57:03,520 --> 05:57:05,350
you know all this stuff they need to be
able to do it with their brain and with

17602
05:57:05,350 --> 05:57:05,360
able to do it with their brain and with
 

17603
05:57:05,360 --> 05:57:06,628
able to do it with their brain and with
the same level of reli AB ility is what

17604
05:57:06,628 --> 05:57:06,638
the same level of reli AB ility is what
 

17605
05:57:06,638 --> 05:57:08,030
the same level of reli AB ility is what
I can do with my muscles and that's a

17606
05:57:08,030 --> 05:57:08,040
I can do with my muscles and that's a
 

17607
05:57:08,040 --> 05:57:09,948
I can do with my muscles and that's a
high bar and so we intend to measure and

17608
05:57:09,948 --> 05:57:09,958
high bar and so we intend to measure and
 

17609
05:57:09,958 --> 05:57:11,390
high bar and so we intend to measure and
quantify every aspect of that to

17610
05:57:11,390 --> 05:57:11,400
quantify every aspect of that to
 

17611
05:57:11,400 --> 05:57:12,548
quantify every aspect of that to
understand how we're progressing towards

17612
05:57:12,548 --> 05:57:12,558
understand how we're progressing towards
 

17613
05:57:12,558 --> 05:57:13,948
understand how we're progressing towards
that goal there's many ways to measure

17614
05:57:13,948 --> 05:57:13,958
that goal there's many ways to measure
 

17615
05:57:13,958 --> 05:57:17,230
that goal there's many ways to measure
BPS by this isn't the only way but uh we

17616
05:57:17,230 --> 05:57:17,240
BPS by this isn't the only way but uh we
 

17617
05:57:17,240 --> 05:57:18,708
BPS by this isn't the only way but uh we
present the user a gr of targets and

17618
05:57:18,708 --> 05:57:18,718
present the user a gr of targets and
 

17619
05:57:18,718 --> 05:57:20,948
present the user a gr of targets and
basically we compute uh a score which is

17620
05:57:20,948 --> 05:57:20,958
basically we compute uh a score which is
 

17621
05:57:20,958 --> 05:57:22,708
basically we compute uh a score which is
dependent on how fast an accur they can

17622
05:57:22,708 --> 05:57:22,718
dependent on how fast an accur they can
 

17623
05:57:22,718 --> 05:57:23,990
dependent on how fast an accur they can
select and then how small are the

17624
05:57:23,990 --> 05:57:24,000
select and then how small are the
 

17625
05:57:24,000 --> 05:57:25,670
select and then how small are the
targets and the more targets that are on

17626
05:57:25,670 --> 05:57:25,680
targets and the more targets that are on
 

17627
05:57:25,680 --> 05:57:27,110
targets and the more targets that are on
the screen the smaller they are the more

17628
05:57:27,110 --> 05:57:27,120
the screen the smaller they are the more
 

17629
05:57:27,120 --> 05:57:29,350
the screen the smaller they are the more
information you you present per click

17630
05:57:29,350 --> 05:57:29,360
information you you present per click
 

17631
05:57:29,360 --> 05:57:30,788
information you you present per click
and so uh if you think about it from

17632
05:57:30,788 --> 05:57:30,798
and so uh if you think about it from
 

17633
05:57:30,798 --> 05:57:32,350
and so uh if you think about it from
information Theory point of view you can

17634
05:57:32,350 --> 05:57:32,360
information Theory point of view you can
 

17635
05:57:32,360 --> 05:57:33,788
information Theory point of view you can
communicate across different information

17636
05:57:33,788 --> 05:57:33,798
communicate across different information
 

17637
05:57:33,798 --> 05:57:36,548
communicate across different information
theoretic channels and one such channel

17638
05:57:36,548 --> 05:57:36,558
theoretic channels and one such channel
 

17639
05:57:36,558 --> 05:57:38,110
theoretic channels and one such channel
is a typing interface you could imagine

17640
05:57:38,110 --> 05:57:38,120
is a typing interface you could imagine
 

17641
05:57:38,120 --> 05:57:39,708
is a typing interface you could imagine
that's built out of a grid just like a

17642
05:57:39,708 --> 05:57:39,718
that's built out of a grid just like a
 

17643
05:57:39,718 --> 05:57:42,270
that's built out of a grid just like a
software keyboard on the screen and uh

17644
05:57:42,270 --> 05:57:42,280
software keyboard on the screen and uh
 

17645
05:57:42,280 --> 05:57:43,510
software keyboard on the screen and uh
bits per second is a measure that's

17646
05:57:43,510 --> 05:57:43,520
bits per second is a measure that's
 

17647
05:57:43,520 --> 05:57:45,430
bits per second is a measure that's
competed by taking the log of the number

17648
05:57:45,430 --> 05:57:45,440
competed by taking the log of the number
 

17649
05:57:45,440 --> 05:57:47,390
competed by taking the log of the number
of targets on the screen uh you can

17650
05:57:47,390 --> 05:57:47,400
of targets on the screen uh you can
 

17651
05:57:47,400 --> 05:57:48,910
of targets on the screen uh you can
subtract one if you care to model a

17652
05:57:48,910 --> 05:57:48,920
subtract one if you care to model a
 

17653
05:57:48,920 --> 05:57:50,110
subtract one if you care to model a
keyboard because you have to subtract

17654
05:57:50,110 --> 05:57:50,120
keyboard because you have to subtract
 

17655
05:57:50,120 --> 05:57:51,910
keyboard because you have to subtract
one for the delete key on the keyboard

17656
05:57:51,910 --> 05:57:51,920
one for the delete key on the keyboard
 

17657
05:57:51,920 --> 05:57:53,190
one for the delete key on the keyboard
but log of the number of targets on the

17658
05:57:53,190 --> 05:57:53,200
but log of the number of targets on the
 

17659
05:57:53,200 --> 05:57:55,190
but log of the number of targets on the
screen times the number of correct

17660
05:57:55,190 --> 05:57:55,200
screen times the number of correct
 

17661
05:57:55,200 --> 05:57:57,468

17665
05:57:59,840 --> 05:58:01,030
some time window for example 60 seconds
and that's sort of the standard way to

17666
05:58:01,030 --> 05:58:01,040
and that's sort of the standard way to
 

17667
05:58:01,040 --> 05:58:02,830
and that's sort of the standard way to
measure uh a cursor control task in

17668
05:58:02,830 --> 05:58:02,840
measure uh a cursor control task in

kind of bragging rights that we have now
 

17685
05:58:15,798 --> 05:58:17,030
kind of bragging rights that we have now
to say that noan is the best in the

world at this at this task with his PCI
 

17689
05:58:18,840 --> 05:58:19,948
world at this at this task with his PCI
it's very important for Progress that

17690
05:58:19,948 --> 05:58:19,958
it's very important for Progress that
 

17691
05:58:19,958 --> 05:58:21,590
it's very important for Progress that
you have standardized metrics so people

17692
05:58:21,590 --> 05:58:21,600
you have standardized metrics so people
 

17693
05:58:21,600 --> 05:58:23,270
you have standardized metrics so people
can compare across different techniques

17694
05:58:23,270 --> 05:58:23,280
can compare across different techniques
 

17695
05:58:23,280 --> 05:58:25,510
can compare across different techniques
and approaches how well does this do so

Noland and for me playing this task uh
 

17703
05:58:34,000 --> 05:58:35,150
Noland and for me playing this task uh
there's also different modes that you

17704
05:58:35,150 --> 05:58:35,160
there's also different modes that you
 

17705
05:58:35,160 --> 05:58:36,510
there's also different modes that you
can configure this task the web grid

17706
05:58:36,510 --> 05:58:36,520
can configure this task the web grid
 

17707
05:58:36,520 --> 05:58:38,150
can configure this task the web grid
task can be presented as just sort of a

05:58:38,150 --> 05:58:38,160
task can be presented as just sort of a
 

17709
05:58:38,160 --> 05:58:39,590
task can be presented as just sort of a
left click on the screen or you could

17710
05:58:39,590 --> 05:58:39,600
left click on the screen or you could
 

17711
05:58:39,600 --> 05:58:41,150
left click on the screen or you could
have you know targets that you just

17712
05:58:41,150 --> 05:58:41,160
have you know targets that you just
 

17713
05:58:41,160 --> 05:58:42,430
have you know targets that you just
dwell over or you could have targets

17714
05:58:42,430 --> 05:58:42,440
dwell over or you could have targets
 

17715
05:58:42,440 --> 05:58:43,750
dwell over or you could have targets
that you left right click on you could

17716
05:58:43,750 --> 05:58:43,760
that you left right click on you could
 

17717
05:58:43,760 --> 05:58:45,510
that you left right click on you could
have targets that are left right click

17718
05:58:45,510 --> 05:58:45,520
have targets that are left right click
 

17719
05:58:45,520 --> 05:58:46,830
have targets that are left right click
middle click scrolling clicking and

17720
05:58:46,830 --> 05:58:46,840
middle click scrolling clicking and
 

17721
05:58:46,840 --> 05:58:47,788
middle click scrolling clicking and
dragging you know you can do all sorts

17722
05:58:47,788 --> 05:58:47,798
dragging you know you can do all sorts
 

17723
05:58:47,798 --> 05:58:49,070
dragging you know you can do all sorts
of things within this this General

framework but the simplest purest form

17726
05:58:50,830 --> 05:58:50,840
framework but the simplest purest form
 

17727
05:58:50,840 --> 05:58:52,468
framework but the simplest purest form
is just blue targets show up on the

17728
05:58:52,468 --> 05:58:52,478
is just blue targets show up on the
 

17729
05:58:52,478 --> 05:58:54,390
is just blue targets show up on the
screen blue means left click that's the

05:58:54,390 --> 05:58:54,400
screen blue means left click that's the
 

17731
05:58:54,400 --> 05:58:57,468
screen blue means left click that's the
simplest form of the game and uh the

17732
05:58:57,468 --> 05:58:57,478
simplest form of the game and uh the
 

17733
05:58:57,478 --> 05:59:00,670
simplest form of the game and uh the
sort of Prior records here in uh

17734
05:59:00,670 --> 05:59:00,680
sort of Prior records here in uh
 

17735
05:59:00,680 --> 05:59:03,670
sort of Prior records here in uh
academic work and uh at Nur link

17736
05:59:03,670 --> 05:59:03,680

internally with sort of nhps uh have all

17738
05:59:06,708 --> 05:59:06,718
internally with sort of nhps uh have all
 

17739
05:59:06,718 --> 05:59:08,628
internally with sort of nhps uh have all
been matched or beaten by by Nolan with

17740
05:59:08,628 --> 05:59:08,638
been matched or beaten by by Nolan with
 

17741
05:59:08,638 --> 05:59:10,390
been matched or beaten by by Nolan with
his nurlink device so sort of prior to

17742
05:59:10,390 --> 05:59:10,400
his nurlink device so sort of prior to
 

17743
05:59:10,400 --> 05:59:13,110
his nurlink device so sort of prior to
nurlink the sort of world record for a

17744
05:59:13,110 --> 05:59:13,120
nurlink the sort of world record for a
 

17745
05:59:13,120 --> 05:59:15,350
nurlink the sort of world record for a
human using device is uh somewhere

17746
05:59:15,350 --> 05:59:15,360
human using device is uh somewhere
 

17747
05:59:15,360 --> 05:59:17,510
human using device is uh somewhere
between 4.2 to 4.6 BPS depending on

17748
05:59:17,510 --> 05:59:17,520
between 4.2 to 4.6 BPS depending on
 

17749
05:59:17,520 --> 05:59:18,750
between 4.2 to 4.6 BPS depending on
exactly what paper you read and how you

17750
05:59:18,750 --> 05:59:18,760
exactly what paper you read and how you
 

17751
05:59:18,760 --> 05:59:21,350
exactly what paper you read and how you
interpret it um Nolan's current record

17752
05:59:21,350 --> 05:59:21,360
interpret it um Nolan's current record
 

17753
05:59:21,360 --> 05:59:24,708
interpret it um Nolan's current record
is 8.5 BPS and again the sort of median

17754
05:59:24,708 --> 05:59:24,718
is 8.5 BPS and again the sort of median
 

17755
05:59:24,718 --> 05:59:26,350
is 8.5 BPS and again the sort of median
neural Linker performance is 10 BPS so

17756
05:59:26,350 --> 05:59:26,360
neural Linker performance is 10 BPS so
 

17757
05:59:26,360 --> 05:59:28,628
neural Linker performance is 10 BPS so
you can think of it roughly as he 85%

17758
05:59:28,628 --> 05:59:28,638
you can think of it roughly as he 85%
 

17759
05:59:28,638 --> 05:59:30,910
you can think of it roughly as he 85%
the level of control of a median neural

17760
05:59:30,910 --> 05:59:30,920
the level of control of a median neural
 

17761
05:59:30,920 --> 05:59:32,510
the level of control of a median neural

Targets on the screen and uh yeah I

17764
05:59:35,670 --> 05:59:35,680
Targets on the screen and uh yeah I
 

17765
05:59:35,680 --> 05:59:37,510
Targets on the screen and uh yeah I
think

17766
05:59:37,510 --> 05:59:37,520
think
 

17767
05:59:37,520 --> 05:59:39,910
think
there's a very interesting journey ahead

17768
05:59:39,910 --> 05:59:39,920
there's a very interesting journey ahead
 

17769
05:59:39,920 --> 05:59:41,830
there's a very interesting journey ahead
to get us to that same level of 10 BPS

17770
05:59:41,830 --> 05:59:41,840
to get us to that same level of 10 BPS
 

17771
05:59:41,840 --> 05:59:43,390
to get us to that same level of 10 BPS
performance it's not the case that sort

17772
05:59:43,390 --> 05:59:43,400
performance it's not the case that sort
 

17773
05:59:43,400 --> 05:59:45,070
performance it's not the case that sort
of the tricks that got us from you know

17774
05:59:45,070 --> 05:59:45,080

17775
05:59:45,080 --> 05:59:47,750
of the tricks that got us from you know
4 to 6 BPS and then 6 to 8 BPS are going

17776
05:59:47,750 --> 05:59:47,760
4 to 6 BPS and then 6 to 8 BPS are going
 

17777
05:59:47,760 --> 05:59:49,750
4 to 6 BPS and then 6 to 8 BPS are going
to be the ones that get us from 8 to 10

17778
05:59:49,750 --> 05:59:49,760
to be the ones that get us from 8 to 10
 

17779
05:59:49,760 --> 05:59:51,310
to be the ones that get us from 8 to 10
and uh in my view the core challenge

17780
05:59:51,310 --> 05:59:51,320
and uh in my view the core challenge
 

17781
05:59:51,320 --> 05:59:52,910
and uh in my view the core challenge
here is really the labeling problem it's

17782
05:59:52,910 --> 05:59:52,920
here is really the labeling problem it's
 

17783
05:59:52,920 --> 05:59:54,948
here is really the labeling problem it's
how do you understand at a very very

17784
05:59:54,948 --> 05:59:54,958
how do you understand at a very very
 

17785
05:59:54,958 --> 05:59:56,270
how do you understand at a very very
fine resolution what the user is

17786
05:59:56,270 --> 05:59:56,280
fine resolution what the user is
 

17787
05:59:56,280 --> 05:59:58,670
fine resolution what the user is
attempting to do and uh yeah I highly

17788
05:59:58,670 --> 05:59:58,680
attempting to do and uh yeah I highly
 

17789
05:59:58,680 --> 06:00:00,230
attempting to do and uh yeah I highly
encourage folks in Academia to uh to

17790
06:00:00,230 --> 06:00:00,240
encourage folks in Academia to uh to
 

17791
06:00:00,240 --> 06:00:02,708
encourage folks in Academia to uh to
work on this problem what's the journey

17792
06:00:02,708 --> 06:00:02,718
work on this problem what's the journey
 

17793
06:00:02,718 --> 06:00:05,390
work on this problem what's the journey
with Nolan on that quest of increasing

17794
06:00:05,390 --> 06:00:05,400
with Nolan on that quest of increasing
 

17795
06:00:05,400 --> 06:00:08,230
with Nolan on that quest of increasing
the BPS on web Grid in March you said

17796
06:00:08,230 --> 06:00:08,240
the BPS on web Grid in March you said
 

17797
06:00:08,240 --> 06:00:09,910
the BPS on web Grid in March you said
that he selected

17798
06:00:09,910 --> 06:00:09,920
that he selected
 

17799
06:00:09,920 --> 06:00:13,948
that he selected
89,4 185 Targets in web grid y so he

17800
06:00:13,948 --> 06:00:13,958
89,4 185 Targets in web grid y so he
 

17801
06:00:13,958 --> 06:00:15,948
89,4 185 Targets in web grid y so he
loves this game he's really serious

17802
06:00:15,948 --> 06:00:15,958
loves this game he's really serious
 

17803
06:00:15,958 --> 06:00:17,430
loves this game he's really serious
about improving his performance in this

17804
06:00:17,430 --> 06:00:17,440
about improving his performance in this
 

17805
06:00:17,440 --> 06:00:19,708
about improving his performance in this
game so what is that journey of trying

17806
06:00:19,708 --> 06:00:19,718
game so what is that journey of trying
 

17807
06:00:19,718 --> 06:00:21,110
game so what is that journey of trying
to figure out how to improve that

17808
06:00:21,110 --> 06:00:21,120
to figure out how to improve that
 

17809
06:00:21,120 --> 06:00:23,190
to figure out how to improve that
performance how much can that be done on

17810
06:00:23,190 --> 06:00:23,200
performance how much can that be done on
 

17811
06:00:23,200 --> 06:00:25,468
performance how much can that be done on
the decoding side how much can that be

17812
06:00:25,468 --> 06:00:25,478
the decoding side how much can that be
 

17813
06:00:25,478 --> 06:00:27,868
the decoding side how much can that be
done on the calibration side how much

17814
06:00:27,868 --> 06:00:27,878
done on the calibration side how much
 

17815
06:00:27,878 --> 06:00:30,750
done on the calibration side how much
can that be done on the Nolan side of

17816
06:00:30,750 --> 06:00:30,760
can that be done on the Nolan side of
 

17817
06:00:30,760 --> 06:00:32,708
can that be done on the Nolan side of
like figuring out how

17818
06:00:32,708 --> 06:00:32,718
like figuring out how
 

17819
06:00:32,718 --> 06:00:36,868
like figuring out how
to convey his intention more cleanly

17820
06:00:36,868 --> 06:00:36,878
to convey his intention more cleanly
 

17821
06:00:36,878 --> 06:00:38,868
to convey his intention more cleanly
yeah no this is a great question so in

17822
06:00:38,868 --> 06:00:38,878
yeah no this is a great question so in
 

17823
06:00:38,878 --> 06:00:41,230
yeah no this is a great question so in
my view one of the primary reasons why

17824
06:00:41,230 --> 06:00:41,240
my view one of the primary reasons why
 

17825
06:00:41,240 --> 06:00:42,468
my view one of the primary reasons why
Nolan's performance is so good is

17826
06:00:42,468 --> 06:00:42,478
Nolan's performance is so good is
 

17827
06:00:42,478 --> 06:00:45,350
Nolan's performance is so good is
because of Nolan Nolan is extremely

17828
06:00:45,350 --> 06:00:45,360
because of Nolan Nolan is extremely
 

17829
06:00:45,360 --> 06:00:47,750
because of Nolan Nolan is extremely
focused and very energetic he'll play

17830
06:00:47,750 --> 06:00:47,760
focused and very energetic he'll play
 

17831
06:00:47,760 --> 06:00:49,750
focused and very energetic he'll play
web grid sometimes for like four hours

17832
06:00:49,750 --> 06:00:49,760
web grid sometimes for like four hours
 

17833
06:00:49,760 --> 06:00:50,990
web grid sometimes for like four hours
in the middle of the night like from 2

17834
06:00:50,990 --> 06:00:51,000
in the middle of the night like from 2
 

17835
06:00:51,000 --> 06:00:53,030
in the middle of the night like from 2
a.m. to 6 a.m. he'll be playing web grid

17836
06:00:53,030 --> 06:00:53,040
a.m. to 6 a.m. he'll be playing web grid
 

17837
06:00:53,040 --> 06:00:54,510
a.m. to 6 a.m. he'll be playing web grid
just because he wants to push it to the

17838
06:00:54,510 --> 06:00:54,520
just because he wants to push it to the
 

17839
06:00:54,520 --> 06:00:56,708
just because he wants to push it to the
limits of what he can do and uh you know

17840
06:00:56,708 --> 06:00:56,718
limits of what he can do and uh you know
 

17841
06:00:56,718 --> 06:00:58,150
limits of what he can do and uh you know
this is not us like asking him to do

17842
06:00:58,150 --> 06:00:58,160
this is not us like asking him to do
 

17843
06:00:58,160 --> 06:00:59,670
this is not us like asking him to do
that I want to be clear like we're not

17844
06:00:59,670 --> 06:00:59,680
that I want to be clear like we're not
 

17845
06:00:59,680 --> 06:01:01,270
that I want to be clear like we're not
saying hey you should play webg tonight

17846
06:01:01,270 --> 06:01:01,280
saying hey you should play webg tonight
 

17847
06:01:01,280 --> 06:01:03,150
saying hey you should play webg tonight
we just gave him the game as part of our

17848
06:01:03,150 --> 06:01:03,160
we just gave him the game as part of our
 

17849
06:01:03,160 --> 06:01:05,270
we just gave him the game as part of our
research you know and he is able to play

17850
06:01:05,270 --> 06:01:05,280
research you know and he is able to play
 

17851
06:01:05,280 --> 06:01:07,070
research you know and he is able to play
independently and practice whenever he

17852
06:01:07,070 --> 06:01:07,080
independently and practice whenever he
 

17853
06:01:07,080 --> 06:01:08,910
independently and practice whenever he
wants and he really pushes hard to push

17854
06:01:08,910 --> 06:01:08,920
wants and he really pushes hard to push
 

17855
06:01:08,920 --> 06:01:11,070
wants and he really pushes hard to push
it the technology is the absolute limit

17856
06:01:11,070 --> 06:01:11,080
it the technology is the absolute limit
 

17857
06:01:11,080 --> 06:01:13,030
it the technology is the absolute limit
and he used it as like you know his job

17858
06:01:13,030 --> 06:01:13,040
and he used it as like you know his job
 

17859
06:01:13,040 --> 06:01:15,190
and he used it as like you know his job
really to make us be the bottleneck and

17860
06:01:15,190 --> 06:01:15,200
really to make us be the bottleneck and
 

17861
06:01:15,200 --> 06:01:17,708
really to make us be the bottleneck and
boy has he done that well uh and so that

17862
06:01:17,708 --> 06:01:17,718
boy has he done that well uh and so that
 

17863
06:01:17,718 --> 06:01:18,830
boy has he done that well uh and so that
the first thing to acknowledge is that

17864
06:01:18,830 --> 06:01:18,840
the first thing to acknowledge is that
 

17865
06:01:18,840 --> 06:01:20,310
the first thing to acknowledge is that
you know he was extremely motivated to

17866
06:01:20,310 --> 06:01:20,320
you know he was extremely motivated to
 

17867
06:01:20,320 --> 06:01:21,670
you know he was extremely motivated to
make this work I've also had the

17868
06:01:21,670 --> 06:01:21,680
make this work I've also had the
 

17869
06:01:21,680 --> 06:01:23,150
make this work I've also had the
privilege to meet other you know

17870
06:01:23,150 --> 06:01:23,160
privilege to meet other you know
 

17871
06:01:23,160 --> 06:01:24,868
privilege to meet other you know
clinical trial participants from brain

17872
06:01:24,868 --> 06:01:24,878
clinical trial participants from brain
 

17873
06:01:24,878 --> 06:01:26,468
clinical trial participants from brain
gain and other trials and they very much

17874
06:01:26,468 --> 06:01:26,478
gain and other trials and they very much
 

17875
06:01:26,478 --> 06:01:27,868
gain and other trials and they very much
share the same attitude of like they

17876
06:01:27,868 --> 06:01:27,878
share the same attitude of like they
 

17877
06:01:27,878 --> 06:01:29,750
share the same attitude of like they
they they view this as their life's work

17878
06:01:29,750 --> 06:01:29,760
they they view this as their life's work
 

17879
06:01:29,760 --> 06:01:32,030
they they view this as their life's work
to uh you know Advance the technology as

17880
06:01:32,030 --> 06:01:32,040
to uh you know Advance the technology as
 

17881
06:01:32,040 --> 06:01:34,110
to uh you know Advance the technology as
much as they can and uh if that means

17882
06:01:34,110 --> 06:01:34,120
much as they can and uh if that means
 

17883
06:01:34,120 --> 06:01:35,910
much as they can and uh if that means
fting Targets on the screen for 4 hours

17884
06:01:35,910 --> 06:01:35,920
fting Targets on the screen for 4 hours
 

17885
06:01:35,920 --> 06:01:38,468
fting Targets on the screen for 4 hours
2 a.m. to 6: a.m. then so be it and uh

17886
06:01:38,468 --> 06:01:38,478
2 a.m. to 6: a.m. then so be it and uh
 

17887
06:01:38,478 --> 06:01:39,788
2 a.m. to 6: a.m. then so be it and uh
there's something extremely admirable

17888
06:01:39,788 --> 06:01:39,798
there's something extremely admirable
 

17889
06:01:39,798 --> 06:01:42,430
there's something extremely admirable
about that that's worth uh calling out

17890
06:01:42,430 --> 06:01:42,440
about that that's worth uh calling out
 

17891
06:01:42,440 --> 06:01:43,868
about that that's worth uh calling out
okay so now how do you how do you sort

17892
06:01:43,868 --> 06:01:43,878
okay so now how do you how do you sort
 

17893
06:01:43,878 --> 06:01:45,990
okay so now how do you how do you sort
of get from where he started which is no

17894
06:01:45,990 --> 06:01:46,000
of get from where he started which is no
 

17895
06:01:46,000 --> 06:01:48,510
of get from where he started which is no
cursor control at PPS so I mean when he

17896
06:01:48,510 --> 06:01:48,520
cursor control at PPS so I mean when he
 

17897
06:01:48,520 --> 06:01:50,230
cursor control at PPS so I mean when he
started there's a huge amount of

17898
06:01:50,230 --> 06:01:50,240
started there's a huge amount of
 

17899
06:01:50,240 --> 06:01:52,150
started there's a huge amount of
learning to do on his side and our side

17900
06:01:52,150 --> 06:01:52,160
learning to do on his side and our side
 

17901
06:01:52,160 --> 06:01:54,190
learning to do on his side and our side
to figure out uh what's the most

17902
06:01:54,190 --> 06:01:54,200
to figure out uh what's the most
 

17903
06:01:54,200 --> 06:01:56,430
to figure out uh what's the most
intuitive control for him and the most

17904
06:01:56,430 --> 06:01:56,440
intuitive control for him and the most
 

17905
06:01:56,440 --> 06:01:58,788
intuitive control for him and the most
intuitive control for him is uh sort of

17906
06:01:58,788 --> 06:01:58,798
intuitive control for him is uh sort of
 

17907
06:01:58,798 --> 06:02:00,628
intuitive control for him is uh sort of
you have to find the set intersection of

17908
06:02:00,628 --> 06:02:00,638
you have to find the set intersection of
 

17909
06:02:00,638 --> 06:02:02,708
you have to find the set intersection of
what do we have the signal to decode so

17910
06:02:02,708 --> 06:02:02,718
what do we have the signal to decode so
 

17911
06:02:02,718 --> 06:02:04,030
what do we have the signal to decode so
we don't pick up you know every single

17912
06:02:04,030 --> 06:02:04,040
we don't pick up you know every single
 

17913
06:02:04,040 --> 06:02:05,230
we don't pick up you know every single
neuron in the motor cortex which means

17914
06:02:05,230 --> 06:02:05,240
neuron in the motor cortex which means
 

17915
06:02:05,240 --> 06:02:06,628
neuron in the motor cortex which means
we don't have repres for every part of

17916
06:02:06,628 --> 06:02:06,638
we don't have repres for every part of
 

17917
06:02:06,638 --> 06:02:08,468
we don't have repres for every part of
the body so there may be some SS that we

17918
06:02:08,468 --> 06:02:08,478
the body so there may be some SS that we
 

17919
06:02:08,478 --> 06:02:10,548
the body so there may be some SS that we
have better sort of decode performance

17920
06:02:10,548 --> 06:02:10,558
have better sort of decode performance
 

17921
06:02:10,558 --> 06:02:12,708
have better sort of decode performance
on than others for example on his left

17922
06:02:12,708 --> 06:02:12,718
on than others for example on his left
 

17923
06:02:12,718 --> 06:02:13,948
on than others for example on his left
hand we have a lot of difficulty

17924
06:02:13,948 --> 06:02:13,958
hand we have a lot of difficulty
 

17925
06:02:13,958 --> 06:02:16,150
hand we have a lot of difficulty
distinguishing his left ring finger from

17926
06:02:16,150 --> 06:02:16,160
distinguishing his left ring finger from
 

17927
06:02:16,160 --> 06:02:18,510
distinguishing his left ring finger from
his left middle finger but on his right

17928
06:02:18,510 --> 06:02:18,520
his left middle finger but on his right
 

17929
06:02:18,520 --> 06:02:19,990
his left middle finger but on his right
hand we have a good you know good

17930
06:02:19,990 --> 06:02:20,000
hand we have a good you know good
 

17931
06:02:20,000 --> 06:02:21,510
hand we have a good you know good
control and good modulation detected

17932
06:02:21,510 --> 06:02:21,520
control and good modulation detected
 

17933
06:02:21,520 --> 06:02:22,868
control and good modulation detected
from the neurons were able to record for

17934
06:02:22,868 --> 06:02:22,878
from the neurons were able to record for
 

17935
06:02:22,878 --> 06:02:24,430
from the neurons were able to record for
his pinky and his thumb and his index

17936
06:02:24,430 --> 06:02:24,440
his pinky and his thumb and his index
 

17937
06:02:24,440 --> 06:02:26,548
his pinky and his thumb and his index
finger so you can imagine how these

17938
06:02:26,548 --> 06:02:26,558
finger so you can imagine how these
 

17939
06:02:26,558 --> 06:02:28,910
finger so you can imagine how these
different uh you know subspaces of

17940
06:02:28,910 --> 06:02:28,920
different uh you know subspaces of
 

17941
06:02:28,920 --> 06:02:30,868
different uh you know subspaces of
modulated activity intersect with what's

17942
06:02:30,868 --> 06:02:30,878
modulated activity intersect with what's
 

17943
06:02:30,878 --> 06:02:32,510
modulated activity intersect with what's
the most intuitive for him and this has

17944
06:02:32,510 --> 06:02:32,520
the most intuitive for him and this has
 

17945
06:02:32,520 --> 06:02:34,150
the most intuitive for him and this has
evolved over time so once we gave him

17946
06:02:34,150 --> 06:02:34,160
evolved over time so once we gave him
 

17947
06:02:34,160 --> 06:02:35,628
evolved over time so once we gave him
the ability to calibrate models on his

17948
06:02:35,628 --> 06:02:35,638
the ability to calibrate models on his
 

17949
06:02:35,638 --> 06:02:37,750
the ability to calibrate models on his
own he was able to go and explore

17950
06:02:37,750 --> 06:02:37,760
own he was able to go and explore
 

17951
06:02:37,760 --> 06:02:39,150
own he was able to go and explore
various different ways to imagine

17952
06:02:39,150 --> 06:02:39,160
various different ways to imagine
 

17953
06:02:39,160 --> 06:02:40,708
various different ways to imagine
controlling the cursor for example he

17954
06:02:40,708 --> 06:02:40,718
controlling the cursor for example he
 

17955
06:02:40,718 --> 06:02:42,070
controlling the cursor for example he
could imagine controlling the cursor by

17956
06:02:42,070 --> 06:02:42,080
could imagine controlling the cursor by
 

17957
06:02:42,080 --> 06:02:43,788
could imagine controlling the cursor by
wiggling his wrist side to side or by

17958
06:02:43,788 --> 06:02:43,798
wiggling his wrist side to side or by
 

17959
06:02:43,798 --> 06:02:45,270
wiggling his wrist side to side or by
moving his entire arm but I think at one

17960
06:02:45,270 --> 06:02:45,280
moving his entire arm but I think at one
 

17961
06:02:45,280 --> 06:02:46,548
moving his entire arm but I think at one
point he did his feet you know he tried

17962
06:02:46,548 --> 06:02:46,558
point he did his feet you know he tried
 

17963
06:02:46,558 --> 06:02:48,230
point he did his feet you know he tried
like whole bunch of stuff to explore the

17964
06:02:48,230 --> 06:02:48,240
like whole bunch of stuff to explore the
 

17965
06:02:48,240 --> 06:02:50,310
like whole bunch of stuff to explore the
space of what is the most natural way

17966
06:02:50,310 --> 06:02:50,320
space of what is the most natural way
 

17967
06:02:50,320 --> 06:02:52,430
space of what is the most natural way
for him to control the cursor that at

17968
06:02:52,430 --> 06:02:52,440
for him to control the cursor that at
 

17969
06:02:52,440 --> 06:02:53,948
for him to control the cursor that at
the same time is easy for us to decode

17970
06:02:53,948 --> 06:02:53,958
the same time is easy for us to decode
 

17971
06:02:53,958 --> 06:02:56,708
the same time is easy for us to decode
real just to clarify it's through the

17972
06:02:56,708 --> 06:02:56,718
real just to clarify it's through the
 

17973
06:02:56,718 --> 06:02:58,990
real just to clarify it's through the
body mapping procedure that you're able

17974
06:02:58,990 --> 06:02:59,000
body mapping procedure that you're able
 

17975
06:02:59,000 --> 06:03:02,548
body mapping procedure that you're able
to figure out which finger he can move

17976
06:03:02,548 --> 06:03:02,558
to figure out which finger he can move
 

17977
06:03:02,558 --> 06:03:04,468
to figure out which finger he can move
uh yes yes that's one way to do it um

17978
06:03:04,468 --> 06:03:04,478
uh yes yes that's one way to do it um
 

17979
06:03:04,478 --> 06:03:07,468
uh yes yes that's one way to do it um
maybe one Nuance of the when he's doing

17980
06:03:07,468 --> 06:03:07,478
maybe one Nuance of the when he's doing
 

17981
06:03:07,478 --> 06:03:09,628
maybe one Nuance of the when he's doing
it he can imagine many more things than

17982
06:03:09,628 --> 06:03:09,638
it he can imagine many more things than
 

17983
06:03:09,638 --> 06:03:11,030
it he can imagine many more things than
we represent in that visual on the

17984
06:03:11,030 --> 06:03:11,040
we represent in that visual on the
 

17985
06:03:11,040 --> 06:03:12,990
we represent in that visual on the
screen so we show him sort of abstractly

17986
06:03:12,990 --> 06:03:13,000
screen so we show him sort of abstractly
 

17987
06:03:13,000 --> 06:03:15,510
screen so we show him sort of abstractly
here's a cursor you figure out what

17988
06:03:15,510 --> 06:03:15,520
here's a cursor you figure out what
 

17989
06:03:15,520 --> 06:03:18,030
here's a cursor you figure out what
works the best for you and we obviously

17990
06:03:18,030 --> 06:03:18,040
works the best for you and we obviously
 

17991
06:03:18,040 --> 06:03:19,190
works the best for you and we obviously
have hints about what will work best

17992
06:03:19,190 --> 06:03:19,200
have hints about what will work best
 

17993
06:03:19,200 --> 06:03:20,590
have hints about what will work best
from that body mapping procedure of you

17994
06:03:20,590 --> 06:03:20,600
from that body mapping procedure of you
 

17995
06:03:20,600 --> 06:03:22,548
from that body mapping procedure of you
know we know that this particular action

17996
06:03:22,548 --> 06:03:22,558
know we know that this particular action
 

17997
06:03:22,558 --> 06:03:24,190
know we know that this particular action
we can represent well but it's really up

17998
06:03:24,190 --> 06:03:24,200
we can represent well but it's really up
 

17999
06:03:24,200 --> 06:03:25,430
we can represent well but it's really up
to him to go and explore and figure out

18000
06:03:25,430 --> 06:03:25,440
to him to go and explore and figure out
 

18001
06:03:25,440 --> 06:03:28,030
to him to go and explore and figure out
what works the best but at which point

18002
06:03:28,030 --> 06:03:28,040
what works the best but at which point
 

18003
06:03:28,040 --> 06:03:30,830
what works the best but at which point
does he no longer visualize the movement

18004
06:03:30,830 --> 06:03:30,840
does he no longer visualize the movement
 

18005
06:03:30,840 --> 06:03:32,430
does he no longer visualize the movement
of his body and he's just visualizing

18006
06:03:32,430 --> 06:03:32,440
of his body and he's just visualizing
 

18007
06:03:32,440 --> 06:03:34,190
of his body and he's just visualizing
the movement of the cursor yeah how

18008
06:03:34,190 --> 06:03:34,200
the movement of the cursor yeah how
 

18009
06:03:34,200 --> 06:03:36,468
the movement of the cursor yeah how
quickly does he go from how quickly does

18010
06:03:36,468 --> 06:03:36,478
quickly does he go from how quickly does
 

18011
06:03:36,478 --> 06:03:38,230
quickly does he go from how quickly does
it get there so this happened on a

18012
06:03:38,230 --> 06:03:38,240
it get there so this happened on a
 

18013
06:03:38,240 --> 06:03:40,350
it get there so this happened on a
Tuesday I remember this day very clearly

18014
06:03:40,350 --> 06:03:40,360
Tuesday I remember this day very clearly
 

18015
06:03:40,360 --> 06:03:42,030
Tuesday I remember this day very clearly
because at some point during the during

18016
06:03:42,030 --> 06:03:42,040
because at some point during the during
 

18017
06:03:42,040 --> 06:03:44,390
because at some point during the during
the day uh it looked like he wasn't

18018
06:03:44,390 --> 06:03:44,400
the day uh it looked like he wasn't
 

18019
06:03:44,400 --> 06:03:45,548
the day uh it looked like he wasn't
doing super well like it looked like the

18020
06:03:45,548 --> 06:03:45,558
doing super well like it looked like the
 

18021
06:03:45,558 --> 06:03:46,990
doing super well like it looked like the
model wasn't performing super well and

18022
06:03:46,990 --> 06:03:47,000
model wasn't performing super well and
 

18023
06:03:47,000 --> 06:03:48,830
model wasn't performing super well and
he was like getting distracted but he

18024
06:03:48,830 --> 06:03:48,840
he was like getting distracted but he
 

18025
06:03:48,840 --> 06:03:49,990
he was like getting distracted but he
actually it wasn't the case like what

18026
06:03:49,990 --> 06:03:50,000
actually it wasn't the case like what
 

18027
06:03:50,000 --> 06:03:52,070
actually it wasn't the case like what
actually happened was he was trying

18028
06:03:52,070 --> 06:03:52,080
actually happened was he was trying
 

18029
06:03:52,080 --> 06:03:54,350
actually happened was he was trying
something new where he was just

18030
06:03:54,350 --> 06:03:54,360
something new where he was just
 

18031
06:03:54,360 --> 06:03:56,350
something new where he was just
controlling the cursor so he wasn't

18032
06:03:56,350 --> 06:03:56,360
controlling the cursor so he wasn't
 

18033
06:03:56,360 --> 06:03:58,150
controlling the cursor so he wasn't
imagining moving his hand anymore he was

18034
06:03:58,150 --> 06:03:58,160
imagining moving his hand anymore he was
 

18035
06:03:58,160 --> 06:03:59,868
imagining moving his hand anymore he was
just imagining I don't know what it is

18036
06:03:59,868 --> 06:03:59,878
just imagining I don't know what it is
 

18037
06:03:59,878 --> 06:04:01,310
just imagining I don't know what it is
some like abstract intention to move the

18038
06:04:01,310 --> 06:04:01,320
some like abstract intention to move the
 

18039
06:04:01,320 --> 06:04:03,948
some like abstract intention to move the
cursor on the screen and uh I cannot

18040
06:04:03,948 --> 06:04:03,958
cursor on the screen and uh I cannot
 

18041
06:04:03,958 --> 06:04:04,830
cursor on the screen and uh I cannot
tell you what the difference between

18042
06:04:04,830 --> 06:04:04,840
tell you what the difference between
 

18043
06:04:04,840 --> 06:04:06,948
tell you what the difference between
those two things are I truly cannot he's

18044
06:04:06,948 --> 06:04:06,958
those two things are I truly cannot he's
 

18045
06:04:06,958 --> 06:04:08,310
those two things are I truly cannot he's
tried to explain it to me before I

18046
06:04:08,310 --> 06:04:08,320
tried to explain it to me before I
 

18047
06:04:08,320 --> 06:04:10,708
tried to explain it to me before I
cannot uh you know give a first- person

18048
06:04:10,708 --> 06:04:10,718
cannot uh you know give a first- person
 

18049
06:04:10,718 --> 06:04:12,548
cannot uh you know give a first- person
account of what that's like but the

18050
06:04:12,548 --> 06:04:12,558
account of what that's like but the
 

18051
06:04:12,558 --> 06:04:13,788
account of what that's like but the
expletives that he uttered in that

18052
06:04:13,788 --> 06:04:13,798
expletives that he uttered in that
 

18053
06:04:13,798 --> 06:04:15,990
expletives that he uttered in that
moment where uh you know enough to

18054
06:04:15,990 --> 06:04:16,000
moment where uh you know enough to
 

18055
06:04:16,000 --> 06:04:17,510
moment where uh you know enough to
suggest that it was a very qualitatively

18056
06:04:17,510 --> 06:04:17,520
suggest that it was a very qualitatively
 

18057
06:04:17,520 --> 06:04:19,830
suggest that it was a very qualitatively
different experience for him to just

18058
06:04:19,830 --> 06:04:19,840
different experience for him to just
 

18059
06:04:19,840 --> 06:04:22,628
different experience for him to just
have direct neural control over a

18060
06:04:22,628 --> 06:04:22,638
have direct neural control over a
 

18061
06:04:22,638 --> 06:04:26,750
have direct neural control over a
cursor I wonder if there's a way through

18062
06:04:26,750 --> 06:04:26,760
cursor I wonder if there's a way through
 

18063
06:04:26,760 --> 06:04:29,510
cursor I wonder if there's a way through
ux to encourage a human being to

18064
06:04:29,510 --> 06:04:29,520
ux to encourage a human being to
 

18065
06:04:29,520 --> 06:04:32,270
ux to encourage a human being to
discover that because he discovered it

18066
06:04:32,270 --> 06:04:32,280
discover that because he discovered it
 

18067
06:04:32,280 --> 06:04:34,310
discover that because he discovered it
like you said uh to me that he's a

18068
06:04:34,310 --> 06:04:34,320
like you said uh to me that he's a
 

18069
06:04:34,320 --> 06:04:37,310
like you said uh to me that he's a
Pioneer so he discovered that on his own

18070
06:04:37,310 --> 06:04:37,320
Pioneer so he discovered that on his own
 

18071
06:04:37,320 --> 06:04:39,788
Pioneer so he discovered that on his own
through all this uh the process of

18072
06:04:39,788 --> 06:04:39,798
through all this uh the process of
 

18073
06:04:39,798 --> 06:04:42,190
through all this uh the process of
trying to trying to move the cursor with

18074
06:04:42,190 --> 06:04:42,200
trying to trying to move the cursor with
 

18075
06:04:42,200 --> 06:04:43,270
trying to trying to move the cursor with
different kinds of

18076
06:04:43,270 --> 06:04:43,280
different kinds of
 

18077
06:04:43,280 --> 06:04:45,868
different kinds of
intentions but that is clearly a really

18078
06:04:45,868 --> 06:04:45,878
intentions but that is clearly a really
 

18079
06:04:45,878 --> 06:04:49,150
intentions but that is clearly a really
powerful thing to arrive at which is to

18080
06:04:49,150 --> 06:04:49,160
powerful thing to arrive at which is to
 

18081
06:04:49,160 --> 06:04:52,548
powerful thing to arrive at which is to
let go of trying to control the fingers

18082
06:04:52,548 --> 06:04:52,558
let go of trying to control the fingers
 

18083
06:04:52,558 --> 06:04:54,868
let go of trying to control the fingers
and the hand and control the actual

18084
06:04:54,868 --> 06:04:54,878
and the hand and control the actual
 

18085
06:04:54,878 --> 06:04:56,430
and the hand and control the actual
digital device with your mind that's

18086
06:04:56,430 --> 06:04:56,440
digital device with your mind that's
 

18087
06:04:56,440 --> 06:04:58,510
digital device with your mind that's
right ux is how it works and the ideal

18088
06:04:58,510 --> 06:04:58,520
right ux is how it works and the ideal
 

18089
06:04:58,520 --> 06:05:00,830
right ux is how it works and the ideal
ux is one that it's the user doesn't

18090
06:05:00,830 --> 06:05:00,840
ux is one that it's the user doesn't
 

18091
06:05:00,840 --> 06:05:02,628
ux is one that it's the user doesn't
have to think about what they need to do

18092
06:05:02,628 --> 06:05:02,638
have to think about what they need to do
 

18093
06:05:02,638 --> 06:05:04,788
have to think about what they need to do
in order to get it done they just it

18094
06:05:04,788 --> 06:05:04,798
in order to get it done they just it
 

18095
06:05:04,798 --> 06:05:06,990
in order to get it done they just it
just does it

18096
06:05:06,990 --> 06:05:07,000
just does it
 

18097
06:05:07,000 --> 06:05:08,628
just does it
that is so fascinating but I wonder on

18098
06:05:08,628 --> 06:05:08,638
that is so fascinating but I wonder on
 

18099
06:05:08,638 --> 06:05:11,750
that is so fascinating but I wonder on
the on the biological side how long it

18100
06:05:11,750 --> 06:05:11,760
the on the biological side how long it
 

18101
06:05:11,760 --> 06:05:13,868
the on the biological side how long it
takes for the brain to adapt yeah so is

18102
06:05:13,868 --> 06:05:13,878
takes for the brain to adapt yeah so is
 

18103
06:05:13,878 --> 06:05:16,590
takes for the brain to adapt yeah so is
it just simply

18104
06:05:16,590 --> 06:05:16,600
it just simply
 

18105
06:05:16,600 --> 06:05:19,590
it just simply
learning like highle software or is

18106
06:05:19,590 --> 06:05:19,600
learning like highle software or is
 

18107
06:05:19,600 --> 06:05:21,430
learning like highle software or is
there like a neuroplasticity component

18108
06:05:21,430 --> 06:05:21,440
there like a neuroplasticity component
 

18109
06:05:21,440 --> 06:05:24,110
there like a neuroplasticity component
where like the the brain is adjusting

18110
06:05:24,110 --> 06:05:24,120
where like the the brain is adjusting
 

18111
06:05:24,120 --> 06:05:26,990
where like the the brain is adjusting
slowly yeah I the truth is I don't know

18112
06:05:26,990 --> 06:05:27,000
slowly yeah I the truth is I don't know
 

18113
06:05:27,000 --> 06:05:29,230
slowly yeah I the truth is I don't know
um I'm very excited to see with sort of

18114
06:05:29,230 --> 06:05:29,240
um I'm very excited to see with sort of
 

18115
06:05:29,240 --> 06:05:31,070
um I'm very excited to see with sort of
the second participant that we implant

18116
06:05:31,070 --> 06:05:31,080
the second participant that we implant
 

18117
06:05:31,080 --> 06:05:33,430
the second participant that we implant
what the you know what the journey is

18118
06:05:33,430 --> 06:05:33,440
what the you know what the journey is
 

18119
06:05:33,440 --> 06:05:34,948
what the you know what the journey is
like for them because we'll have learned

18120
06:05:34,948 --> 06:05:34,958
like for them because we'll have learned
 

18121
06:05:34,958 --> 06:05:36,830
like for them because we'll have learned
a lot more potentially we can help them

18122
06:05:36,830 --> 06:05:36,840
a lot more potentially we can help them
 

18123
06:05:36,840 --> 06:05:37,990
a lot more potentially we can help them
understand and explore that direction

18124
06:05:37,990 --> 06:05:38,000
understand and explore that direction
 

18125
06:05:38,000 --> 06:05:39,430
understand and explore that direction
more quickly this is something I didn't

18126
06:05:39,430 --> 06:05:39,440
more quickly this is something I didn't
 

18127
06:05:39,440 --> 06:05:41,708
more quickly this is something I didn't
you know this wasn't me prompting Nolan

18128
06:05:41,708 --> 06:05:41,718
you know this wasn't me prompting Nolan
 

18129
06:05:41,718 --> 06:05:43,350
you know this wasn't me prompting Nolan
to go try this he was just exploring how

18130
06:05:43,350 --> 06:05:43,360
to go try this he was just exploring how
 

18131
06:05:43,360 --> 06:05:45,510
to go try this he was just exploring how
to use his device and figured it out

18132
06:05:45,510 --> 06:05:45,520
to use his device and figured it out
 

18133
06:05:45,520 --> 06:05:47,350
to use his device and figured it out
himself but now that we know that that's

18134
06:05:47,350 --> 06:05:47,360
himself but now that we know that that's
 

18135
06:05:47,360 --> 06:05:48,708
himself but now that we know that that's
a possibility that maybe there's a way

18136
06:05:48,708 --> 06:05:48,718
a possibility that maybe there's a way
 

18137
06:05:48,718 --> 06:05:50,548
a possibility that maybe there's a way
to you know for example hint the user

18138
06:05:50,548 --> 06:05:50,558
to you know for example hint the user
 

18139
06:05:50,558 --> 06:05:52,230
to you know for example hint the user
don't try super hard during calibration

18140
06:05:52,230 --> 06:05:52,240
don't try super hard during calibration
 

18141
06:05:52,240 --> 06:05:53,990
don't try super hard during calibration
just do something that feels natural or

18142
06:05:53,990 --> 06:05:54,000
just do something that feels natural or
 

18143
06:05:54,000 --> 06:05:55,468
just do something that feels natural or
just directly control the cursor you

18144
06:05:55,468 --> 06:05:55,478
just directly control the cursor you
 

18145
06:05:55,478 --> 06:05:57,510
just directly control the cursor you
know don't imagine explicit action and

18146
06:05:57,510 --> 06:05:57,520
know don't imagine explicit action and
 

18147
06:05:57,520 --> 06:05:58,750
know don't imagine explicit action and
from there we should be able to

18148
06:05:58,750 --> 06:05:58,760
from there we should be able to
 

18149
06:05:58,760 --> 06:06:00,310
from there we should be able to
hopefully understand how this is for

18150
06:06:00,310 --> 06:06:00,320
hopefully understand how this is for
 

18151
06:06:00,320 --> 06:06:02,110
hopefully understand how this is for
somebody who has not experienced that

18152
06:06:02,110 --> 06:06:02,120
somebody who has not experienced that
 

18153
06:06:02,120 --> 06:06:03,510
somebody who has not experienced that
before maybe that's the default mode of

18154
06:06:03,510 --> 06:06:03,520
before maybe that's the default mode of
 

18155
06:06:03,520 --> 06:06:04,670
before maybe that's the default mode of
operation for them you don't have to go

18156
06:06:04,670 --> 06:06:04,680
operation for them you don't have to go
 

18157
06:06:04,680 --> 06:06:06,310
operation for them you don't have to go
through this into mediate phase of

18158
06:06:06,310 --> 06:06:06,320
through this into mediate phase of
 

18159
06:06:06,320 --> 06:06:08,788
through this into mediate phase of
explicit emotions or maybe if that

18160
06:06:08,788 --> 06:06:08,798
explicit emotions or maybe if that
 

18161
06:06:08,798 --> 06:06:10,390
explicit emotions or maybe if that
naturally happens for people you can

18162
06:06:10,390 --> 06:06:10,400
naturally happens for people you can
 

18163
06:06:10,400 --> 06:06:12,868
naturally happens for people you can
just occasionally encourage them to

18164
06:06:12,868 --> 06:06:12,878
just occasionally encourage them to
 

18165
06:06:12,878 --> 06:06:14,468
just occasionally encourage them to
allow themselves to move the cursor

18166
06:06:14,468 --> 06:06:14,478
allow themselves to move the cursor
 

18167
06:06:14,478 --> 06:06:15,708
allow themselves to move the cursor
right actually sometimes just like with

18168
06:06:15,708 --> 06:06:15,718
right actually sometimes just like with
 

18169
06:06:15,718 --> 06:06:18,270
right actually sometimes just like with
a form in a mile just the knowledge that

18170
06:06:18,270 --> 06:06:18,280
a form in a mile just the knowledge that
 

18171
06:06:18,280 --> 06:06:21,270
a form in a mile just the knowledge that
that's possible pushes you to do it yeah

18172
06:06:21,270 --> 06:06:21,280
that's possible pushes you to do it yeah
 

18173
06:06:21,280 --> 06:06:22,910
that's possible pushes you to do it yeah
enables you to do it and then it becomes

18174
06:06:22,910 --> 06:06:22,920
enables you to do it and then it becomes
 

18175
06:06:22,920 --> 06:06:24,868
enables you to do it and then it becomes
trivial and then it also makes you

18176
06:06:24,868 --> 06:06:24,878
trivial and then it also makes you
 

18177
06:06:24,878 --> 06:06:26,830
trivial and then it also makes you
wonder this is the cool thing about

18178
06:06:26,830 --> 06:06:26,840
wonder this is the cool thing about
 

18179
06:06:26,840 --> 06:06:29,948
wonder this is the cool thing about
humans if once there's a lot more human

18180
06:06:29,948 --> 06:06:29,958
humans if once there's a lot more human
 

18181
06:06:29,958 --> 06:06:31,948
humans if once there's a lot more human
participants they will discover things

18182
06:06:31,948 --> 06:06:31,958
participants they will discover things
 

18183
06:06:31,958 --> 06:06:34,230
participants they will discover things
that are possible yes and share their

18184
06:06:34,230 --> 06:06:34,240
that are possible yes and share their
 

18185
06:06:34,240 --> 06:06:36,270
that are possible yes and share their
experiences each other and that because

18186
06:06:36,270 --> 06:06:36,280
experiences each other and that because
 

18187
06:06:36,280 --> 06:06:38,948
experiences each other and that because
of them sharing it they'll be able to do

18188
06:06:38,948 --> 06:06:38,958
of them sharing it they'll be able to do
 

18189
06:06:38,958 --> 06:06:41,350
of them sharing it they'll be able to do
it m uh all of a sudden that's that's

18190
06:06:41,350 --> 06:06:41,360
it m uh all of a sudden that's that's
 

18191
06:06:41,360 --> 06:06:43,590
it m uh all of a sudden that's that's
unlocked for everybody y because just

18192
06:06:43,590 --> 06:06:43,600
unlocked for everybody y because just
 

18193
06:06:43,600 --> 06:06:45,110
unlocked for everybody y because just
the knowledge sometimes is the thing

18194
06:06:45,110 --> 06:06:45,120
the knowledge sometimes is the thing
 

18195
06:06:45,120 --> 06:06:47,590
the knowledge sometimes is the thing
that enables it to do it yeah I me just

18196
06:06:47,590 --> 06:06:47,600
that enables it to do it yeah I me just
 

18197
06:06:47,600 --> 06:06:49,548
that enables it to do it yeah I me just
coming on that too like there's we've

18198
06:06:49,548 --> 06:06:49,558
coming on that too like there's we've
 

18199
06:06:49,558 --> 06:06:50,868
coming on that too like there's we've
probably tried like a thousand different

18200
06:06:50,868 --> 06:06:50,878
probably tried like a thousand different
 

18201
06:06:50,878 --> 06:06:53,270
probably tried like a thousand different
ways to do various uh aspects of

18202
06:06:53,270 --> 06:06:53,280
ways to do various uh aspects of
 

18203
06:06:53,280 --> 06:06:55,030
ways to do various uh aspects of
decoding and now we know like what the

18204
06:06:55,030 --> 06:06:55,040
decoding and now we know like what the
 

18205
06:06:55,040 --> 06:06:56,468
decoding and now we know like what the
right Subspace is to continue exploring

18206
06:06:56,468 --> 06:06:56,478
right Subspace is to continue exploring
 

18207
06:06:56,478 --> 06:06:57,990
right Subspace is to continue exploring
further again thanks to Nolan and the

18208
06:06:57,990 --> 06:06:58,000
further again thanks to Nolan and the
 

18209
06:06:58,000 --> 06:07:00,110
further again thanks to Nolan and the
many hours he's put into this and so

18210
06:07:00,110 --> 06:07:00,120
many hours he's put into this and so
 

18211
06:07:00,120 --> 06:07:01,910
many hours he's put into this and so
even just that help like help constraint

18212
06:07:01,910 --> 06:07:01,920
even just that help like help constraint
 

18213
06:07:01,920 --> 06:07:03,350
even just that help like help constraint
sort of the beam search of different

18214
06:07:03,350 --> 06:07:03,360
sort of the beam search of different
 

18215
06:07:03,360 --> 06:07:05,110
sort of the beam search of different
approaches that we could explore really

18216
06:07:05,110 --> 06:07:05,120
approaches that we could explore really
 

18217
06:07:05,120 --> 06:07:07,150
approaches that we could explore really
helps accelerate for the next person you

18218
06:07:07,150 --> 06:07:07,160
helps accelerate for the next person you
 

18219
06:07:07,160 --> 06:07:08,230
helps accelerate for the next person you
know the set of things that we'll get to

18220
06:07:08,230 --> 06:07:08,240
know the set of things that we'll get to
 

18221
06:07:08,240 --> 06:07:09,910
know the set of things that we'll get to
try on day one how fast we hopefully get

18222
06:07:09,910 --> 06:07:09,920
try on day one how fast we hopefully get
 

18223
06:07:09,920 --> 06:07:11,708
try on day one how fast we hopefully get
them to useful control how fast we can

18224
06:07:11,708 --> 06:07:11,718
them to useful control how fast we can
 

18225
06:07:11,718 --> 06:07:13,548
them to useful control how fast we can
enable them to use it independently and

18226
06:07:13,548 --> 06:07:13,558
enable them to use it independently and
 

18227
06:07:13,558 --> 06:07:15,190
enable them to use it independently and
to get value out of the system so yeah

18228
06:07:15,190 --> 06:07:15,200
to get value out of the system so yeah
 

18229
06:07:15,200 --> 06:07:16,990
to get value out of the system so yeah
massive hats off to to Noland and and

18230
06:07:16,990 --> 06:07:17,000
massive hats off to to Noland and and
 

18231
06:07:17,000 --> 06:07:18,070
massive hats off to to Noland and and
all the participants that came before

18232
06:07:18,070 --> 06:07:18,080
all the participants that came before
 

18233
06:07:18,080 --> 06:07:20,868
all the participants that came before
him uh to make this technology a reality

18234
06:07:20,868 --> 06:07:20,878
him uh to make this technology a reality
 

18235
06:07:20,878 --> 06:07:22,350
him uh to make this technology a reality
so how often are the updates to the

18236
06:07:22,350 --> 06:07:22,360
so how often are the updates to the
 

18237
06:07:22,360 --> 06:07:24,548
so how often are the updates to the
decoder because Nolan mentioned like

18238
06:07:24,548 --> 06:07:24,558
decoder because Nolan mentioned like
 

18239
06:07:24,558 --> 06:07:25,868
decoder because Nolan mentioned like
okay there's a new update that we're

18240
06:07:25,868 --> 06:07:25,878
okay there's a new update that we're
 

18241
06:07:25,878 --> 06:07:28,150
okay there's a new update that we're
working on and that in the Stream he

18242
06:07:28,150 --> 06:07:28,160
working on and that in the Stream he
 

18243
06:07:28,160 --> 06:07:31,708
working on and that in the Stream he
said he plays the snake game because

18244
06:07:31,708 --> 06:07:31,718
said he plays the snake game because
 

18245
06:07:31,718 --> 06:07:34,110
said he plays the snake game because
it's like super hard it's a good way for

18246
06:07:34,110 --> 06:07:34,120
it's like super hard it's a good way for
 

18247
06:07:34,120 --> 06:07:36,310
it's like super hard it's a good way for
him to test like how good the date

18248
06:07:36,310 --> 06:07:36,320
him to test like how good the date
 

18249
06:07:36,320 --> 06:07:38,830
him to test like how good the date
is so and he says like sometimes the

18250
06:07:38,830 --> 06:07:38,840
is so and he says like sometimes the
 

18251
06:07:38,840 --> 06:07:41,070
is so and he says like sometimes the
update is a a step backwards it's like

18252
06:07:41,070 --> 06:07:41,080
update is a a step backwards it's like
 

18253
06:07:41,080 --> 06:07:43,670
update is a a step backwards it's like
it's a constant like iteration so how

18254
06:07:43,670 --> 06:07:43,680
it's a constant like iteration so how
 

18255
06:07:43,680 --> 06:07:45,948
it's a constant like iteration so how
often like what does the update entail

18256
06:07:45,948 --> 06:07:45,958
often like what does the update entail
 

18257
06:07:45,958 --> 06:07:49,030
often like what does the update entail
is it mostly on the decoder side yeah

18258
06:07:49,030 --> 06:07:49,040
is it mostly on the decoder side yeah
 

18259
06:07:49,040 --> 06:07:50,510
is it mostly on the decoder side yeah
couple comments so one is it's probably

18260
06:07:50,510 --> 06:07:50,520
couple comments so one is it's probably
 

18261
06:07:50,520 --> 06:07:51,830
couple comments so one is it's probably
worth drawing distinction between sort

18262
06:07:51,830 --> 06:07:51,840
worth drawing distinction between sort
 

18263
06:07:51,840 --> 06:07:53,030
worth drawing distinction between sort
of research sessions where we're

18264
06:07:53,030 --> 06:07:53,040
of research sessions where we're
 

18265
06:07:53,040 --> 06:07:54,750
of research sessions where we're
actively trying different things to

18266
06:07:54,750 --> 06:07:54,760
actively trying different things to
 

18267
06:07:54,760 --> 06:07:55,910
actively trying different things to
understand like what the best approach

18268
06:07:55,910 --> 06:07:55,920
understand like what the best approach
 

18269
06:07:55,920 --> 06:07:57,670
understand like what the best approach
is versus sort of independent use where

18270
06:07:57,670 --> 06:07:57,680
is versus sort of independent use where
 

18271
06:07:57,680 --> 06:07:59,190
is versus sort of independent use where
we wanted to have you know ability to

18272
06:07:59,190 --> 06:07:59,200
we wanted to have you know ability to
 

18273
06:07:59,200 --> 06:08:00,948
we wanted to have you know ability to
just go use a device how anybody would

18274
06:08:00,948 --> 06:08:00,958
just go use a device how anybody would
 

18275
06:08:00,958 --> 06:08:03,310
just go use a device how anybody would
want to use their MacBook and uh so what

18276
06:08:03,310 --> 06:08:03,320
want to use their MacBook and uh so what
 

18277
06:08:03,320 --> 06:08:04,670
want to use their MacBook and uh so what
he's referring to is I think usually in

18278
06:08:04,670 --> 06:08:04,680
he's referring to is I think usually in
 

18279
06:08:04,680 --> 06:08:05,990
he's referring to is I think usually in
the context of research session where

18280
06:08:05,990 --> 06:08:06,000
the context of research session where
 

18281
06:08:06,000 --> 06:08:07,670
the context of research session where
we're trying you know many many

18282
06:08:07,670 --> 06:08:07,680
we're trying you know many many
 

18283
06:08:07,680 --> 06:08:09,270
we're trying you know many many
different approaches to you know even

18284
06:08:09,270 --> 06:08:09,280
different approaches to you know even
 

18285
06:08:09,280 --> 06:08:10,468
different approaches to you know even
unsupervised approaches like we talked

18286
06:08:10,468 --> 06:08:10,478
unsupervised approaches like we talked
 

18287
06:08:10,478 --> 06:08:12,030
unsupervised approaches like we talked
about earlier to to try to come up with

18288
06:08:12,030 --> 06:08:12,040
about earlier to to try to come up with
 

18289
06:08:12,040 --> 06:08:13,150
about earlier to to try to come up with
better ways to estimate his true

18290
06:08:13,150 --> 06:08:13,160
better ways to estimate his true
 

18291
06:08:13,160 --> 06:08:15,788
better ways to estimate his true
intention and more accurately decoded

18292
06:08:15,788 --> 06:08:15,798
intention and more accurately decoded
 

18293
06:08:15,798 --> 06:08:18,190
intention and more accurately decoded
and uh in those scenarios I mean we try

18294
06:08:18,190 --> 06:08:18,200
and uh in those scenarios I mean we try
 

18295
06:08:18,200 --> 06:08:19,788
and uh in those scenarios I mean we try
in any given session he'll sometimes

18296
06:08:19,788 --> 06:08:19,798
in any given session he'll sometimes
 

18297
06:08:19,798 --> 06:08:21,708
in any given session he'll sometimes
work for like eight hours a day and so

18298
06:08:21,708 --> 06:08:21,718
work for like eight hours a day and so
 

18299
06:08:21,718 --> 06:08:22,910
work for like eight hours a day and so
that can be you know hundreds of

18300
06:08:22,910 --> 06:08:22,920
that can be you know hundreds of
 

18301
06:08:22,920 --> 06:08:24,110
that can be you know hundreds of
different models that we would try in

18302
06:08:24,110 --> 06:08:24,120
different models that we would try in
 

18303
06:08:24,120 --> 06:08:27,030
different models that we would try in
that day like a lot of different things

18304
06:08:27,030 --> 06:08:27,040
that day like a lot of different things
 

18305
06:08:27,040 --> 06:08:28,868
that day like a lot of different things
um now it's also worth noting that we

18306
06:08:28,868 --> 06:08:28,878
um now it's also worth noting that we
 

18307
06:08:28,878 --> 06:08:30,350
um now it's also worth noting that we
update the application he uses quite

18308
06:08:30,350 --> 06:08:30,360
update the application he uses quite
 

18309
06:08:30,360 --> 06:08:31,750
update the application he uses quite
frequently I think you know sometimes up

18310
06:08:31,750 --> 06:08:31,760
frequently I think you know sometimes up
 

18311
06:08:31,760 --> 06:08:33,548
frequently I think you know sometimes up
to like four or five times a day we'll

18312
06:08:33,548 --> 06:08:33,558
to like four or five times a day we'll
 

18313
06:08:33,558 --> 06:08:34,868
to like four or five times a day we'll
update his application with different

18314
06:08:34,868 --> 06:08:34,878
update his application with different
 

18315
06:08:34,878 --> 06:08:36,990
update his application with different
features or or bug fixes or feedback

18316
06:08:36,990 --> 06:08:37,000
features or or bug fixes or feedback
 

18317
06:08:37,000 --> 06:08:39,310
features or or bug fixes or feedback
that he's given us so he's been able to

18318
06:08:39,310 --> 06:08:39,320
that he's given us so he's been able to
 

18319
06:08:39,320 --> 06:08:41,910
that he's given us so he's been able to
he's a very articulate person who uh is

18320
06:08:41,910 --> 06:08:41,920
he's a very articulate person who uh is
 

18321
06:08:41,920 --> 06:08:42,868
he's a very articulate person who uh is
part of the solution he's not a

18322
06:08:42,868 --> 06:08:42,878
part of the solution he's not a
 

18323
06:08:42,878 --> 06:08:44,150
part of the solution he's not a
complaining person he says hey here's

18324
06:08:44,150 --> 06:08:44,160
complaining person he says hey here's
 

18325
06:08:44,160 --> 06:08:46,350
complaining person he says hey here's
this thing that I've I've discovered is

18326
06:08:46,350 --> 06:08:46,360
this thing that I've I've discovered is
 

18327
06:08:46,360 --> 06:08:48,110
this thing that I've I've discovered is
is not optimal in my flow here's some

18328
06:08:48,110 --> 06:08:48,120
is not optimal in my flow here's some
 

18329
06:08:48,120 --> 06:08:49,670
is not optimal in my flow here's some
ideas how to fix it let me know what

18330
06:08:49,670 --> 06:08:49,680
ideas how to fix it let me know what
 

18331
06:08:49,680 --> 06:08:50,788
ideas how to fix it let me know what
your thoughts are let's figure out how

18332
06:08:50,788 --> 06:08:50,798
your thoughts are let's figure out how
 

18333
06:08:50,798 --> 06:08:53,270
your thoughts are let's figure out how
to how to solve it and it often happens

18334
06:08:53,270 --> 06:08:53,280
to how to solve it and it often happens
 

18335
06:08:53,280 --> 06:08:54,788
to how to solve it and it often happens
that those things are addressed within

18336
06:08:54,788 --> 06:08:54,798
that those things are addressed within
 

18337
06:08:54,798 --> 06:08:56,270
that those things are addressed within
you know a couple hours of him giving us

18338
06:08:56,270 --> 06:08:56,280
you know a couple hours of him giving us
 

18339
06:08:56,280 --> 06:08:57,510
you know a couple hours of him giving us
his feedback because that's the kind of

18340
06:08:57,510 --> 06:08:57,520
his feedback because that's the kind of
 

18341
06:08:57,520 --> 06:08:58,830
his feedback because that's the kind of
iteration cycle we'll have and so

18342
06:08:58,830 --> 06:08:58,840
iteration cycle we'll have and so
 

18343
06:08:58,840 --> 06:08:59,830
iteration cycle we'll have and so
sometimes at the beginning of the

18344
06:08:59,830 --> 06:08:59,840
sometimes at the beginning of the
 

18345
06:08:59,840 --> 06:09:00,788
sometimes at the beginning of the
session he'll give us feedback and at

18346
06:09:00,788 --> 06:09:00,798
session he'll give us feedback and at
 

18347
06:09:00,798 --> 06:09:02,510
session he'll give us feedback and at
the end of the session he's he's giving

18348
06:09:02,510 --> 06:09:02,520
the end of the session he's he's giving
 

18349
06:09:02,520 --> 06:09:03,948
the end of the session he's he's giving
us feedback on the next iteration of

18350
06:09:03,948 --> 06:09:03,958
us feedback on the next iteration of
 

18351
06:09:03,958 --> 06:09:06,030
us feedback on the next iteration of
that of that of that process that set up

18352
06:09:06,030 --> 06:09:06,040
that of that of that process that set up
 

18353
06:09:06,040 --> 06:09:07,430
that of that of that process that set up
that's fascinating cuz one of the things

18354
06:09:07,430 --> 06:09:07,440
that's fascinating cuz one of the things
 

18355
06:09:07,440 --> 06:09:09,910
that's fascinating cuz one of the things
you mentioned that there was 271 pages

18356
06:09:09,910 --> 06:09:09,920
you mentioned that there was 271 pages
 

18357
06:09:09,920 --> 06:09:12,628
you mentioned that there was 271 pages
of notes taken from the BCI sessions and

18358
06:09:12,628 --> 06:09:12,638
of notes taken from the BCI sessions and
 

18359
06:09:12,638 --> 06:09:15,510
of notes taken from the BCI sessions and
this was just in March so one of the

18360
06:09:15,510 --> 06:09:15,520
this was just in March so one of the
 

18361
06:09:15,520 --> 06:09:17,270
this was just in March so one of the
amazing things about human beings that

18362
06:09:17,270 --> 06:09:17,280
amazing things about human beings that
 

18363
06:09:17,280 --> 06:09:20,150
amazing things about human beings that
they can provide especially ones who are

18364
06:09:20,150 --> 06:09:20,160
they can provide especially ones who are
 

18365
06:09:20,160 --> 06:09:23,310
they can provide especially ones who are
uh smart and excited and all like

18366
06:09:23,310 --> 06:09:23,320
uh smart and excited and all like
 

18367
06:09:23,320 --> 06:09:25,510
uh smart and excited and all like
positive and Good Vibes like noan that

18368
06:09:25,510 --> 06:09:25,520
positive and Good Vibes like noan that
 

18369
06:09:25,520 --> 06:09:27,030
positive and Good Vibes like noan that
they can provide feedback continuous

18370
06:09:27,030 --> 06:09:27,040
they can provide feedback continuous
 

18371
06:09:27,040 --> 06:09:29,590
they can provide feedback continuous
feedback yeah it also requires just to

18372
06:09:29,590 --> 06:09:29,600
feedback yeah it also requires just to
 

18373
06:09:29,600 --> 06:09:30,990
feedback yeah it also requires just to
brag on the team a little bit I work

18374
06:09:30,990 --> 06:09:31,000
brag on the team a little bit I work
 

18375
06:09:31,000 --> 06:09:33,510
brag on the team a little bit I work
with a lot of exceptional people and it

18376
06:09:33,510 --> 06:09:33,520
with a lot of exceptional people and it
 

18377
06:09:33,520 --> 06:09:35,750
with a lot of exceptional people and it
requires the team being absolutely laser

18378
06:09:35,750 --> 06:09:35,760
requires the team being absolutely laser
 

18379
06:09:35,760 --> 06:09:37,628
requires the team being absolutely laser
focused on the user and what will be the

18380
06:09:37,628 --> 06:09:37,638
focused on the user and what will be the
 

18381
06:09:37,638 --> 06:09:39,708
focused on the user and what will be the
best for them and it requires like a

18382
06:09:39,708 --> 06:09:39,718
best for them and it requires like a
 

18383
06:09:39,718 --> 06:09:41,670
best for them and it requires like a
level of commitment of okay this is what

18384
06:09:41,670 --> 06:09:41,680
level of commitment of okay this is what
 

18385
06:09:41,680 --> 06:09:42,910
level of commitment of okay this is what
the user feedback was I have all these

18386
06:09:42,910 --> 06:09:42,920
the user feedback was I have all these
 

18387
06:09:42,920 --> 06:09:43,990
the user feedback was I have all these
meetings we're going to skip that today

18388
06:09:43,990 --> 06:09:44,000
meetings we're going to skip that today
 

18389
06:09:44,000 --> 06:09:45,510
meetings we're going to skip that today
and we're going to do this you know that

18390
06:09:45,510 --> 06:09:45,520
and we're going to do this you know that
 

18391
06:09:45,520 --> 06:09:48,910
and we're going to do this you know that
level of focus commitment is uh I would

18392
06:09:48,910 --> 06:09:48,920
level of focus commitment is uh I would
 

18393
06:09:48,920 --> 06:09:52,628
level of focus commitment is uh I would
say under underappreciated in the world

18394
06:09:52,628 --> 06:09:52,638
say under underappreciated in the world
 

18395
06:09:52,638 --> 06:09:54,230
say under underappreciated in the world
and also uh you know you obviously have

18396
06:09:54,230 --> 06:09:54,240
and also uh you know you obviously have
 

18397
06:09:54,240 --> 06:09:55,310
and also uh you know you obviously have
to have the talent to be able to execute

18398
06:09:55,310 --> 06:09:55,320
to have the talent to be able to execute
 

18399
06:09:55,320 --> 06:09:58,230
to have the talent to be able to execute
on these things effectively and uh yeah

18400
06:09:58,230 --> 06:09:58,240
on these things effectively and uh yeah
 

18401
06:09:58,240 --> 06:10:00,948
on these things effectively and uh yeah
we have that in in loads yeah and this

18402
06:10:00,948 --> 06:10:00,958
we have that in in loads yeah and this
 

18403
06:10:00,958 --> 06:10:05,030
we have that in in loads yeah and this
is such a interesting space of ux design

18404
06:10:05,030 --> 06:10:05,040
is such a interesting space of ux design
 

18405
06:10:05,040 --> 06:10:07,110
is such a interesting space of ux design
because because you have there's so many

18406
06:10:07,110 --> 06:10:07,120
because because you have there's so many
 

18407
06:10:07,120 --> 06:10:08,510
because because you have there's so many
unknowns

18408
06:10:08,510 --> 06:10:08,520
unknowns
 

18409
06:10:08,520 --> 06:10:12,948
unknowns
here and I can tell ux is difficult

18410
06:10:12,948 --> 06:10:12,958
here and I can tell ux is difficult
 

18411
06:10:12,958 --> 06:10:16,270
here and I can tell ux is difficult
because of how many people do it

18412
06:10:16,270 --> 06:10:16,280
because of how many people do it
 

18413
06:10:16,280 --> 06:10:19,310
because of how many people do it
poorly it's just not a trivial thing

18414
06:10:19,310 --> 06:10:19,320
poorly it's just not a trivial thing
 

18415
06:10:19,320 --> 06:10:20,948
poorly it's just not a trivial thing
yeah it's also you know ux is not

18416
06:10:20,948 --> 06:10:20,958
yeah it's also you know ux is not
 

18417
06:10:20,958 --> 06:10:23,830
yeah it's also you know ux is not
something that you can always solve by

18418
06:10:23,830 --> 06:10:23,840
something that you can always solve by
 

18419
06:10:23,840 --> 06:10:25,468
something that you can always solve by
just constant iterating on different

18420
06:10:25,468 --> 06:10:25,478
just constant iterating on different
 

18421
06:10:25,478 --> 06:10:26,670
just constant iterating on different
things like sometimes you really need to

18422
06:10:26,670 --> 06:10:26,680
things like sometimes you really need to
 

18423
06:10:26,680 --> 06:10:28,910
things like sometimes you really need to
step back and think globally am I even

18424
06:10:28,910 --> 06:10:28,920
step back and think globally am I even
 

18425
06:10:28,920 --> 06:10:30,310
step back and think globally am I even
like the right sort of Minima to be

18426
06:10:30,310 --> 06:10:30,320
like the right sort of Minima to be
 

18427
06:10:30,320 --> 06:10:32,270
like the right sort of Minima to be
chasing down for a solution like there's

18428
06:10:32,270 --> 06:10:32,280
chasing down for a solution like there's
 

18429
06:10:32,280 --> 06:10:33,750
chasing down for a solution like there's
a lot of problems in which sort of fast

18430
06:10:33,750 --> 06:10:33,760
a lot of problems in which sort of fast
 

18431
06:10:33,760 --> 06:10:35,750
a lot of problems in which sort of fast
iteration cycle is the

18432
06:10:35,750 --> 06:10:35,760
iteration cycle is the
 

18433
06:10:35,760 --> 06:10:37,150
iteration cycle is the
the predictor of how successful you will

18434
06:10:37,150 --> 06:10:37,160
the predictor of how successful you will
 

18435
06:10:37,160 --> 06:10:39,948
the predictor of how successful you will
be as a good example like in a in an RL

18436
06:10:39,948 --> 06:10:39,958
be as a good example like in a in an RL
 

18437
06:10:39,958 --> 06:10:41,190
be as a good example like in a in an RL
simulation for example the more

18438
06:10:41,190 --> 06:10:41,200
simulation for example the more
 

18439
06:10:41,200 --> 06:10:42,750
simulation for example the more
frequently you get reward the faster you

18440
06:10:42,750 --> 06:10:42,760
frequently you get reward the faster you
 

18441
06:10:42,760 --> 06:10:44,590
frequently you get reward the faster you
can progress it's just an easier

18442
06:10:44,590 --> 06:10:44,600
can progress it's just an easier
 

18443
06:10:44,600 --> 06:10:45,788
can progress it's just an easier
learning problem the more frequently you

18444
06:10:45,788 --> 06:10:45,798
learning problem the more frequently you
 

18445
06:10:45,798 --> 06:10:47,788
learning problem the more frequently you
get feedback but ux is not that way I

18446
06:10:47,788 --> 06:10:47,798
get feedback but ux is not that way I
 

18447
06:10:47,798 --> 06:10:50,070
get feedback but ux is not that way I
mean users are actually quite often

18448
06:10:50,070 --> 06:10:50,080
mean users are actually quite often
 

18449
06:10:50,080 --> 06:10:51,990
mean users are actually quite often
wrong about what the right solution is

18450
06:10:51,990 --> 06:10:52,000
wrong about what the right solution is
 

18451
06:10:52,000 --> 06:10:53,548
wrong about what the right solution is
and it requires a deep understanding of

18452
06:10:53,548 --> 06:10:53,558
and it requires a deep understanding of
 

18453
06:10:53,558 --> 06:10:56,030
and it requires a deep understanding of
the technical system and what's possible

18454
06:10:56,030 --> 06:10:56,040
the technical system and what's possible
 

18455
06:10:56,040 --> 06:10:57,230
the technical system and what's possible
combined with what the problem is you're

18456
06:10:57,230 --> 06:10:57,240
combined with what the problem is you're
 

18457
06:10:57,240 --> 06:10:59,110
combined with what the problem is you're
trying to solve not just how the user

18458
06:10:59,110 --> 06:10:59,120
trying to solve not just how the user
 

18459
06:10:59,120 --> 06:11:00,868
trying to solve not just how the user
express it but what the true underlying

18460
06:11:00,868 --> 06:11:00,878
express it but what the true underlying
 

18461
06:11:00,878 --> 06:11:03,110
express it but what the true underlying
problem is to actually get to the right

18462
06:11:03,110 --> 06:11:03,120
problem is to actually get to the right
 

18463
06:11:03,120 --> 06:11:05,628
problem is to actually get to the right
place yeah that's the old like story of

18464
06:11:05,628 --> 06:11:05,638
place yeah that's the old like story of
 

18465
06:11:05,638 --> 06:11:09,030
place yeah that's the old like story of
Steve Jobs like rolling in there like

18466
06:11:09,030 --> 06:11:09,040
Steve Jobs like rolling in there like
 

18467
06:11:09,040 --> 06:11:10,948
Steve Jobs like rolling in there like
yeah the user is a good is a useful

18468
06:11:10,948 --> 06:11:10,958
yeah the user is a good is a useful
 

18469
06:11:10,958 --> 06:11:13,590
yeah the user is a good is a useful
signal but it's not a perfect signal and

18470
06:11:13,590 --> 06:11:13,600
signal but it's not a perfect signal and
 

18471
06:11:13,600 --> 06:11:15,270
signal but it's not a perfect signal and
sometimes you have to remove the floppy

18472
06:11:15,270 --> 06:11:15,280
sometimes you have to remove the floppy
 

18473
06:11:15,280 --> 06:11:17,788
sometimes you have to remove the floppy
disc drive or whatever the I forgot all

18474
06:11:17,788 --> 06:11:17,798
disc drive or whatever the I forgot all
 

18475
06:11:17,798 --> 06:11:19,990
disc drive or whatever the I forgot all
the crazy stories of Steve Jobs like

18476
06:11:19,990 --> 06:11:20,000
the crazy stories of Steve Jobs like
 

18477
06:11:20,000 --> 06:11:24,510
the crazy stories of Steve Jobs like
making wild uh design decisions but

18478
06:11:24,510 --> 06:11:24,520
making wild uh design decisions but
 

18479
06:11:24,520 --> 06:11:28,310
making wild uh design decisions but
there some some of his

18480
06:11:28,310 --> 06:11:28,320

 

18481
06:11:28,320 --> 06:11:31,948

aesthetic that some of it is about the

18482
06:11:31,948 --> 06:11:31,958
aesthetic that some of it is about the
 

18483
06:11:31,958 --> 06:11:34,110
aesthetic that some of it is about the
love you put into the design which is

18484
06:11:34,110 --> 06:11:34,120
love you put into the design which is
 

18485
06:11:34,120 --> 06:11:37,430
love you put into the design which is
very much as Steve Job J Johnny I type

18486
06:11:37,430 --> 06:11:37,440
very much as Steve Job J Johnny I type
 

18487
06:11:37,440 --> 06:11:40,030
very much as Steve Job J Johnny I type
thing but when when you have a human

18488
06:11:40,030 --> 06:11:40,040
thing but when when you have a human
 

18489
06:11:40,040 --> 06:11:42,230
thing but when when you have a human
being using their brain to interact with

18490
06:11:42,230 --> 06:11:42,240
being using their brain to interact with
 

18491
06:11:42,240 --> 06:11:44,110
being using their brain to interact with
it there it also is deeply about

18492
06:11:44,110 --> 06:11:44,120
it there it also is deeply about
 

18493
06:11:44,120 --> 06:11:47,948
it there it also is deeply about
function it's not just aesthetic Y and

18494
06:11:47,948 --> 06:11:47,958
function it's not just aesthetic Y and
 

18495
06:11:47,958 --> 06:11:50,468
function it's not just aesthetic Y and
that you have to empathize with with a

18496
06:11:50,468 --> 06:11:50,478
that you have to empathize with with a
 

18497
06:11:50,478 --> 06:11:53,350
that you have to empathize with with a
human being before you while not always

18498
06:11:53,350 --> 06:11:53,360
human being before you while not always
 

18499
06:11:53,360 --> 06:11:54,868
human being before you while not always
listening to them

18500
06:11:54,868 --> 06:11:54,878
listening to them
 

18501
06:11:54,878 --> 06:11:57,270
listening to them
directly like you have to deeply

18502
06:11:57,270 --> 06:11:57,280
directly like you have to deeply
 

18503
06:11:57,280 --> 06:12:00,430
directly like you have to deeply
empathize it's fascinating it's really

18504
06:12:00,430 --> 06:12:00,440
empathize it's fascinating it's really
 

18505
06:12:00,440 --> 06:12:02,750
empathize it's fascinating it's really
really fascinating and at the same time

18506
06:12:02,750 --> 06:12:02,760
really fascinating and at the same time
 

18507
06:12:02,760 --> 06:12:04,948
really fascinating and at the same time
iterate right but not iterate in small

18508
06:12:04,948 --> 06:12:04,958
iterate right but not iterate in small
 

18509
06:12:04,958 --> 06:12:06,510
iterate right but not iterate in small
ways sometimes a

18510
06:12:06,510 --> 06:12:06,520
ways sometimes a
 

18511
06:12:06,520 --> 06:12:09,030
ways sometimes a
complete like rebuilding the design he

18512
06:12:09,030 --> 06:12:09,040
complete like rebuilding the design he
 

18513
06:12:09,040 --> 06:12:11,788
complete like rebuilding the design he
said that noan said the early days the

18514
06:12:11,788 --> 06:12:11,798
said that noan said the early days the
 

18515
06:12:11,798 --> 06:12:14,670
said that noan said the early days the
ux sucked yeah but you improved quickly

18516
06:12:14,670 --> 06:12:14,680
ux sucked yeah but you improved quickly
 

18517
06:12:14,680 --> 06:12:17,310
ux sucked yeah but you improved quickly
what was that Journey like yeah I mean

18518
06:12:17,310 --> 06:12:17,320
what was that Journey like yeah I mean
 

18519
06:12:17,320 --> 06:12:20,390
what was that Journey like yeah I mean
I'll give one concrete example so uh he

18520
06:12:20,390 --> 06:12:20,400
I'll give one concrete example so uh he
 

18521
06:12:20,400 --> 06:12:22,030
I'll give one concrete example so uh he
really wanted to be able to Read Manga

18522
06:12:22,030 --> 06:12:22,040
really wanted to be able to Read Manga
 

18523
06:12:22,040 --> 06:12:23,948
really wanted to be able to Read Manga
this is something that he I mean yeah it

18524
06:12:23,948 --> 06:12:23,958
this is something that he I mean yeah it
 

18525
06:12:23,958 --> 06:12:24,990
this is something that he I mean yeah it
sounds like a simple thing but it's

18526
06:12:24,990 --> 06:12:25,000
sounds like a simple thing but it's
 

18527
06:12:25,000 --> 06:12:26,750
sounds like a simple thing but it's
actually a really big deal for for him

18528
06:12:26,750 --> 06:12:26,760
actually a really big deal for for him
 

18529
06:12:26,760 --> 06:12:28,150
actually a really big deal for for him
and he couldn't do it with this mouse

18530
06:12:28,150 --> 06:12:28,160
and he couldn't do it with this mouse
 

18531
06:12:28,160 --> 06:12:29,830
and he couldn't do it with this mouse
stick it just it wasn't accessible you

18532
06:12:29,830 --> 06:12:29,840
stick it just it wasn't accessible you
 

18533
06:12:29,840 --> 06:12:31,350
stick it just it wasn't accessible you
can't scroll with the mouse sck on his

18534
06:12:31,350 --> 06:12:31,360
can't scroll with the mouse sck on his
 

18535
06:12:31,360 --> 06:12:33,190
can't scroll with the mouse sck on his
iPad and the on the website that he

18536
06:12:33,190 --> 06:12:33,200
iPad and the on the website that he
 

18537
06:12:33,200 --> 06:12:34,910
iPad and the on the website that he
wanted to be able to use to read the the

18538
06:12:34,910 --> 06:12:34,920
wanted to be able to use to read the the
 

18539
06:12:34,920 --> 06:12:36,990
wanted to be able to use to read the the
new mang so might be a good quick pause

18540
06:12:36,990 --> 06:12:37,000
new mang so might be a good quick pause
 

18541
06:12:37,000 --> 06:12:39,110
new mang so might be a good quick pause
to say the mouth stick is the thing he's

18542
06:12:39,110 --> 06:12:39,120
to say the mouth stick is the thing he's
 

18543
06:12:39,120 --> 06:12:42,270
to say the mouth stick is the thing he's
using holding a stick in his mouth to

18544
06:12:42,270 --> 06:12:42,280
using holding a stick in his mouth to
 

18545
06:12:42,280 --> 06:12:44,670
using holding a stick in his mouth to
scroll on a tablet right yeah it's

18546
06:12:44,670 --> 06:12:44,680
scroll on a tablet right yeah it's
 

18547
06:12:44,680 --> 06:12:46,230
scroll on a tablet right yeah it's
basically you can imagine it's a stylus

18548
06:12:46,230 --> 06:12:46,240
basically you can imagine it's a stylus
 

18549
06:12:46,240 --> 06:12:47,548
basically you can imagine it's a stylus
that you hold between your teeth it's

18550
06:12:47,548 --> 06:12:47,558
that you hold between your teeth it's
 

18551
06:12:47,558 --> 06:12:49,110
that you hold between your teeth it's
basically a very long stylus and it's

18552
06:12:49,110 --> 06:12:49,120
basically a very long stylus and it's
 

18553
06:12:49,120 --> 06:12:53,590
basically a very long stylus and it's
it's exhausting it's it hurts and it's

18554
06:12:53,590 --> 06:12:53,600
it's exhausting it's it hurts and it's
 

18555
06:12:53,600 --> 06:12:55,548
it's exhausting it's it hurts and it's
inefficient yeah and maybe it's also

18556
06:12:55,548 --> 06:12:55,558
inefficient yeah and maybe it's also
 

18557
06:12:55,558 --> 06:12:56,590
inefficient yeah and maybe it's also
worth calling out there are other

18558
06:12:56,590 --> 06:12:56,600
worth calling out there are other
 

18559
06:12:56,600 --> 06:12:58,310
worth calling out there are other
alternative assistant Technologies but

18560
06:12:58,310 --> 06:12:58,320
alternative assistant Technologies but
 

18561
06:12:58,320 --> 06:13:00,468
alternative assistant Technologies but
uh the particular situation Nolan's in

18562
06:13:00,468 --> 06:13:00,478
uh the particular situation Nolan's in
 

18563
06:13:00,478 --> 06:13:02,030
uh the particular situation Nolan's in
and this is not uncommon and I think

18564
06:13:02,030 --> 06:13:02,040
and this is not uncommon and I think
 

18565
06:13:02,040 --> 06:13:03,990
and this is not uncommon and I think
it's also not well understood by folks

18566
06:13:03,990 --> 06:13:04,000
it's also not well understood by folks
 

18567
06:13:04,000 --> 06:13:05,990
it's also not well understood by folks
is that you know he's relatively

18568
06:13:05,990 --> 06:13:06,000
is that you know he's relatively
 

18569
06:13:06,000 --> 06:13:07,510
is that you know he's relatively
so he'll have muscle spasms from time to

18570
06:13:07,510 --> 06:13:07,520
so he'll have muscle spasms from time to
 

18571
06:13:07,520 --> 06:13:09,150
so he'll have muscle spasms from time to
time and so any assistant technology

18572
06:13:09,150 --> 06:13:09,160
time and so any assistant technology
 

18573
06:13:09,160 --> 06:13:10,310
time and so any assistant technology
that requires him to be positioned

18574
06:13:10,310 --> 06:13:10,320
that requires him to be positioned
 

18575
06:13:10,320 --> 06:13:11,390
that requires him to be positioned
directly in front of a camera for

18576
06:13:11,390 --> 06:13:11,400
directly in front of a camera for
 

18577
06:13:11,400 --> 06:13:13,110
directly in front of a camera for
example an eye tracker or anything that

18578
06:13:13,110 --> 06:13:13,120
example an eye tracker or anything that
 

18579
06:13:13,120 --> 06:13:14,230
example an eye tracker or anything that
requires him to put something in his

18580
06:13:14,230 --> 06:13:14,240
requires him to put something in his
 

18581
06:13:14,240 --> 06:13:16,830
requires him to put something in his
mouth just as a nogo because he'll

18582
06:13:16,830 --> 06:13:16,840
mouth just as a nogo because he'll
 

18583
06:13:16,840 --> 06:13:18,310
mouth just as a nogo because he'll
either be shifted out of frame when he

18584
06:13:18,310 --> 06:13:18,320
either be shifted out of frame when he
 

18585
06:13:18,320 --> 06:13:20,070
either be shifted out of frame when he
has a spasm or if he has something in

18586
06:13:20,070 --> 06:13:20,080
has a spasm or if he has something in
 

18587
06:13:20,080 --> 06:13:21,468
has a spasm or if he has something in
his mouth it'll stab him in the in the

18588
06:13:21,468 --> 06:13:21,478
his mouth it'll stab him in the in the
 

18589
06:13:21,478 --> 06:13:23,350
his mouth it'll stab him in the in the
face you know if he spasms too hard so

18590
06:13:23,350 --> 06:13:23,360
face you know if he spasms too hard so
 

18591
06:13:23,360 --> 06:13:24,430
face you know if he spasms too hard so
these kind of considerations are

18592
06:13:24,430 --> 06:13:24,440
these kind of considerations are
 

18593
06:13:24,440 --> 06:13:25,868
these kind of considerations are
important when thinking about what

18594
06:13:25,868 --> 06:13:25,878
important when thinking about what
 

18595
06:13:25,878 --> 06:13:27,628
important when thinking about what
advantages a PCI has in someone's life

18596
06:13:27,628 --> 06:13:27,638
advantages a PCI has in someone's life
 

18597
06:13:27,638 --> 06:13:29,270
advantages a PCI has in someone's life
if if it fits ergonomically into your

18598
06:13:29,270 --> 06:13:29,280
if if it fits ergonomically into your
 

18599
06:13:29,280 --> 06:13:30,628
if if it fits ergonomically into your
life in a way that you can use it

18600
06:13:30,628 --> 06:13:30,638
life in a way that you can use it
 

18601
06:13:30,638 --> 06:13:32,310
life in a way that you can use it
independently when your caretaker's not

18602
06:13:32,310 --> 06:13:32,320
independently when your caretaker's not
 

18603
06:13:32,320 --> 06:13:34,310
independently when your caretaker's not
there wherever you want to either in the

18604
06:13:34,310 --> 06:13:34,320
there wherever you want to either in the
 

18605
06:13:34,320 --> 06:13:36,190
there wherever you want to either in the
bed or in the chair depending on you

18606
06:13:36,190 --> 06:13:36,200
bed or in the chair depending on you
 

18607
06:13:36,200 --> 06:13:37,708
bed or in the chair depending on you
know your comfort level and your desire

18608
06:13:37,708 --> 06:13:37,718
know your comfort level and your desire
 

18609
06:13:37,718 --> 06:13:39,510
know your comfort level and your desire
to have pressure Source you know all

18610
06:13:39,510 --> 06:13:39,520
to have pressure Source you know all
 

18611
06:13:39,520 --> 06:13:41,670
to have pressure Source you know all
these factors matter a lot in how good

18612
06:13:41,670 --> 06:13:41,680
these factors matter a lot in how good
 

18613
06:13:41,680 --> 06:13:44,030
these factors matter a lot in how good
the solution is in that users uh in that

18614
06:13:44,030 --> 06:13:44,040
the solution is in that users uh in that
 

18615
06:13:44,040 --> 06:13:46,990
the solution is in that users uh in that
user's life so one of these very fun

18616
06:13:46,990 --> 06:13:47,000
user's life so one of these very fun
 

18617
06:13:47,000 --> 06:13:48,910
user's life so one of these very fun
examples is scroll so again manga is

18618
06:13:48,910 --> 06:13:48,920
examples is scroll so again manga is
 

18619
06:13:48,920 --> 06:13:50,788
examples is scroll so again manga is
something he wanted to be able to read

18620
06:13:50,788 --> 06:13:50,798
something he wanted to be able to read
 

18621
06:13:50,798 --> 06:13:51,990
something he wanted to be able to read
and

18622
06:13:51,990 --> 06:13:52,000
and
 

18623
06:13:52,000 --> 06:13:54,270
and
uh there's many ways to do scroll with

18624
06:13:54,270 --> 06:13:54,280
uh there's many ways to do scroll with
 

18625
06:13:54,280 --> 06:13:56,590
uh there's many ways to do scroll with
the BCI you can imagine like different

18626
06:13:56,590 --> 06:13:56,600
the BCI you can imagine like different
 

18627
06:13:56,600 --> 06:13:58,150
the BCI you can imagine like different
gestures for example the user could do

18628
06:13:58,150 --> 06:13:58,160
gestures for example the user could do
 

18629
06:13:58,160 --> 06:14:00,310
gestures for example the user could do
that would move the move the page but

18630
06:14:00,310 --> 06:14:00,320
that would move the move the page but
 

18631
06:14:00,320 --> 06:14:02,350
that would move the move the page but
scroll is a very fascinating uh control

18632
06:14:02,350 --> 06:14:02,360
scroll is a very fascinating uh control
 

18633
06:14:02,360 --> 06:14:04,390
scroll is a very fascinating uh control
surface because it's a huge thing on

18634
06:14:04,390 --> 06:14:04,400
surface because it's a huge thing on
 

18635
06:14:04,400 --> 06:14:06,310
surface because it's a huge thing on
this on the on screen in front of you so

18636
06:14:06,310 --> 06:14:06,320
this on the on screen in front of you so
 

18637
06:14:06,320 --> 06:14:07,948
this on the on screen in front of you so
any sort of Jitter in the model output

18638
06:14:07,948 --> 06:14:07,958
any sort of Jitter in the model output
 

18639
06:14:07,958 --> 06:14:09,270
any sort of Jitter in the model output
any sort of air in the model output

18640
06:14:09,270 --> 06:14:09,280
any sort of air in the model output
 

18641
06:14:09,280 --> 06:14:10,990
any sort of air in the model output
causes like a an earthquake on the

18642
06:14:10,990 --> 06:14:11,000
causes like a an earthquake on the
 

18643
06:14:11,000 --> 06:14:12,070
causes like a an earthquake on the
screen like you really don't want to

18644
06:14:12,070 --> 06:14:12,080
screen like you really don't want to
 

18645
06:14:12,080 --> 06:14:13,070
screen like you really don't want to
have your manga page that you're trying

18646
06:14:13,070 --> 06:14:13,080
have your manga page that you're trying
 

18647
06:14:13,080 --> 06:14:15,150
have your manga page that you're trying
to read be shifted up and down a few

18648
06:14:15,150 --> 06:14:15,160
to read be shifted up and down a few
 

18649
06:14:15,160 --> 06:14:17,310
to read be shifted up and down a few
pixels just because you know your scroll

18650
06:14:17,310 --> 06:14:17,320
pixels just because you know your scroll
 

18651
06:14:17,320 --> 06:14:19,670
pixels just because you know your scroll
decoder is not completely accurate and

18652
06:14:19,670 --> 06:14:19,680
decoder is not completely accurate and
 

18653
06:14:19,680 --> 06:14:22,510
decoder is not completely accurate and
so this was an example where uh we had

18654
06:14:22,510 --> 06:14:22,520
so this was an example where uh we had
 

18655
06:14:22,520 --> 06:14:24,190
so this was an example where uh we had
to figure out how to formulate the

18656
06:14:24,190 --> 06:14:24,200
to figure out how to formulate the
 

18657
06:14:24,200 --> 06:14:25,670
to figure out how to formulate the
problem in a way that the errors of the

18658
06:14:25,670 --> 06:14:25,680
problem in a way that the errors of the
 

18659
06:14:25,680 --> 06:14:27,270
problem in a way that the errors of the
system whenever they do occur and we'll

18660
06:14:27,270 --> 06:14:27,280
system whenever they do occur and we'll
 

18661
06:14:27,280 --> 06:14:28,670
system whenever they do occur and we'll
do our best to minimize them but

18662
06:14:28,670 --> 06:14:28,680
do our best to minimize them but
 

18663
06:14:28,680 --> 06:14:30,548
do our best to minimize them but
whenever those errors do occur that it

18664
06:14:30,548 --> 06:14:30,558
whenever those errors do occur that it
 

18665
06:14:30,558 --> 06:14:32,510
whenever those errors do occur that it
doesn't interrupt the qualia again of

18666
06:14:32,510 --> 06:14:32,520
doesn't interrupt the qualia again of
 

18667
06:14:32,520 --> 06:14:34,070
doesn't interrupt the qualia again of
the experience that the user is is

18668
06:14:34,070 --> 06:14:34,080
the experience that the user is is
 

18669
06:14:34,080 --> 06:14:35,430
the experience that the user is is
having it doesn't interrupt their flow

18670
06:14:35,430 --> 06:14:35,440
having it doesn't interrupt their flow
 

18671
06:14:35,440 --> 06:14:37,230
having it doesn't interrupt their flow
of reading their book and so what we

18672
06:14:37,230 --> 06:14:37,240
of reading their book and so what we
 

18673
06:14:37,240 --> 06:14:38,990
of reading their book and so what we
ended up building is this really

18674
06:14:38,990 --> 06:14:39,000
ended up building is this really
 

18675
06:14:39,000 --> 06:14:41,948
ended up building is this really
brilliant um feature this is uh teammate

18676
06:14:41,948 --> 06:14:41,958
brilliant um feature this is uh teammate
 

18677
06:14:41,958 --> 06:14:43,430
brilliant um feature this is uh teammate
named Bru who worked on this really

18678
06:14:43,430 --> 06:14:43,440
named Bru who worked on this really
 

18679
06:14:43,440 --> 06:14:45,110
named Bru who worked on this really
brilliant work called quick scroll and

18680
06:14:45,110 --> 06:14:45,120
brilliant work called quick scroll and
 

18681
06:14:45,120 --> 06:14:46,510
brilliant work called quick scroll and
quick scroll basically looks at the

18682
06:14:46,510 --> 06:14:46,520
quick scroll basically looks at the
 

18683
06:14:46,520 --> 06:14:49,670
quick scroll basically looks at the
screen and it identifies where on the

18684
06:14:49,670 --> 06:14:49,680
screen and it identifies where on the
 

18685
06:14:49,680 --> 06:14:51,430
screen and it identifies where on the
screen are scroll bars and it does this

18686
06:14:51,430 --> 06:14:51,440
screen are scroll bars and it does this
 

18687
06:14:51,440 --> 06:14:53,270
screen are scroll bars and it does this
by deeply integrating with maest to

18688
06:14:53,270 --> 06:14:53,280
by deeply integrating with maest to
 

18689
06:14:53,280 --> 06:14:55,468
by deeply integrating with maest to
understand where are the the scroll bars

18690
06:14:55,468 --> 06:14:55,478
understand where are the the scroll bars
 

18691
06:14:55,478 --> 06:14:56,948
understand where are the the scroll bars
actively present on the screen using the

18692
06:14:56,948 --> 06:14:56,958
actively present on the screen using the
 

18693
06:14:56,958 --> 06:14:58,110
actively present on the screen using the
sort of accessibility tree that's

18694
06:14:58,110 --> 06:14:58,120
sort of accessibility tree that's
 

18695
06:14:58,120 --> 06:15:01,230
sort of accessibility tree that's
available to uh to ma apps and we

18696
06:15:01,230 --> 06:15:01,240
available to uh to ma apps and we
 

18697
06:15:01,240 --> 06:15:02,708
available to uh to ma apps and we
identified where that those scroll bars

18698
06:15:02,708 --> 06:15:02,718
identified where that those scroll bars
 

18699
06:15:02,718 --> 06:15:05,070
identified where that those scroll bars
are and we provided a BCI scroll bar and

18700
06:15:05,070 --> 06:15:05,080
are and we provided a BCI scroll bar and
 

18701
06:15:05,080 --> 06:15:07,190
are and we provided a BCI scroll bar and
the BCI scroll bar looks similar to a

18702
06:15:07,190 --> 06:15:07,200
the BCI scroll bar looks similar to a
 

18703
06:15:07,200 --> 06:15:08,670
the BCI scroll bar looks similar to a
normal scroll bar but it behaves very

18704
06:15:08,670 --> 06:15:08,680
normal scroll bar but it behaves very
 

18705
06:15:08,680 --> 06:15:10,190
normal scroll bar but it behaves very
differently in that once you sort of

18706
06:15:10,190 --> 06:15:10,200
differently in that once you sort of
 

18707
06:15:10,200 --> 06:15:11,628
differently in that once you sort of
move over to it your cursor sort of

18708
06:15:11,628 --> 06:15:11,638
move over to it your cursor sort of
 

18709
06:15:11,638 --> 06:15:13,468
move over to it your cursor sort of
morphs onto it it sort of attaches or

18710
06:15:13,468 --> 06:15:13,478
morphs onto it it sort of attaches or
 

18711
06:15:13,478 --> 06:15:16,110
morphs onto it it sort of attaches or
latches onto it and then once you push

18712
06:15:16,110 --> 06:15:16,120
latches onto it and then once you push
 

18713
06:15:16,120 --> 06:15:18,030
latches onto it and then once you push
up or down in the same way that You' use

18714
06:15:18,030 --> 06:15:18,040
up or down in the same way that You' use
 

18715
06:15:18,040 --> 06:15:19,868
up or down in the same way that You' use
a push to control you know the normal

18716
06:15:19,868 --> 06:15:19,878
a push to control you know the normal
 

18717
06:15:19,878 --> 06:15:22,390
a push to control you know the normal
cursor uh it actually moves the screen

18718
06:15:22,390 --> 06:15:22,400
cursor uh it actually moves the screen
 

18719
06:15:22,400 --> 06:15:23,990
cursor uh it actually moves the screen
for you so it's basically like remapping

18720
06:15:23,990 --> 06:15:24,000
for you so it's basically like remapping
 

18721
06:15:24,000 --> 06:15:26,708
for you so it's basically like remapping
the velocity to a scroll action and the

18722
06:15:26,708 --> 06:15:26,718
the velocity to a scroll action and the
 

18723
06:15:26,718 --> 06:15:28,070
the velocity to a scroll action and the
reason that feels so natural and

18724
06:15:28,070 --> 06:15:28,080
reason that feels so natural and
 

18725
06:15:28,080 --> 06:15:29,788
reason that feels so natural and
intuitive is that when you move over to

18726
06:15:29,788 --> 06:15:29,798
intuitive is that when you move over to
 

18727
06:15:29,798 --> 06:15:31,310
intuitive is that when you move over to
attach to it it feels like magnetic so

18728
06:15:31,310 --> 06:15:31,320
attach to it it feels like magnetic so
 

18729
06:15:31,320 --> 06:15:32,628
attach to it it feels like magnetic so
you're like sort of stuck onto it and

18730
06:15:32,628 --> 06:15:32,638
you're like sort of stuck onto it and
 

18731
06:15:32,638 --> 06:15:33,910
you're like sort of stuck onto it and
then it's one continuous action you

18732
06:15:33,910 --> 06:15:33,920
then it's one continuous action you
 

18733
06:15:33,920 --> 06:15:35,628
then it's one continuous action you
don't have to like switch your imagine

18734
06:15:35,628 --> 06:15:35,638
don't have to like switch your imagine
 

18735
06:15:35,638 --> 06:15:36,948
don't have to like switch your imagine
movement you sort of snap onto it and

18736
06:15:36,948 --> 06:15:36,958
movement you sort of snap onto it and
 

18737
06:15:36,958 --> 06:15:38,230
movement you sort of snap onto it and
then you're good to go you just

18738
06:15:38,230 --> 06:15:38,240
then you're good to go you just
 

18739
06:15:38,240 --> 06:15:39,670
then you're good to go you just
immediately can start pulling the page

18740
06:15:39,670 --> 06:15:39,680
immediately can start pulling the page
 

18741
06:15:39,680 --> 06:15:41,868
immediately can start pulling the page
down or pushing it up and even once you

18742
06:15:41,868 --> 06:15:41,878
down or pushing it up and even once you
 

18743
06:15:41,878 --> 06:15:43,910
down or pushing it up and even once you
get that right there's so many little

18744
06:15:43,910 --> 06:15:43,920
get that right there's so many little
 

18745
06:15:43,920 --> 06:15:46,390
get that right there's so many little
nuances of how the scroll Behavior Works

18746
06:15:46,390 --> 06:15:46,400
nuances of how the scroll Behavior Works
 

18747
06:15:46,400 --> 06:15:48,190
nuances of how the scroll Behavior Works
to make it natural and intuitive so one

18748
06:15:48,190 --> 06:15:48,200
to make it natural and intuitive so one
 

18749
06:15:48,200 --> 06:15:50,190
to make it natural and intuitive so one
example is momentum like when you scroll

18750
06:15:50,190 --> 06:15:50,200
example is momentum like when you scroll
 

18751
06:15:50,200 --> 06:15:52,070
example is momentum like when you scroll
a page with your fingers on the screen

18752
06:15:52,070 --> 06:15:52,080
a page with your fingers on the screen
 

18753
06:15:52,080 --> 06:15:53,788
a page with your fingers on the screen
you know you you actually have some like

18754
06:15:53,788 --> 06:15:53,798
you know you you actually have some like
 

18755
06:15:53,798 --> 06:15:55,190
you know you you actually have some like
flow like it doesn't just stop right

18756
06:15:55,190 --> 06:15:55,200
flow like it doesn't just stop right
 

18757
06:15:55,200 --> 06:15:57,030
flow like it doesn't just stop right
when you lift your finger up the same is

18758
06:15:57,030 --> 06:15:57,040
when you lift your finger up the same is
 

18759
06:15:57,040 --> 06:15:59,030
when you lift your finger up the same is
true with BCI scroll so we had to spend

18760
06:15:59,030 --> 06:15:59,040
true with BCI scroll so we had to spend
 

18761
06:15:59,040 --> 06:16:00,150
true with BCI scroll so we had to spend
some time to figure out what are the

18762
06:16:00,150 --> 06:16:00,160
some time to figure out what are the
 

18763
06:16:00,160 --> 06:16:01,510
some time to figure out what are the
right nuances when you don't feel the

18764
06:16:01,510 --> 06:16:01,520
right nuances when you don't feel the
 

18765
06:16:01,520 --> 06:16:03,350
right nuances when you don't feel the
screen under your fingertip anymore what

18766
06:16:03,350 --> 06:16:03,360
screen under your fingertip anymore what
 

18767
06:16:03,360 --> 06:16:05,030
screen under your fingertip anymore what
is the right sort of dynamic or what's

18768
06:16:05,030 --> 06:16:05,040
is the right sort of dynamic or what's
 

18769
06:16:05,040 --> 06:16:07,510
is the right sort of dynamic or what's
the right amount of page give if you

18770
06:16:07,510 --> 06:16:07,520
the right amount of page give if you
 

18771
06:16:07,520 --> 06:16:09,990
the right amount of page give if you
will uh when you push it to make it flow

18772
06:16:09,990 --> 06:16:10,000
will uh when you push it to make it flow
 

18773
06:16:10,000 --> 06:16:12,030
will uh when you push it to make it flow
the right amount for the user to have uh

18774
06:16:12,030 --> 06:16:12,040
the right amount for the user to have uh
 

18775
06:16:12,040 --> 06:16:14,390
the right amount for the user to have uh
a natural experience reading their book

18776
06:16:14,390 --> 06:16:14,400
a natural experience reading their book
 

18777
06:16:14,400 --> 06:16:15,548
a natural experience reading their book
and there's a million I mean there's I

18778
06:16:15,548 --> 06:16:15,558
and there's a million I mean there's I
 

18779
06:16:15,558 --> 06:16:17,070
and there's a million I mean there's I
could tell you like there's so many

18780
06:16:17,070 --> 06:16:17,080
could tell you like there's so many
 

18781
06:16:17,080 --> 06:16:18,868
could tell you like there's so many
little minua of how exactly that scroll

18782
06:16:18,868 --> 06:16:18,878
little minua of how exactly that scroll
 

18783
06:16:18,878 --> 06:16:21,110
little minua of how exactly that scroll
works that we spent probably like uh a

18784
06:16:21,110 --> 06:16:21,120
works that we spent probably like uh a
 

18785
06:16:21,120 --> 06:16:22,708
works that we spent probably like uh a
month getting right to make that feel

18786
06:16:22,708 --> 06:16:22,718
month getting right to make that feel
 

18787
06:16:22,718 --> 06:16:24,750
month getting right to make that feel
extremely natural and uh and easy for

18788
06:16:24,750 --> 06:16:24,760
extremely natural and uh and easy for
 

18789
06:16:24,760 --> 06:16:26,030
extremely natural and uh and easy for
the user to navigate I mean even the

18790
06:16:26,030 --> 06:16:26,040
the user to navigate I mean even the
 

18791
06:16:26,040 --> 06:16:29,190
the user to navigate I mean even the
scroll on a smartphone with your finger

18792
06:16:29,190 --> 06:16:29,200
scroll on a smartphone with your finger
 

18793
06:16:29,200 --> 06:16:33,350
scroll on a smartphone with your finger
feels extremely natural and pleasant

18794
06:16:33,350 --> 06:16:33,360
feels extremely natural and pleasant
 

18795
06:16:33,360 --> 06:16:36,830
feels extremely natural and pleasant
and it probably takes a extremely long

18796
06:16:36,830 --> 06:16:36,840
and it probably takes a extremely long
 

18797
06:16:36,840 --> 06:16:39,350
and it probably takes a extremely long
time to get that right and actually the

18798
06:16:39,350 --> 06:16:39,360
time to get that right and actually the
 

18799
06:16:39,360 --> 06:16:41,110
time to get that right and actually the
same kind of

18800
06:16:41,110 --> 06:16:41,120
same kind of
 

18801
06:16:41,120 --> 06:16:43,548
same kind of
visionary uh ux design that we were

18802
06:16:43,548 --> 06:16:43,558
visionary uh ux design that we were
 

18803
06:16:43,558 --> 06:16:45,310
visionary uh ux design that we were
talking about don't always listen to the

18804
06:16:45,310 --> 06:16:45,320
talking about don't always listen to the
 

18805
06:16:45,320 --> 06:16:47,910
talking about don't always listen to the
users but also listen to them and also

18806
06:16:47,910 --> 06:16:47,920
users but also listen to them and also
 

18807
06:16:47,920 --> 06:16:49,868
users but also listen to them and also
have like Visionary big like throw

18808
06:16:49,868 --> 06:16:49,878
have like Visionary big like throw
 

18809
06:16:49,878 --> 06:16:51,110
have like Visionary big like throw
everything out think from first

18810
06:16:51,110 --> 06:16:51,120
everything out think from first
 

18811
06:16:51,120 --> 06:16:54,990
everything out think from first
principles but also not yeah yeah by the

18812
06:16:54,990 --> 06:16:55,000
principles but also not yeah yeah by the
 

18813
06:16:55,000 --> 06:16:56,750
principles but also not yeah yeah by the
way it just makes me think that scroll

18814
06:16:56,750 --> 06:16:56,760
way it just makes me think that scroll
 

18815
06:16:56,760 --> 06:16:58,110
way it just makes me think that scroll
bars on the

18816
06:16:58,110 --> 06:16:58,120
bars on the
 

18817
06:16:58,120 --> 06:17:01,070
bars on the
desktop probably have stagnated and

18818
06:17:01,070 --> 06:17:01,080
desktop probably have stagnated and
 

18819
06:17:01,080 --> 06:17:03,670
desktop probably have stagnated and
never taken that like cuz uh the snap

18820
06:17:03,670 --> 06:17:03,680
never taken that like cuz uh the snap
 

18821
06:17:03,680 --> 06:17:06,468
never taken that like cuz uh the snap
same as like Snap gri snap to scroll bar

18822
06:17:06,468 --> 06:17:06,478
same as like Snap gri snap to scroll bar
 

18823
06:17:06,478 --> 06:17:08,430
same as like Snap gri snap to scroll bar
action you're talking about is something

18824
06:17:08,430 --> 06:17:08,440
action you're talking about is something
 

18825
06:17:08,440 --> 06:17:10,868
action you're talking about is something
that could potentially be extremely

18826
06:17:10,868 --> 06:17:10,878
that could potentially be extremely
 

18827
06:17:10,878 --> 06:17:13,310
that could potentially be extremely
useful in the desktop setting y even

18828
06:17:13,310 --> 06:17:13,320
useful in the desktop setting y even
 

18829
06:17:13,320 --> 06:17:15,990
useful in the desktop setting y even
just for users to just improve the

18830
06:17:15,990 --> 06:17:16,000
just for users to just improve the
 

18831
06:17:16,000 --> 06:17:17,310
just for users to just improve the
experience because the current scroll

18832
06:17:17,310 --> 06:17:17,320
experience because the current scroll
 

18833
06:17:17,320 --> 06:17:19,270
experience because the current scroll
bar experience in the desktop is

18834
06:17:19,270 --> 06:17:19,280
bar experience in the desktop is
 

18835
06:17:19,280 --> 06:17:21,750
bar experience in the desktop is
horrible y it's hard to find hard to

18836
06:17:21,750 --> 06:17:21,760
horrible y it's hard to find hard to
 

18837
06:17:21,760 --> 06:17:24,510
horrible y it's hard to find hard to
control there's not a momentum there's

18838
06:17:24,510 --> 06:17:24,520
control there's not a momentum there's
 

18839
06:17:24,520 --> 06:17:26,390
control there's not a momentum there's
uh and the intention should be clear

18840
06:17:26,390 --> 06:17:26,400
uh and the intention should be clear
 

18841
06:17:26,400 --> 06:17:28,510
uh and the intention should be clear
when I start moving towards a scroll bar

18842
06:17:28,510 --> 06:17:28,520
when I start moving towards a scroll bar
 

18843
06:17:28,520 --> 06:17:30,190
when I start moving towards a scroll bar
there should be a snaping to the scroll

18844
06:17:30,190 --> 06:17:30,200
there should be a snaping to the scroll
 

18845
06:17:30,200 --> 06:17:33,910
there should be a snaping to the scroll
bar action but of course you know uh

18846
06:17:33,910 --> 06:17:33,920
bar action but of course you know uh
 

18847
06:17:33,920 --> 06:17:36,390
bar action but of course you know uh
maybe I'm I'm okay paying that cost but

18848
06:17:36,390 --> 06:17:36,400
maybe I'm I'm okay paying that cost but
 

18849
06:17:36,400 --> 06:17:38,548
maybe I'm I'm okay paying that cost but
there's hundreds of millions of people

18850
06:17:38,548 --> 06:17:38,558
there's hundreds of millions of people
 

18851
06:17:38,558 --> 06:17:41,430
there's hundreds of millions of people
paying that cost non-stop but anyway uh

18852
06:17:41,430 --> 06:17:41,440
paying that cost non-stop but anyway uh
 

18853
06:17:41,440 --> 06:17:43,868
paying that cost non-stop but anyway uh
but in this case this is necessary

18854
06:17:43,868 --> 06:17:43,878
but in this case this is necessary
 

18855
06:17:43,878 --> 06:17:46,750
but in this case this is necessary
because there's an extra cost paid by

18856
06:17:46,750 --> 06:17:46,760
because there's an extra cost paid by
 

18857
06:17:46,760 --> 06:17:49,310
because there's an extra cost paid by
Nolan for the jittering this so you have

18858
06:17:49,310 --> 06:17:49,320
Nolan for the jittering this so you have
 

18859
06:17:49,320 --> 06:17:52,310
Nolan for the jittering this so you have
to switch between the scrolling and the

18860
06:17:52,310 --> 06:17:52,320
to switch between the scrolling and the
 

18861
06:17:52,320 --> 06:17:54,708
to switch between the scrolling and the
reading there has to be a phase shift

18862
06:17:54,708 --> 06:17:54,718
reading there has to be a phase shift
 

18863
06:17:54,718 --> 06:17:57,430
reading there has to be a phase shift
between the two like when you're

18864
06:17:57,430 --> 06:17:57,440
between the two like when you're
 

18865
06:17:57,440 --> 06:17:59,270
between the two like when you're
scrolling you're scrolling right right

18866
06:17:59,270 --> 06:17:59,280
scrolling you're scrolling right right
 

18867
06:17:59,280 --> 06:18:00,750
scrolling you're scrolling right right
so that is one drawback of the current

18868
06:18:00,750 --> 06:18:00,760
so that is one drawback of the current
 

18869
06:18:00,760 --> 06:18:02,590
so that is one drawback of the current
the current approach um maybe one other

18870
06:18:02,590 --> 06:18:02,600
the current approach um maybe one other
 

18871
06:18:02,600 --> 06:18:05,110
the current approach um maybe one other
just sort of case study here so again ux

18872
06:18:05,110 --> 06:18:05,120
just sort of case study here so again ux
 

18873
06:18:05,120 --> 06:18:06,708
just sort of case study here so again ux
is how it works and we think about that

18874
06:18:06,708 --> 06:18:06,718
is how it works and we think about that
 

18875
06:18:06,718 --> 06:18:08,548
is how it works and we think about that
holistically from like the even the

18876
06:18:08,548 --> 06:18:08,558
holistically from like the even the
 

18877
06:18:08,558 --> 06:18:09,670
holistically from like the even the
feuture detection level of what we

18878
06:18:09,670 --> 06:18:09,680
feuture detection level of what we
 

18879
06:18:09,680 --> 06:18:11,230
feuture detection level of what we
detect in the brain to how we design the

18880
06:18:11,230 --> 06:18:11,240
detect in the brain to how we design the
 

18881
06:18:11,240 --> 06:18:13,190
detect in the brain to how we design the
decoder what we choose to decode to then

18882
06:18:13,190 --> 06:18:13,200
decoder what we choose to decode to then
 

18883
06:18:13,200 --> 06:18:14,548
decoder what we choose to decode to then
how it works once it's being used by the

18884
06:18:14,548 --> 06:18:14,558
how it works once it's being used by the
 

18885
06:18:14,558 --> 06:18:16,070
how it works once it's being used by the
user so another good example in the sort

18886
06:18:16,070 --> 06:18:16,080
user so another good example in the sort
 

18887
06:18:16,080 --> 06:18:17,468
user so another good example in the sort
of how it works once they're actually

18888
06:18:17,468 --> 06:18:17,478
of how it works once they're actually
 

18889
06:18:17,478 --> 06:18:19,708
of how it works once they're actually
using the decoder uh you know the output

18890
06:18:19,708 --> 06:18:19,718
using the decoder uh you know the output
 

18891
06:18:19,718 --> 06:18:20,948
using the decoder uh you know the output
that's displayed on the screen is not

18892
06:18:20,948 --> 06:18:20,958
that's displayed on the screen is not
 

18893
06:18:20,958 --> 06:18:22,468
that's displayed on the screen is not
just what the decoder says it's also a

18894
06:18:22,468 --> 06:18:22,478
just what the decoder says it's also a
 

18895
06:18:22,478 --> 06:18:24,390
just what the decoder says it's also a
function of uh you know what's going on

18896
06:18:24,390 --> 06:18:24,400
function of uh you know what's going on
 

18897
06:18:24,400 --> 06:18:25,990
function of uh you know what's going on
on the screen so we can understand for

18898
06:18:25,990 --> 06:18:26,000
on the screen so we can understand for
 

18899
06:18:26,000 --> 06:18:27,670
on the screen so we can understand for
example that you know when you're trying

18900
06:18:27,670 --> 06:18:27,680
example that you know when you're trying
 

18901
06:18:27,680 --> 06:18:30,270
example that you know when you're trying
to close a tab that very small stupid

18902
06:18:30,270 --> 06:18:30,280
to close a tab that very small stupid
 

18903
06:18:30,280 --> 06:18:32,310
to close a tab that very small stupid
little X that's extremely tiny which is

18904
06:18:32,310 --> 06:18:32,320
little X that's extremely tiny which is
 

18905
06:18:32,320 --> 06:18:34,910
little X that's extremely tiny which is
hard to get precisely hit if you're deal

18906
06:18:34,910 --> 06:18:34,920
hard to get precisely hit if you're deal
 

18907
06:18:34,920 --> 06:18:35,910
hard to get precisely hit if you're deal
with sort of a noisy output of the

18908
06:18:35,910 --> 06:18:35,920
with sort of a noisy output of the
 

18909
06:18:35,920 --> 06:18:37,708
with sort of a noisy output of the
decoder we can understand that that is a

18910
06:18:37,708 --> 06:18:37,718
decoder we can understand that that is a
 

18911
06:18:37,718 --> 06:18:38,868
decoder we can understand that that is a
small little X you might be trying to

18912
06:18:38,868 --> 06:18:38,878
small little X you might be trying to
 

18913
06:18:38,878 --> 06:18:40,350
small little X you might be trying to
hit and actually make it a bigger Target

18914
06:18:40,350 --> 06:18:40,360
hit and actually make it a bigger Target
 

18915
06:18:40,360 --> 06:18:41,628
hit and actually make it a bigger Target
for you similar to how when you're

18916
06:18:41,628 --> 06:18:41,638
for you similar to how when you're
 

18917
06:18:41,638 --> 06:18:44,468
for you similar to how when you're
typing on your phone if you're uh you

18918
06:18:44,468 --> 06:18:44,478
typing on your phone if you're uh you
 

18919
06:18:44,478 --> 06:18:45,990
typing on your phone if you're uh you
know used to like the iOS keyboard for

18920
06:18:45,990 --> 06:18:46,000
know used to like the iOS keyboard for
 

18921
06:18:46,000 --> 06:18:47,548
know used to like the iOS keyboard for
example it actually adapts the target

18922
06:18:47,548 --> 06:18:47,558
example it actually adapts the target
 

18923
06:18:47,558 --> 06:18:49,468
example it actually adapts the target
size of individual keys based on an

18924
06:18:49,468 --> 06:18:49,478
size of individual keys based on an
 

18925
06:18:49,478 --> 06:18:50,628
size of individual keys based on an
underlying language model so it'll

18926
06:18:50,628 --> 06:18:50,638
underlying language model so it'll
 

18927
06:18:50,638 --> 06:18:52,390
underlying language model so it'll
actually understand that if I'm typing

18928
06:18:52,390 --> 06:18:52,400
actually understand that if I'm typing
 

18929
06:18:52,400 --> 06:18:54,110
actually understand that if I'm typing
hey I'm going to see

18930
06:18:54,110 --> 06:18:54,120
hey I'm going to see
 

18931
06:18:54,120 --> 06:18:56,430
hey I'm going to see
L it'll make the E key bigger because it

18932
06:18:56,430 --> 06:18:56,440
L it'll make the E key bigger because it
 

18933
06:18:56,440 --> 06:18:57,708
L it'll make the E key bigger because it
knows Lex is the person I'm going to go

18934
06:18:57,708 --> 06:18:57,718
knows Lex is the person I'm going to go
 

18935
06:18:57,718 --> 06:18:59,510
knows Lex is the person I'm going to go
see and so that kind of you know

18936
06:18:59,510 --> 06:18:59,520
see and so that kind of you know
 

18937
06:18:59,520 --> 06:19:01,190
see and so that kind of you know
predictiveness can make the experience

18938
06:19:01,190 --> 06:19:01,200
predictiveness can make the experience
 

18939
06:19:01,200 --> 06:19:03,070
predictiveness can make the experience
much more smooth even without you know

18940
06:19:03,070 --> 06:19:03,080
much more smooth even without you know
 

18941
06:19:03,080 --> 06:19:04,468
much more smooth even without you know
improvements to the underlying decoder

18942
06:19:04,468 --> 06:19:04,478
improvements to the underlying decoder
 

18943
06:19:04,478 --> 06:19:05,548
improvements to the underlying decoder
or

18944
06:19:05,548 --> 06:19:05,558
or
 

18945
06:19:05,558 --> 06:19:07,150
or
uh or feature detection part of the

18946
06:19:07,150 --> 06:19:07,160
uh or feature detection part of the
 

18947
06:19:07,160 --> 06:19:08,590
uh or feature detection part of the
stack so we do that with a feature

18948
06:19:08,590 --> 06:19:08,600
stack so we do that with a feature
 

18949
06:19:08,600 --> 06:19:09,788
stack so we do that with a feature
called magnetic targets we actually

18950
06:19:09,788 --> 06:19:09,798
called magnetic targets we actually
 

18951
06:19:09,798 --> 06:19:11,788
called magnetic targets we actually
index the screen and we understand okay

18952
06:19:11,788 --> 06:19:11,798
index the screen and we understand okay
 

18953
06:19:11,798 --> 06:19:13,390
index the screen and we understand okay
these are the places that are you know

18954
06:19:13,390 --> 06:19:13,400
these are the places that are you know
 

18955
06:19:13,400 --> 06:19:14,788
these are the places that are you know
very small targets might be difficult to

18956
06:19:14,788 --> 06:19:14,798
very small targets might be difficult to
 

18957
06:19:14,798 --> 06:19:16,788
very small targets might be difficult to
hit here's the kind of cursor Dynamics

18958
06:19:16,788 --> 06:19:16,798
hit here's the kind of cursor Dynamics
 

18959
06:19:16,798 --> 06:19:18,070
hit here's the kind of cursor Dynamics
around that location that might be

18960
06:19:18,070 --> 06:19:18,080
around that location that might be
 

18961
06:19:18,080 --> 06:19:19,468
around that location that might be
indicative of the user trying to select

18962
06:19:19,468 --> 06:19:19,478
indicative of the user trying to select
 

18963
06:19:19,478 --> 06:19:21,310
indicative of the user trying to select
it let's make it easier let's blow up

18964
06:19:21,310 --> 06:19:21,320
it let's make it easier let's blow up
 

18965
06:19:21,320 --> 06:19:22,430
it let's make it easier let's blow up
the size of it in a way that makes it

18966
06:19:22,430 --> 06:19:22,440
the size of it in a way that makes it
 

18967
06:19:22,440 --> 06:19:23,788
the size of it in a way that makes it
easier for the user to sort of snap onto

18968
06:19:23,788 --> 06:19:23,798
easier for the user to sort of snap onto
 

18969
06:19:23,798 --> 06:19:25,510
easier for the user to sort of snap onto
that Target so all these little details

18970
06:19:25,510 --> 06:19:25,520
that Target so all these little details
 

18971
06:19:25,520 --> 06:19:26,990
that Target so all these little details
they matter a lot in helping the user be

18972
06:19:26,990 --> 06:19:27,000
they matter a lot in helping the user be
 

18973
06:19:27,000 --> 06:19:29,070
they matter a lot in helping the user be
independent in their day-to-day living

18974
06:19:29,070 --> 06:19:29,080
independent in their day-to-day living
 

18975
06:19:29,080 --> 06:19:31,310
independent in their day-to-day living
so how much of the work on the decoder

18976
06:19:31,310 --> 06:19:31,320
so how much of the work on the decoder
 

18977
06:19:31,320 --> 06:19:35,788
so how much of the work on the decoder
is generalizable to P2 P3 P4 P5

18978
06:19:35,788 --> 06:19:35,798
is generalizable to P2 P3 P4 P5
 

18979
06:19:35,798 --> 06:19:38,910
is generalizable to P2 P3 P4 P5
PN H how do you improve the decoder in a

18980
06:19:38,910 --> 06:19:38,920
PN H how do you improve the decoder in a
 

18981
06:19:38,920 --> 06:19:39,910
PN H how do you improve the decoder in a
way that's

18982
06:19:39,910 --> 06:19:39,920
way that's
 

18983
06:19:39,920 --> 06:19:42,230
way that's
generalizable yeah great question so the

18984
06:19:42,230 --> 06:19:42,240
generalizable yeah great question so the
 

18985
06:19:42,240 --> 06:19:43,830
generalizable yeah great question so the
underlying uh signal we're trying to

18986
06:19:43,830 --> 06:19:43,840
underlying uh signal we're trying to
 

18987
06:19:43,840 --> 06:19:45,030
underlying uh signal we're trying to
decode is going to look very different

18988
06:19:45,030 --> 06:19:45,040
decode is going to look very different
 

18989
06:19:45,040 --> 06:19:46,910
decode is going to look very different
in P2 than in P1 for example channel

18990
06:19:46,910 --> 06:19:46,920
in P2 than in P1 for example channel
 

18991
06:19:46,920 --> 06:19:49,430
in P2 than in P1 for example channel
number 345 is going to mean something

18992
06:19:49,430 --> 06:19:49,440
number 345 is going to mean something
 

18993
06:19:49,440 --> 06:19:50,868
number 345 is going to mean something
different in user one than it will user

18994
06:19:50,868 --> 06:19:50,878
different in user one than it will user
 

18995
06:19:50,878 --> 06:19:52,430
different in user one than it will user
two just because that electrode that

18996
06:19:52,430 --> 06:19:52,440
two just because that electrode that
 

18997
06:19:52,440 --> 06:19:53,990
two just because that electrode that
corresponds with Channel 345 is going to

18998
06:19:53,990 --> 06:19:54,000
corresponds with Channel 345 is going to
 

18999
06:19:54,000 --> 06:19:55,990
corresponds with Channel 345 is going to
be in next to a different neuron in user

19000
06:19:55,990 --> 06:19:56,000
be in next to a different neuron in user
 

19001
06:19:56,000 --> 06:19:58,468
be in next to a different neuron in user
one versus user two but the approaches

19002
06:19:58,468 --> 06:19:58,478
one versus user two but the approaches
 

19003
06:19:58,478 --> 06:20:00,190
one versus user two but the approaches
the methods the user experience of how

19004
06:20:00,190 --> 06:20:00,200
the methods the user experience of how
 

19005
06:20:00,200 --> 06:20:02,070
the methods the user experience of how
do you get the right sort of behavioral

19006
06:20:02,070 --> 06:20:02,080
do you get the right sort of behavioral
 

19007
06:20:02,080 --> 06:20:03,788
do you get the right sort of behavioral
pattern from the user to associate with

19008
06:20:03,788 --> 06:20:03,798
pattern from the user to associate with
 

19009
06:20:03,798 --> 06:20:05,430
pattern from the user to associate with
that neural signal we hoped it will

19010
06:20:05,430 --> 06:20:05,440
that neural signal we hoped it will
 

19011
06:20:05,440 --> 06:20:07,670
that neural signal we hoped it will
translate over over multiple generations

19012
06:20:07,670 --> 06:20:07,680
translate over over multiple generations
 

19013
06:20:07,680 --> 06:20:09,548
translate over over multiple generations
of users and beyond that it's very very

19014
06:20:09,548 --> 06:20:09,558
of users and beyond that it's very very
 

19015
06:20:09,558 --> 06:20:10,948
of users and beyond that it's very very
possible in fact quite likely that we've

19016
06:20:10,948 --> 06:20:10,958
possible in fact quite likely that we've
 

19017
06:20:10,958 --> 06:20:13,390
possible in fact quite likely that we've
overfit to sort of Nolan user experience

19018
06:20:13,390 --> 06:20:13,400
overfit to sort of Nolan user experience
 

19019
06:20:13,400 --> 06:20:15,310
overfit to sort of Nolan user experience
desires and preferences and so what I

19020
06:20:15,310 --> 06:20:15,320
desires and preferences and so what I
 

19021
06:20:15,320 --> 06:20:17,430
desires and preferences and so what I
hope to see is that uh you know when we

19022
06:20:17,430 --> 06:20:17,440
hope to see is that uh you know when we
 

19023
06:20:17,440 --> 06:20:19,708
hope to see is that uh you know when we
get a second third fourth participant

19024
06:20:19,708 --> 06:20:19,718
get a second third fourth participant
 

19025
06:20:19,718 --> 06:20:21,270
get a second third fourth participant
that we find sort of what the right wide

19026
06:20:21,270 --> 06:20:21,280
that we find sort of what the right wide
 

19027
06:20:21,280 --> 06:20:23,110
that we find sort of what the right wide
minimas are that cover all the cases

19028
06:20:23,110 --> 06:20:23,120
minimas are that cover all the cases
 

19029
06:20:23,120 --> 06:20:24,350
minimas are that cover all the cases
that make it more intuitive for everyone

19030
06:20:24,350 --> 06:20:24,360
that make it more intuitive for everyone
 

19031
06:20:24,360 --> 06:20:24,910
that make it more intuitive for everyone
and hopefully there's a

19032
06:20:24,910 --> 06:20:24,920
and hopefully there's a
 

19033
06:20:24,920 --> 06:20:26,788
and hopefully there's a
cross-pollination of things where oh we

19034
06:20:26,788 --> 06:20:26,798
cross-pollination of things where oh we
 

19035
06:20:26,798 --> 06:20:28,150
cross-pollination of things where oh we
didn't think about that with this user

19036
06:20:28,150 --> 06:20:28,160
didn't think about that with this user
 

19037
06:20:28,160 --> 06:20:30,548
didn't think about that with this user
because you know they can speak but with

19038
06:20:30,548 --> 06:20:30,558
because you know they can speak but with
 

19039
06:20:30,558 --> 06:20:32,150
because you know they can speak but with
this user who just can fundamentally not

19040
06:20:32,150 --> 06:20:32,160
this user who just can fundamentally not
 

19041
06:20:32,160 --> 06:20:34,150
this user who just can fundamentally not
speak at all this user experience is not

19042
06:20:34,150 --> 06:20:34,160
speak at all this user experience is not
 

19043
06:20:34,160 --> 06:20:35,548
speak at all this user experience is not
optimal and that will actually those

19044
06:20:35,548 --> 06:20:35,558
optimal and that will actually those
 

19045
06:20:35,558 --> 06:20:37,030
optimal and that will actually those
improvements that we make there should

19046
06:20:37,030 --> 06:20:37,040
improvements that we make there should
 

19047
06:20:37,040 --> 06:20:38,230
improvements that we make there should
hopefully translate then to even people

19048
06:20:38,230 --> 06:20:38,240
hopefully translate then to even people
 

19049
06:20:38,240 --> 06:20:39,590
hopefully translate then to even people
who can speak but don't feel comfortable

19050
06:20:39,590 --> 06:20:39,600
who can speak but don't feel comfortable
 

19051
06:20:39,600 --> 06:20:40,910
who can speak but don't feel comfortable
doing so because they're in a public

19052
06:20:40,910 --> 06:20:40,920
doing so because they're in a public
 

19053
06:20:40,920 --> 06:20:42,830
doing so because they're in a public
setting like their doctor's office so

19054
06:20:42,830 --> 06:20:42,840
setting like their doctor's office so
 

19055
06:20:42,840 --> 06:20:45,750
setting like their doctor's office so
the the actual mechanism of open loop

19056
06:20:45,750 --> 06:20:45,760
the the actual mechanism of open loop
 

19057
06:20:45,760 --> 06:20:48,430
the the actual mechanism of open loop
labeling and then closed loop labeling

19058
06:20:48,430 --> 06:20:48,440
labeling and then closed loop labeling
 

19059
06:20:48,440 --> 06:20:51,070
labeling and then closed loop labeling
would be the same and hopefully can

19060
06:20:51,070 --> 06:20:51,080
would be the same and hopefully can
 

19061
06:20:51,080 --> 06:20:52,948
would be the same and hopefully can
generalize across the different users as

19062
06:20:52,948 --> 06:20:52,958
generalize across the different users as
 

19063
06:20:52,958 --> 06:20:55,830
generalize across the different users as
they're doing the calibration

19064
06:20:55,830 --> 06:20:55,840
they're doing the calibration
 

19065
06:20:55,840 --> 06:20:58,468
they're doing the calibration
step and the calibration step is pretty

19066
06:20:58,468 --> 06:20:58,478
step and the calibration step is pretty
 

19067
06:20:58,478 --> 06:21:00,788
step and the calibration step is pretty
cool I mean that in itself the the

19068
06:21:00,788 --> 06:21:00,798
cool I mean that in itself the the
 

19069
06:21:00,798 --> 06:21:02,468
cool I mean that in itself the the
interesting thing about web grid which

19070
06:21:02,468 --> 06:21:02,478
interesting thing about web grid which
 

19071
06:21:02,478 --> 06:21:05,510
interesting thing about web grid which
is like Clos loop it's like

19072
06:21:05,510 --> 06:21:05,520
is like Clos loop it's like
 

19073
06:21:05,520 --> 06:21:07,990
is like Clos loop it's like
I love it when there's like uh there

19074
06:21:07,990 --> 06:21:08,000
I love it when there's like uh there
 

19075
06:21:08,000 --> 06:21:09,548
I love it when there's like uh there
used to be kind of an idea of human

19076
06:21:09,548 --> 06:21:09,558
used to be kind of an idea of human
 

19077
06:21:09,558 --> 06:21:12,270
used to be kind of an idea of human
computation which is using actions that

19078
06:21:12,270 --> 06:21:12,280
computation which is using actions that
 

19079
06:21:12,280 --> 06:21:14,150
computation which is using actions that
human would want to do anyway to get a

19080
06:21:14,150 --> 06:21:14,160
human would want to do anyway to get a
 

19081
06:21:14,160 --> 06:21:16,110
human would want to do anyway to get a
lot of signal from yeah and like webg

19082
06:21:16,110 --> 06:21:16,120
lot of signal from yeah and like webg
 

19083
06:21:16,120 --> 06:21:17,868
lot of signal from yeah and like webg
great is that like a nice video game

19084
06:21:17,868 --> 06:21:17,878
great is that like a nice video game
 

19085
06:21:17,878 --> 06:21:20,270
great is that like a nice video game
that also serves as great calibration

19086
06:21:20,270 --> 06:21:20,280
that also serves as great calibration
 

19087
06:21:20,280 --> 06:21:21,830
that also serves as great calibration
it's so funny this is I've heard this

19088
06:21:21,830 --> 06:21:21,840
it's so funny this is I've heard this
 

19089
06:21:21,840 --> 06:21:24,350
it's so funny this is I've heard this
reaction so many times before sort of

19090
06:21:24,350 --> 06:21:24,360
reaction so many times before sort of
 

19091
06:21:24,360 --> 06:21:27,150
reaction so many times before sort of
the you know first user was implanted we

19092
06:21:27,150 --> 06:21:27,160
the you know first user was implanted we
 

19093
06:21:27,160 --> 06:21:28,468
the you know first user was implanted we
had an internal perception that the

19094
06:21:28,468 --> 06:21:28,478
had an internal perception that the
 

19095
06:21:28,478 --> 06:21:30,230
had an internal perception that the
first user would not find this fun yeah

19096
06:21:30,230 --> 06:21:30,240
first user would not find this fun yeah
 

19097
06:21:30,240 --> 06:21:31,510
first user would not find this fun yeah
and so we thought really quite a bit

19098
06:21:31,510 --> 06:21:31,520
and so we thought really quite a bit
 

19099
06:21:31,520 --> 06:21:32,628
and so we thought really quite a bit
actually about like should we build

19100
06:21:32,628 --> 06:21:32,638
actually about like should we build
 

19101
06:21:32,638 --> 06:21:34,868
actually about like should we build
other games that like are more

19102
06:21:34,868 --> 06:21:34,878
other games that like are more
 

19103
06:21:34,878 --> 06:21:36,070
other games that like are more
interesting for the user so we can get

19104
06:21:36,070 --> 06:21:36,080
interesting for the user so we can get
 

19105
06:21:36,080 --> 06:21:37,708
interesting for the user so we can get
this kind of data and help facilitate

19106
06:21:37,708 --> 06:21:37,718
this kind of data and help facilitate
 

19107
06:21:37,718 --> 06:21:39,390
this kind of data and help facilitate
research that's you know for long

19108
06:21:39,390 --> 06:21:39,400
research that's you know for long
 

19109
06:21:39,400 --> 06:21:40,750
research that's you know for long
durations stuff like this turns out that

19110
06:21:40,750 --> 06:21:40,760
durations stuff like this turns out that
 

19111
06:21:40,760 --> 06:21:42,430
durations stuff like this turns out that
like people love this game yeah I always

19112
06:21:42,430 --> 06:21:42,440
like people love this game yeah I always
 

19113
06:21:42,440 --> 06:21:43,628
like people love this game yeah I always
loved it but I didn't know that that was

19114
06:21:43,628 --> 06:21:43,638
loved it but I didn't know that that was
 

19115
06:21:43,638 --> 06:21:44,788
loved it but I didn't know that that was
a shared

19116
06:21:44,788 --> 06:21:44,798
a shared
 

19117
06:21:44,798 --> 06:21:47,230
a shared
perception yeah just in case it's not

19118
06:21:47,230 --> 06:21:47,240
perception yeah just in case it's not
 

19119
06:21:47,240 --> 06:21:51,510
perception yeah just in case it's not
clear web grid is there's a a grid of

19120
06:21:51,510 --> 06:21:51,520
clear web grid is there's a a grid of
 

19121
06:21:51,520 --> 06:21:53,190
clear web grid is there's a a grid of
let's say 35 by

19122
06:21:53,190 --> 06:21:53,200
let's say 35 by
 

19123
06:21:53,200 --> 06:21:56,030
let's say 35 by
35 uh cells and one of them lights up

19124
06:21:56,030 --> 06:21:56,040
35 uh cells and one of them lights up
 

19125
06:21:56,040 --> 06:21:57,230
35 uh cells and one of them lights up
blue and you have to move your mouse

19126
06:21:57,230 --> 06:21:57,240
blue and you have to move your mouse
 

19127
06:21:57,240 --> 06:21:59,150
blue and you have to move your mouse
over that and click on it and if you

19128
06:21:59,150 --> 06:21:59,160
over that and click on it and if you
 

19129
06:21:59,160 --> 06:22:01,708
over that and click on it and if you
miss it and it's red and I play this

19130
06:22:01,708 --> 06:22:01,718
miss it and it's red and I play this
 

19131
06:22:01,718 --> 06:22:04,510
miss it and it's red and I play this
game for so many hours so many hours and

19132
06:22:04,510 --> 06:22:04,520
game for so many hours so many hours and
 

19133
06:22:04,520 --> 06:22:07,070
game for so many hours so many hours and
what's your record you said my I think I

19134
06:22:07,070 --> 06:22:07,080
what's your record you said my I think I
 

19135
06:22:07,080 --> 06:22:08,468
what's your record you said my I think I
have the highest at nurlink right now my

19136
06:22:08,468 --> 06:22:08,478
have the highest at nurlink right now my
 

19137
06:22:08,478 --> 06:22:11,270
have the highest at nurlink right now my
record is 17 BPS 17 BPS which about if

19138
06:22:11,270 --> 06:22:11,280
record is 17 BPS 17 BPS which about if
 

19139
06:22:11,280 --> 06:22:13,110
record is 17 BPS 17 BPS which about if
you imagine that 35 by 35 grid you're

19140
06:22:13,110 --> 06:22:13,120
you imagine that 35 by 35 grid you're
 

19141
06:22:13,120 --> 06:22:16,150
you imagine that 35 by 35 grid you're
hitting about 100 trials per minute so

19142
06:22:16,150 --> 06:22:16,160
hitting about 100 trials per minute so
 

19143
06:22:16,160 --> 06:22:17,468
hitting about 100 trials per minute so
100 correct Selections in that one

19144
06:22:17,468 --> 06:22:17,478
100 correct Selections in that one
 

19145
06:22:17,478 --> 06:22:19,350
100 correct Selections in that one
minute window so you're averaging about

19146
06:22:19,350 --> 06:22:19,360
minute window so you're averaging about
 

19147
06:22:19,360 --> 06:22:21,030
minute window so you're averaging about
you know between 500 600 milliseconds

19148
06:22:21,030 --> 06:22:21,040
you know between 500 600 milliseconds
 

19149
06:22:21,040 --> 06:22:23,390
you know between 500 600 milliseconds
per selection so one one of the reasons

19150
06:22:23,390 --> 06:22:23,400
per selection so one one of the reasons
 

19151
06:22:23,400 --> 06:22:25,830
per selection so one one of the reasons
I think I struggle with that game is I'm

19152
06:22:25,830 --> 06:22:25,840
I think I struggle with that game is I'm
 

19153
06:22:25,840 --> 06:22:27,708
I think I struggle with that game is I'm
such a keyboard person so everything is

19154
06:22:27,708 --> 06:22:27,718
such a keyboard person so everything is
 

19155
06:22:27,718 --> 06:22:30,430
such a keyboard person so everything is
done with via keyboard if if I can avoid

19156
06:22:30,430 --> 06:22:30,440
done with via keyboard if if I can avoid
 

19157
06:22:30,440 --> 06:22:33,750
done with via keyboard if if I can avoid
touching the mouse it's great so how can

19158
06:22:33,750 --> 06:22:33,760
touching the mouse it's great so how can
 

19159
06:22:33,760 --> 06:22:35,190
touching the mouse it's great so how can
you explain your h

19160
06:22:35,190 --> 06:22:35,200
you explain your h
 

19161
06:22:35,200 --> 06:22:37,270
you explain your h
performance I have like a whole ritual I

19162
06:22:37,270 --> 06:22:37,280
performance I have like a whole ritual I
 

19163
06:22:37,280 --> 06:22:39,350
performance I have like a whole ritual I
go through when I play web GD so it's

19164
06:22:39,350 --> 06:22:39,360
go through when I play web GD so it's
 

19165
06:22:39,360 --> 06:22:40,788
go through when I play web GD so it's
ESS actually like a diet plan associated

19166
06:22:40,788 --> 06:22:40,798
ESS actually like a diet plan associated
 

19167
06:22:40,798 --> 06:22:43,150
ESS actually like a diet plan associated
with this like it's a whole thing so the

19168
06:22:43,150 --> 06:22:43,160
with this like it's a whole thing so the
 

19169
06:22:43,160 --> 06:22:45,110
with this like it's a whole thing so the
first I have to fast for 5 days I have

19170

first I have to fast for 5 days I have
to go up to the mountain actually it

19172
06:22:46,510 --> 06:22:46,520
to go up to the mountain actually it
 

19173
06:22:46,520 --> 06:22:47,868
to go up to the mountain actually it
kind I mean the fasting thing is

19174
06:22:47,868 --> 06:22:47,878
kind I mean the fasting thing is
 

19175
06:22:47,878 --> 06:22:49,590
kind I mean the fasting thing is
important so this is like you know focus

19176
06:22:49,590 --> 06:22:49,600
important so this is like you know focus
 

19177
06:22:49,600 --> 06:22:51,830
important so this is like you know focus
is the mind yeah it's true so what I do

19178
06:22:51,830 --> 06:22:51,840
is the mind yeah it's true so what I do
 

19179
06:22:51,840 --> 06:22:54,030
is the mind yeah it's true so what I do
is I I actually I don't eat for a little

19180
06:22:54,030 --> 06:22:54,040
is I I actually I don't eat for a little
 

19181
06:22:54,040 --> 06:22:55,948
is I I actually I don't eat for a little
bit beforehand and then I'll actually

19182
06:22:55,948 --> 06:22:55,958
bit beforehand and then I'll actually
 

19183
06:22:55,958 --> 06:22:57,350
bit beforehand and then I'll actually
eat like a ton of peanut butter right

19184
06:22:57,350 --> 06:22:57,360
eat like a ton of peanut butter right
 

19185
06:22:57,360 --> 06:22:59,190
eat like a ton of peanut butter right
before I play and I get this is a real

19186
06:22:59,190 --> 06:22:59,200
before I play and I get this is a real
 

19187
06:22:59,200 --> 06:23:00,750
before I play and I get this is a real
thing this is a real thing yeah and then

19196
06:23:07,390 --> 06:23:07,400
midnight 2: a.m. kind of time window and
 

19197
06:23:07,400 --> 06:23:09,150
midnight 2: a.m. kind of time window and
I have a very specific like physical

19198
06:23:09,150 --> 06:23:09,160
I have a very specific like physical
 

19199
06:23:09,160 --> 06:23:11,708
I have a very specific like physical
position I'll sit in which is uh I used

19200
06:23:11,708 --> 06:23:11,718
position I'll sit in which is uh I used
 

19201
06:23:11,718 --> 06:23:12,990
position I'll sit in which is uh I used
to be I was homeschooled growing up and

19202
06:23:12,990 --> 06:23:13,000
to be I was homeschooled growing up and
 

19203
06:23:13,000 --> 06:23:14,230
to be I was homeschooled growing up and
so I did most of my work like on the

19204
06:23:14,230 --> 06:23:14,240
so I did most of my work like on the
 

19205
06:23:14,240 --> 06:23:16,070
so I did most of my work like on the
floor uh just like in my bedroom or

19206
06:23:16,070 --> 06:23:16,080
floor uh just like in my bedroom or
 

19207
06:23:16,080 --> 06:23:17,910
floor uh just like in my bedroom or
whatever and so I have a very specific

19208
06:23:17,910 --> 06:23:17,920
whatever and so I have a very specific
 

19209
06:23:17,920 --> 06:23:19,708
whatever and so I have a very specific
situation on the floor on the floor that

19210
06:23:19,708 --> 06:23:19,718
situation on the floor on the floor that
 

19211
06:23:19,718 --> 06:23:21,868
situation on the floor on the floor that
I sit and play and then you have to make

19212
06:23:21,868 --> 06:23:21,878
I sit and play and then you have to make
 

19213
06:23:21,878 --> 06:23:23,030
I sit and play and then you have to make
sure like there's not a lot of weight on

19214
06:23:23,030 --> 06:23:23,040
sure like there's not a lot of weight on
 

19215
06:23:23,040 --> 06:23:24,310
sure like there's not a lot of weight on
your elbow when you're playing so you

19216
06:23:24,310 --> 06:23:24,320
your elbow when you're playing so you
 

19217
06:23:24,320 --> 06:23:25,948
your elbow when you're playing so you
can move quickly and then I turn the

19218
06:23:25,948 --> 06:23:25,958
can move quickly and then I turn the
 

19219
06:23:25,958 --> 06:23:27,190
can move quickly and then I turn the
gain of the cursor so the speed of the

19220
06:23:27,190 --> 06:23:27,200
gain of the cursor so the speed of the
 

19221
06:23:27,200 --> 06:23:28,590
gain of the cursor so the speed of the
cursor way way up so it's like small

19222
06:23:28,590 --> 06:23:28,600
cursor way way up so it's like small
 

19223
06:23:28,600 --> 06:23:29,948
cursor way way up so it's like small
motions that actually move the cursor

19224
06:23:29,948 --> 06:23:29,958
motions that actually move the cursor
 

19225
06:23:29,958 --> 06:23:31,910
motions that actually move the cursor
are you moving with your wrist or you

19226
06:23:31,910 --> 06:23:31,920
are you moving with your wrist or you
 

19227
06:23:31,920 --> 06:23:34,230
are you moving with your wrist or you
you never I move with my fingers so I my

19228
06:23:34,230 --> 06:23:34,240
you never I move with my fingers so I my
 

19229
06:23:34,240 --> 06:23:35,628
you never I move with my fingers so I my
wrist is almost completely still I'm

19230
06:23:35,628 --> 06:23:35,638
wrist is almost completely still I'm
 

19231
06:23:35,638 --> 06:23:38,150
wrist is almost completely still I'm
just moving my fingers yeah you know

19232
06:23:38,150 --> 06:23:38,160
just moving my fingers yeah you know
 

19233
06:23:38,160 --> 06:23:40,590
just moving my fingers yeah you know
those just in a small tangent yeah the

19234
06:23:40,590 --> 06:23:40,600
those just in a small tangent yeah the
 

19235
06:23:40,600 --> 06:23:42,788
those just in a small tangent yeah the
which I've been meaning to go down this

19236
06:23:42,788 --> 06:23:42,798
which I've been meaning to go down this
 

19237
06:23:42,798 --> 06:23:45,390
which I've been meaning to go down this
Rabbit Hole of people that um set the

19238
06:23:45,390 --> 06:23:45,400
Rabbit Hole of people that um set the
 

19239
06:23:45,400 --> 06:23:47,670
Rabbit Hole of people that um set the
world record in Tetris those folks

19240
06:23:47,670 --> 06:23:47,680
world record in Tetris those folks
 

19241
06:23:47,680 --> 06:23:49,070
world record in Tetris those folks
they're playing there's a there's a way

19242
06:23:49,070 --> 06:23:49,080
they're playing there's a there's a way
 

19243
06:23:49,080 --> 06:23:51,510
they're playing there's a there's a way
to did you see this seen like the like

19244
06:23:51,510 --> 06:23:51,520
to did you see this seen like the like
 

19245
06:23:51,520 --> 06:23:53,350
to did you see this seen like the like
all the fingers are moving yeah you you

19246
06:23:53,350 --> 06:23:53,360
all the fingers are moving yeah you you
 

19247
06:23:53,360 --> 06:23:55,948
all the fingers are moving yeah you you
could you could find a way to do it

19248
06:23:55,948 --> 06:23:55,958
could you could find a way to do it
 

19249
06:23:55,958 --> 06:23:58,468
could you could find a way to do it
where like it's using a loophole like a

19250
06:23:58,468 --> 06:23:58,478
where like it's using a loophole like a
 

19251
06:23:58,478 --> 06:24:00,948
where like it's using a loophole like a
bug that you can do some incredibly fast

19252
06:24:00,948 --> 06:24:00,958
bug that you can do some incredibly fast
 

19253
06:24:00,958 --> 06:24:03,270
bug that you can do some incredibly fast
stuff so it's it's along that line but

19254
06:24:03,270 --> 06:24:03,280
stuff so it's it's along that line but
 

19255
06:24:03,280 --> 06:24:05,390
stuff so it's it's along that line but
not quite but you do realize there'll be

19256
06:24:05,390 --> 06:24:05,400
not quite but you do realize there'll be
 

19257
06:24:05,400 --> 06:24:06,788
not quite but you do realize there'll be
like a few programmers right now

19258
06:24:06,788 --> 06:24:06,798
like a few programmers right now
 

19259
06:24:06,798 --> 06:24:08,430
like a few programmers right now
listening to this who fast and eat

19260
06:24:08,430 --> 06:24:08,440
listening to this who fast and eat
 

19261
06:24:08,440 --> 06:24:10,150
listening to this who fast and eat
peanut butter please please break my

19262
06:24:10,150 --> 06:24:10,160
peanut butter please please break my
 

19263
06:24:10,160 --> 06:24:11,628
peanut butter please please break my
record I mean the reason I did this

19264
06:24:11,628 --> 06:24:11,638
record I mean the reason I did this
 

19265
06:24:11,638 --> 06:24:13,110
record I mean the reason I did this
literally was just because I wanted the

19266
06:24:13,110 --> 06:24:13,120
literally was just because I wanted the
 

19267
06:24:13,120 --> 06:24:14,548
literally was just because I wanted the
bar to be high for the team like I

19268
06:24:14,548 --> 06:24:14,558
bar to be high for the team like I
 

19269
06:24:14,558 --> 06:24:16,390
bar to be high for the team like I
wanted the the number that we aim for

19270
06:24:16,390 --> 06:24:16,400
wanted the the number that we aim for
 

19271
06:24:16,400 --> 06:24:17,310
wanted the the number that we aim for
should not be like the median

19272
06:24:17,310 --> 06:24:17,320
should not be like the median
 

19273
06:24:17,320 --> 06:24:18,310
should not be like the median
performance it should be like it should

19274
06:24:18,310 --> 06:24:18,320
performance it should be like it should
 

19275
06:24:18,320 --> 06:24:19,868
performance it should be like it should
be able to beat all of us at least like

19276
06:24:19,868 --> 06:24:19,878
be able to beat all of us at least like
 

19277
06:24:19,878 --> 06:24:21,468
be able to beat all of us at least like
that should be the minimum bar what do

19278
06:24:21,468 --> 06:24:21,478
that should be the minimum bar what do
 

19279
06:24:21,478 --> 06:24:23,548
that should be the minimum bar what do
you think is possible like 20 yeah I

19280
06:24:23,548 --> 06:24:23,558
you think is possible like 20 yeah I
 

19281
06:24:23,558 --> 06:24:24,510
you think is possible like 20 yeah I
don't know what the limits I mean the

19282
06:24:24,510 --> 06:24:24,520
don't know what the limits I mean the
 

19283
06:24:24,520 --> 06:24:26,190
don't know what the limits I mean the
limits you can calculate just in terms

19284
06:24:26,190 --> 06:24:26,200
limits you can calculate just in terms
 

19285
06:24:26,200 --> 06:24:28,830
limits you can calculate just in terms
of like screen refresh rate and like

19286
06:24:28,830 --> 06:24:28,840
of like screen refresh rate and like
 

19287
06:24:28,840 --> 06:24:30,190
of like screen refresh rate and like
cursor immediately jump into the next

19288
06:24:30,190 --> 06:24:30,200
cursor immediately jump into the next
 

19289
06:24:30,200 --> 06:24:31,750
cursor immediately jump into the next
Target but there's I mean I'm sure

19290
06:24:31,750 --> 06:24:31,760
Target but there's I mean I'm sure
 

19291
06:24:31,760 --> 06:24:33,110
Target but there's I mean I'm sure
there's limits before that with just

19292
06:24:33,110 --> 06:24:33,120
there's limits before that with just
 

19293
06:24:33,120 --> 06:24:34,390
there's limits before that with just
sort of reaction time and visual

19294
06:24:34,390 --> 06:24:34,400
sort of reaction time and visual
 

19295
06:24:34,400 --> 06:24:36,788
sort of reaction time and visual
perception and things like this um I'd

19296
06:24:36,788 --> 06:24:36,798
perception and things like this um I'd
 

19297
06:24:36,798 --> 06:24:39,590
perception and things like this um I'd
guess it's in the below 40 but above 20

19298
06:24:39,590 --> 06:24:39,600
guess it's in the below 40 but above 20
 

19299
06:24:39,600 --> 06:24:40,868
guess it's in the below 40 but above 20
somewhere in there it's probably the

19300
06:24:40,868 --> 06:24:40,878
somewhere in there it's probably the
 

19301
06:24:40,878 --> 06:24:42,070
somewhere in there it's probably the
right the right number to be thinking

19302
06:24:42,070 --> 06:24:42,080
right the right number to be thinking
 

19303
06:24:42,080 --> 06:24:43,468
right the right number to be thinking
about it also matters like how difficult

19304
06:24:43,468 --> 06:24:43,478
about it also matters like how difficult
 

19305
06:24:43,478 --> 06:24:45,548
about it also matters like how difficult
the task is you could imagine like some

19306
06:24:45,548 --> 06:24:45,558
the task is you could imagine like some
 

19307
06:24:45,558 --> 06:24:47,310
the task is you could imagine like some
people might be able to do like 10,000

19308
06:24:47,310 --> 06:24:47,320
people might be able to do like 10,000
 

19309
06:24:47,320 --> 06:24:48,708
people might be able to do like 10,000
Targets on the screen and maybe they can

19310
06:24:48,708 --> 06:24:48,718
Targets on the screen and maybe they can
 

19311
06:24:48,718 --> 06:24:51,628
Targets on the screen and maybe they can
do better that way um so there's some

19312
06:24:51,628 --> 06:24:51,638
do better that way um so there's some
 

19313
06:24:51,638 --> 06:24:53,110
do better that way um so there's some
like task optimizations you could do to

19314
06:24:53,110 --> 06:24:53,120
like task optimizations you could do to
 

19315
06:24:53,120 --> 06:24:55,548
like task optimizations you could do to
try to boost your performance as well

19316
06:24:55,548 --> 06:24:55,558
try to boost your performance as well
 

19317
06:24:55,558 --> 06:24:57,750
try to boost your performance as well
what uh do you think it takes for Nolan

19318
06:24:57,750 --> 06:24:57,760
what uh do you think it takes for Nolan
 

19319
06:24:57,760 --> 06:25:00,548
what uh do you think it takes for Nolan
to be able to do above 85 to keep

19320
06:25:00,548 --> 06:25:00,558
to be able to do above 85 to keep
 

19321
06:25:00,558 --> 06:25:02,430
to be able to do above 85 to keep
increasing that number you said like

19322
06:25:02,430 --> 06:25:02,440
increasing that number you said like
 

19323
06:25:02,440 --> 06:25:04,830
increasing that number you said like
every increase in the number might

19324
06:25:04,830 --> 06:25:04,840
every increase in the number might
 

19325
06:25:04,840 --> 06:25:07,510
every increase in the number might
require different yeah different

19326
06:25:07,510 --> 06:25:07,520
require different yeah different
 

19327
06:25:07,520 --> 06:25:09,670
require different yeah different
improvements in the system yeah I think

19328
06:25:09,670 --> 06:25:09,680
improvements in the system yeah I think
 

19329
06:25:09,680 --> 06:25:11,070
improvements in the system yeah I think
the nature of this work is I the first

19330
06:25:11,070 --> 06:25:11,080
the nature of this work is I the first
 

19331
06:25:11,080 --> 06:25:12,110
the nature of this work is I the first
the first answer that's important to say

19332
06:25:12,110 --> 06:25:12,120
the first answer that's important to say
 

19333
06:25:12,120 --> 06:25:14,628
the first answer that's important to say
is I don't know um this is you know edge

19334
06:25:14,628 --> 06:25:14,638
is I don't know um this is you know edge
 

19335
06:25:14,638 --> 06:25:17,548
is I don't know um this is you know edge
of the research so again nobody's gotten

19336
06:25:17,548 --> 06:25:17,558
of the research so again nobody's gotten
 

19337
06:25:17,558 --> 06:25:19,708
of the research so again nobody's gotten
to that number before so what's next is

19338
06:25:19,708 --> 06:25:19,718
to that number before so what's next is
 

19339
06:25:19,718 --> 06:25:21,910
to that number before so what's next is
going to be a you know heris a guess

19340
06:25:21,910 --> 06:25:21,920
going to be a you know heris a guess
 

19341
06:25:21,920 --> 06:25:25,070
going to be a you know heris a guess
from my part um what we've seen

19342
06:25:25,070 --> 06:25:25,080
from my part um what we've seen
 

19343
06:25:25,080 --> 06:25:26,830
from my part um what we've seen
historically is that different parts of

19344
06:25:26,830 --> 06:25:26,840
historically is that different parts of
 

19345
06:25:26,840 --> 06:25:27,990
historically is that different parts of
the staff come bottlenecks at different

19346
06:25:27,990 --> 06:25:28,000
the staff come bottlenecks at different
 

19347
06:25:28,000 --> 06:25:29,628
the staff come bottlenecks at different
time points so you know when I first

19348
06:25:29,628 --> 06:25:29,638
time points so you know when I first
 

19349
06:25:29,638 --> 06:25:31,590
time points so you know when I first
joined nlink like three years ago or so

19350
06:25:31,590 --> 06:25:31,600
joined nlink like three years ago or so
 

19351
06:25:31,600 --> 06:25:32,948
joined nlink like three years ago or so
one of the major problems was just the

19352
06:25:32,948 --> 06:25:32,958
one of the major problems was just the
 

19353
06:25:32,958 --> 06:25:34,350
one of the major problems was just the
latency of the Bluetooth connection it

19354
06:25:34,350 --> 06:25:34,360
latency of the Bluetooth connection it
 

19355
06:25:34,360 --> 06:25:36,070
latency of the Bluetooth connection it
was just like the radio on the device

19356
06:25:36,070 --> 06:25:36,080
was just like the radio on the device
 

19357
06:25:36,080 --> 06:25:37,190
was just like the radio on the device
wasn't super good it was an earlier

19358
06:25:37,190 --> 06:25:37,200
wasn't super good it was an earlier
 

19359
06:25:37,200 --> 06:25:39,510
wasn't super good it was an earlier
rision of the implant and uh it just

19360
06:25:39,510 --> 06:25:39,520
rision of the implant and uh it just
 

19361
06:25:39,520 --> 06:25:40,948
rision of the implant and uh it just
like no matter how good your decoder was

19362
06:25:40,948 --> 06:25:40,958
like no matter how good your decoder was
 

19363
06:25:40,958 --> 06:25:42,350
like no matter how good your decoder was
if your thing is updating every 30

19364
06:25:42,350 --> 06:25:42,360
if your thing is updating every 30
 

19365
06:25:42,360 --> 06:25:43,628
if your thing is updating every 30
milliseconds or 50 milliseconds it's

19366
06:25:43,628 --> 06:25:43,638
milliseconds or 50 milliseconds it's
 

19367
06:25:43,638 --> 06:25:45,868
milliseconds or 50 milliseconds it's
just going to be choppy and uh no matter

19368
06:25:45,868 --> 06:25:45,878
just going to be choppy and uh no matter
 

19369
06:25:45,878 --> 06:25:47,070
just going to be choppy and uh no matter
how good you are that's going to be

19370
06:25:47,070 --> 06:25:47,080
how good you are that's going to be
 

19371
06:25:47,080 --> 06:25:49,628
how good you are that's going to be
frustrating and lead to uh challenges so

19372
06:25:49,628 --> 06:25:49,638
frustrating and lead to uh challenges so
 

19373
06:25:49,638 --> 06:25:50,948
frustrating and lead to uh challenges so
you know at that point it was very clear

19374
06:25:50,948 --> 06:25:50,958
you know at that point it was very clear
 

19375
06:25:50,958 --> 06:25:52,670
you know at that point it was very clear
that the main challenge is just get the

19376
06:25:52,670 --> 06:25:52,680
that the main challenge is just get the
 

19377
06:25:52,680 --> 06:25:55,430
that the main challenge is just get the
data off the device in a very reliable

19378
06:25:55,430 --> 06:25:55,440
data off the device in a very reliable
 

19379
06:25:55,440 --> 06:25:57,150
data off the device in a very reliable
way such that you can enable the next

19380
06:25:57,150 --> 06:25:57,160
way such that you can enable the next
 

19381
06:25:57,160 --> 06:25:59,788
way such that you can enable the next
challenge to be to be tackled and then

19382
06:25:59,788 --> 06:25:59,798
challenge to be to be tackled and then
 

19383
06:25:59,798 --> 06:26:02,788
challenge to be to be tackled and then
you know at some point it was um you

19384
06:26:02,788 --> 06:26:02,798
you know at some point it was um you
 

19385
06:26:02,798 --> 06:26:04,030
you know at some point it was um you
know actually the modeling challenge of

19386
06:26:04,030 --> 06:26:04,040
know actually the modeling challenge of
 

19387
06:26:04,040 --> 06:26:06,670
know actually the modeling challenge of
how do you uh just build a good mapping

19388
06:26:06,670 --> 06:26:06,680
how do you uh just build a good mapping
 

19389
06:26:06,680 --> 06:26:08,190
how do you uh just build a good mapping
like the supervised learning problem of

19390
06:26:08,190 --> 06:26:08,200
like the supervised learning problem of
 

19391
06:26:08,200 --> 06:26:10,110
like the supervised learning problem of
you have a bunch of data and you have a

19392
06:26:10,110 --> 06:26:10,120
you have a bunch of data and you have a
 

19393
06:26:10,120 --> 06:26:11,750
you have a bunch of data and you have a
label you're trying to predict just what

19394
06:26:11,750 --> 06:26:11,760
label you're trying to predict just what
 

19395
06:26:11,760 --> 06:26:13,510
label you're trying to predict just what
is the right like neurod decoder

19396
06:26:13,510 --> 06:26:13,520
is the right like neurod decoder
 

19397
06:26:13,520 --> 06:26:14,830
is the right like neurod decoder
architecture and hyperparameters to

19398
06:26:14,830 --> 06:26:14,840
architecture and hyperparameters to
 

19399
06:26:14,840 --> 06:26:16,548
architecture and hyperparameters to
optimize that that was a problem for a

19400
06:26:16,548 --> 06:26:16,558
optimize that that was a problem for a
 

19401
06:26:16,558 --> 06:26:17,788
optimize that that was a problem for a
bit and once you solve that it became a

19402
06:26:17,788 --> 06:26:17,798
bit and once you solve that it became a
 

19403
06:26:17,798 --> 06:26:19,948
bit and once you solve that it became a
different bottleneck um I think the next

19404
06:26:19,948 --> 06:26:19,958
different bottleneck um I think the next
 

19405
06:26:19,958 --> 06:26:21,510
different bottleneck um I think the next
bottleneck after that was actually just

19406
06:26:21,510 --> 06:26:21,520
bottleneck after that was actually just
 

19407
06:26:21,520 --> 06:26:22,990
bottleneck after that was actually just
sort of software stability and

19408
06:26:22,990 --> 06:26:23,000
sort of software stability and
 

19409
06:26:23,000 --> 06:26:25,230
sort of software stability and
reliability um you know if you have

19410
06:26:25,230 --> 06:26:25,240
reliability um you know if you have
 

19411
06:26:25,240 --> 06:26:28,628
reliability um you know if you have
widely varying sort of inference latency

19412
06:26:28,628 --> 06:26:28,638
widely varying sort of inference latency
 

19413
06:26:28,638 --> 06:26:31,670
widely varying sort of inference latency
uh in your in your system or your you

19414
06:26:31,670 --> 06:26:31,680
uh in your in your system or your you
 

19415
06:26:31,680 --> 06:26:32,948
uh in your in your system or your you
know your app just lags out every once

19416
06:26:32,948 --> 06:26:32,958
know your app just lags out every once
 

19417
06:26:32,958 --> 06:26:34,548
know your app just lags out every once
in a while it decreases your ability to

19418
06:26:34,548 --> 06:26:34,558
in a while it decreases your ability to
 

19419
06:26:34,558 --> 06:26:36,030
in a while it decreases your ability to
maintain and get in a state of flow and

19420
06:26:36,030 --> 06:26:36,040
maintain and get in a state of flow and
 

19421
06:26:36,040 --> 06:26:37,510
maintain and get in a state of flow and
it basically just disrupts your control

19422
06:26:37,510 --> 06:26:37,520
it basically just disrupts your control
 

19423
06:26:37,520 --> 06:26:39,190
it basically just disrupts your control
experience and so there's a variety of

19424
06:26:39,190 --> 06:26:39,200
experience and so there's a variety of
 

19425
06:26:39,200 --> 06:26:41,190
experience and so there's a variety of
different software bugs and uh

19426
06:26:41,190 --> 06:26:41,200
different software bugs and uh
 

19427
06:26:41,200 --> 06:26:42,190
different software bugs and uh
improvements we made that basically

19428
06:26:42,190 --> 06:26:42,200
improvements we made that basically
 

19429
06:26:42,200 --> 06:26:43,750
improvements we made that basically
increased the performance of the system

19430
06:26:43,750 --> 06:26:43,760
increased the performance of the system
 

19431
06:26:43,760 --> 06:26:45,190
increased the performance of the system
made it much more reliable much more

19432
06:26:45,190 --> 06:26:45,200
made it much more reliable much more
 

19433
06:26:45,200 --> 06:26:47,270
made it much more reliable much more

19434
06:26:47,270 --> 06:26:47,280
stable and led to a state where we could
 

19435
06:26:47,280 --> 06:26:48,750
stable and led to a state where we could
reliably collect data to build better

19436
06:26:48,750 --> 06:26:48,760
reliably collect data to build better

now uh there's sort of two major

19444
06:26:57,190 --> 06:26:57,200
now uh there's sort of two major
 

19445
06:26:57,200 --> 06:26:58,270
now uh there's sort of two major
directions you could think about for

19446
06:26:58,270 --> 06:26:58,280
directions you could think about for
 

19447
06:26:58,280 --> 06:27:00,750
directions you could think about for
improving BPS further um the first major

19448
06:27:00,750 --> 06:27:00,760
improving BPS further um the first major
 

19449
06:27:00,760 --> 06:27:02,390
improving BPS further um the first major
direction is labeling so labeling is

19450
06:27:02,390 --> 06:27:02,400
direction is labeling so labeling is
 

19451
06:27:02,400 --> 06:27:04,230
direction is labeling so labeling is
again this fundamental challenge of

19452
06:27:04,230 --> 06:27:04,240
again this fundamental challenge of
 

19453
06:27:04,240 --> 06:27:06,590
again this fundamental challenge of
given uh a window of time where the user

19454
06:27:06,590 --> 06:27:06,600
given uh a window of time where the user
 

19455
06:27:06,600 --> 06:27:08,628
given uh a window of time where the user
is expressing some behavioral intent

19456
06:27:08,628 --> 06:27:08,638
is expressing some behavioral intent
 

19457
06:27:08,638 --> 06:27:10,310
is expressing some behavioral intent
what are they really trying to do at the

19458
06:27:10,310 --> 06:27:10,320
what are they really trying to do at the
 

19459
06:27:10,320 --> 06:27:11,990
what are they really trying to do at the
at the granularity of every

19460
06:27:11,990 --> 06:27:12,000
at the granularity of every
 

19461
06:27:12,000 --> 06:27:14,190
at the granularity of every
millisecond and that again is a task

19462
06:27:14,190 --> 06:27:14,200
millisecond and that again is a task
 

19463
06:27:14,200 --> 06:27:16,190
millisecond and that again is a task
design problem it's a ux problem it's a

19464
06:27:16,190 --> 06:27:16,200
design problem it's a ux problem it's a
 

19465
06:27:16,200 --> 06:27:18,030

different domains the second uh thing

19470
06:27:22,110 --> 06:27:22,120
different domains the second uh thing
 

19471
06:27:22,120 --> 06:27:23,430
different domains the second uh thing
you can think about to improve BPS

19472
06:27:23,430 --> 06:27:23,440
you can think about to improve BPS

the thing you're decoding or just

19476
06:27:27,230 --> 06:27:27,240
the thing you're decoding or just
 

19477
06:27:27,240 --> 06:27:28,150
the thing you're decoding or just
extending the number of things that

19478
06:27:28,150 --> 06:27:28,160
extending the number of things that
 

19479
06:27:28,160 --> 06:27:29,788
extending the number of things that
you're decoding so this is serving the

06:27:29,788 --> 06:27:29,798
you're decoding so this is serving the
 

19481
06:27:29,798 --> 06:27:31,510
you're decoding so this is serving the
direction of functionality basically you

06:27:36,110 --> 06:27:36,120
middle click uh different actions like
 

19489
06:27:36,120 --> 06:27:37,788
middle click uh different actions like
click and drag for example and that can

19490
06:27:37,788 --> 06:27:37,798
click and drag for example and that can
 

19491
06:27:37,798 --> 06:27:39,190
click and drag for example and that can
improve the effective bit rate of your

19492
06:27:39,190 --> 06:27:39,200
improve the effective bit rate of your
 

19493
06:27:39,200 --> 06:27:41,030
improve the effective bit rate of your
communication prothesis if you're trying

communication prothesis if you're trying
 

19495
06:27:41,040 --> 06:27:43,070
communication prothesis if you're trying
to uh allow the user to express

06:27:43,070 --> 06:27:43,080
to uh allow the user to express
 

19497

Communication channel you can measure

19500
06:27:45,628 --> 06:27:45,638
Communication channel you can measure
 

19501
06:27:45,638 --> 06:27:47,110
Communication channel you can measure
that with bits per second but what

06:27:52,788 --> 06:27:52,798
perspective of the downstream task that
 

19511
06:27:52,798 --> 06:27:54,070
perspective of the downstream task that
you care about functionality and

you care about functionality and
 

19513
06:27:54,080 --> 06:27:55,030
you care about functionality and
extending functionality is something

19514
06:27:55,030 --> 06:27:55,040
extending functionality is something
 

19515
06:27:55,040 --> 06:27:56,150
extending functionality is something

only can It improve the sort of number

19518
06:27:57,830 --> 06:27:57,840
only can It improve the sort of number
 

19519
06:27:57,840 --> 06:27:59,788
only can It improve the sort of number
of BPS but it can also improve the

19520
06:27:59,788 --> 06:27:59,798
of BPS but it can also improve the
 

19521
06:27:59,798 --> 06:28:01,548
of BPS but it can also improve the
downstream sort of Independence that the

19522
06:28:01,548 --> 06:28:01,558
downstream sort of Independence that the
 

19523
06:28:01,558 --> 06:28:02,868
downstream sort of Independence that the
user has and the skill and efficiency

19524
06:28:02,868 --> 06:28:02,878
user has and the skill and efficiency
 

19525
06:28:02,878 --> 06:28:03,788
user has and the skill and efficiency
with which they can operate their

would the number of threads increasing

19530
06:28:08,590 --> 06:28:08,600
would the number of threads increasing
 

19531
06:28:08,600 --> 06:28:11,548
would the number of threads increasing
also potentially help yes short answer

19532
06:28:11,548 --> 06:28:11,558
also potentially help yes short answer
 

19533
06:28:11,558 --> 06:28:14,750
also potentially help yes short answer
is yes it's a bit nuanced how that curve

19534
06:28:14,750 --> 06:28:14,760
is yes it's a bit nuanced how that curve
 

19535
06:28:14,760 --> 06:28:18,590
is yes it's a bit nuanced how that curve
uh or how that manifests in uh in the

19536
06:28:18,590 --> 06:28:18,600
uh or how that manifests in uh in the
 

19537
06:28:18,600 --> 06:28:20,948
uh or how that manifests in uh in the
numbers so what you'll see is that if

19538
06:28:20,948 --> 06:28:20,958
numbers so what you'll see is that if
 

19539
06:28:20,958 --> 06:28:23,548
numbers so what you'll see is that if
you sort of plot a curve of number of

06:28:23,548 --> 06:28:23,558
you sort of plot a curve of number of
 

19541
06:28:23,558 --> 06:28:26,070
you sort of plot a curve of number of

further out in number of channels you
 

19555
06:28:39,600 --> 06:28:41,070
further out in number of channels you
get a corresponding sort of logarithmic

19556
06:28:41,070 --> 06:28:41,080
get a corresponding sort of logarithmic
 

19557

06:29:12,760 --> 06:29:14,548
actually like if you had a bunch of
different imagine movements you could do

19590
06:29:14,548 --> 06:29:14,558
different imagine movements you could do
 

19591
06:29:14,558 --> 06:29:15,590
different imagine movements you could do
how would you map those imagine

19592
06:29:15,590 --> 06:29:15,600
how would you map those imagine
 

19593
06:29:15,600 --> 06:29:17,910
how would you map those imagine
movements to input to a computer uh you

19594
06:29:17,910 --> 06:29:17,920
movements to input to a computer uh you
 

19595
06:29:17,920 --> 06:29:19,310
movements to input to a computer uh you
could imagine you know handwriting to

19596
06:29:19,310 --> 06:29:19,320
could imagine you know handwriting to
 

19597
06:29:19,320 --> 06:29:20,468
could imagine you know handwriting to
Output characters on the screen you

19598
06:29:20,468 --> 06:29:20,478
Output characters on the screen you
 

19599
06:29:20,478 --> 06:29:21,548
Output characters on the screen you
could imagine just typing with your

19600
06:29:21,548 --> 06:29:21,558
could imagine just typing with your
 

19601
06:29:21,558 --> 06:29:22,910
could imagine just typing with your
fingers and have that output text on the

19602
06:29:22,910 --> 06:29:22,920
fingers and have that output text on the
 

19603
06:29:22,920 --> 06:29:24,230
fingers and have that output text on the
screen you could imagine Different

19604
06:29:24,230 --> 06:29:24,240
screen you could imagine Different
 

19605
06:29:24,240 --> 06:29:25,468
screen you could imagine Different
Finger modulations for different clicks

19606
06:29:25,468 --> 06:29:25,478
Finger modulations for different clicks
 

19607
06:29:25,478 --> 06:29:26,788
Finger modulations for different clicks
you could imagine wiggling your big nose

19608
06:29:26,788 --> 06:29:26,798
you could imagine wiggling your big nose
 

19609
06:29:26,798 --> 06:29:28,910
you could imagine wiggling your big nose
for uh opening some some menu or

19610
06:29:28,910 --> 06:29:28,920
for uh opening some some menu or
 

19611
06:29:28,920 --> 06:29:31,150
for uh opening some some menu or
wiggling your you know your big toe to

19612
06:29:31,150 --> 06:29:31,160
wiggling your you know your big toe to
 

19613
06:29:31,160 --> 06:29:33,350
wiggling your you know your big toe to
have like command tab occur or something

19614
06:29:33,350 --> 06:29:33,360
have like command tab occur or something
 

19615
06:29:33,360 --> 06:29:35,670
have like command tab occur or something
like this so it's really uh the amount

19616
06:29:35,670 --> 06:29:35,680
like this so it's really uh the amount
 

19617
06:29:35,680 --> 06:29:37,030
like this so it's really uh the amount
of different actions you can take in the

19618
06:29:37,030 --> 06:29:37,040
of different actions you can take in the
 

19619
06:29:37,040 --> 06:29:38,708
of different actions you can take in the
world depends on how many channels you

19620
06:29:38,708 --> 06:29:38,718
world depends on how many channels you
 

19621
06:29:38,718 --> 06:29:39,830
world depends on how many channels you
have and the information content that

19622
06:29:39,830 --> 06:29:39,840
have and the information content that
 

19623
06:29:39,840 --> 06:29:41,070
have and the information content that
they

19624
06:29:41,070 --> 06:29:41,080
they
 

19625
06:29:41,080 --> 06:29:43,430
they
carry all right so that's more about the

19626
06:29:43,430 --> 06:29:43,440
carry all right so that's more about the
 

19627
06:29:43,440 --> 06:29:44,990
carry all right so that's more about the
number of actions so actually as you

19628
06:29:44,990 --> 06:29:45,000
number of actions so actually as you
 

19629
06:29:45,000 --> 06:29:46,868
number of actions so actually as you
increase the number of threads that's

19630
06:29:46,868 --> 06:29:46,878
increase the number of threads that's
 

19631
06:29:46,878 --> 06:29:47,708
increase the number of threads that's
more

19632
06:29:47,708 --> 06:29:47,718
more
 

19633
06:29:47,718 --> 06:29:50,510
more
about increasing uh the number of

19634
06:29:50,510 --> 06:29:50,520
about increasing uh the number of
 

19635
06:29:50,520 --> 06:29:52,310
about increasing uh the number of
actions you're able to perform one other

19636
06:29:52,310 --> 06:29:52,320
actions you're able to perform one other
 

19637
06:29:52,320 --> 06:29:53,910
actions you're able to perform one other
Nuance there that is worth mentioning so

19638
06:29:53,910 --> 06:29:53,920
Nuance there that is worth mentioning so
 

19639
06:29:53,920 --> 06:29:55,110
Nuance there that is worth mentioning so
again our goal is really to enable a

19640
06:29:55,110 --> 06:29:55,120
again our goal is really to enable a
 

19641
06:29:55,120 --> 06:29:56,390
again our goal is really to enable a
user with paralysis to control the

19642
06:29:56,390 --> 06:29:56,400
user with paralysis to control the
 

19643
06:29:56,400 --> 06:29:59,150
user with paralysis to control the
computer as fast as I can so that's BPS

19644
06:29:59,150 --> 06:29:59,160
computer as fast as I can so that's BPS
 

19645
06:29:59,160 --> 06:30:00,628
computer as fast as I can so that's BPS
uh with all the same functionality I

19646
06:30:00,628 --> 06:30:00,638
uh with all the same functionality I
 

19647
06:30:00,638 --> 06:30:01,788
uh with all the same functionality I
have which is what we just talked about

19648
06:30:01,788 --> 06:30:01,798
have which is what we just talked about
 

19649
06:30:01,798 --> 06:30:04,110
have which is what we just talked about
but then also as reliably as I can yeah

19650
06:30:04,110 --> 06:30:04,120
but then also as reliably as I can yeah
 

19651
06:30:04,120 --> 06:30:06,628
but then also as reliably as I can yeah
and that last point is very related to

19652
06:30:06,628 --> 06:30:06,638
and that last point is very related to
 

19653
06:30:06,638 --> 06:30:08,750
and that last point is very related to
channel count discussion so as you scale

19654
06:30:08,750 --> 06:30:08,760
channel count discussion so as you scale
 

19655
06:30:08,760 --> 06:30:10,910
channel count discussion so as you scale
out number of channels the relative

19656
06:30:10,910 --> 06:30:10,920
out number of channels the relative
 

19657
06:30:10,920 --> 06:30:12,750
out number of channels the relative
importance of any particular feature of

19658
06:30:12,750 --> 06:30:12,760
importance of any particular feature of
 

19659
06:30:12,760 --> 06:30:14,510
importance of any particular feature of
your model input to the output control

19660
06:30:14,510 --> 06:30:14,520
your model input to the output control
 

19661
06:30:14,520 --> 06:30:16,750
your model input to the output control
of the user diminishes which means that

19662
06:30:16,750 --> 06:30:16,760
of the user diminishes which means that
 

19663
06:30:16,760 --> 06:30:18,750
of the user diminishes which means that
if the sort of neural nonstationarity

19664
06:30:18,750 --> 06:30:18,760
if the sort of neural nonstationarity
 

19665
06:30:18,760 --> 06:30:21,670
if the sort of neural nonstationarity
effect is per Channel or if the noise is

19666
06:30:21,670 --> 06:30:21,680
effect is per Channel or if the noise is
 

19667
06:30:21,680 --> 06:30:23,150
effect is per Channel or if the noise is
independent such that more channels

19668
06:30:23,150 --> 06:30:23,160
independent such that more channels
 

19669
06:30:23,160 --> 06:30:26,070
independent such that more channels
means on average less output effect then

19670
06:30:26,070 --> 06:30:26,080
means on average less output effect then
 

19671
06:30:26,080 --> 06:30:27,548
means on average less output effect then
your reliability of your system will

19672
06:30:27,548 --> 06:30:27,558
your reliability of your system will
 

19673
06:30:27,558 --> 06:30:30,548
your reliability of your system will
improve so one sort of core thesis um

19674
06:30:30,548 --> 06:30:30,558
improve so one sort of core thesis um
 

19675
06:30:30,558 --> 06:30:31,628
improve so one sort of core thesis um
that at least I have is that scaling

19676
06:30:31,628 --> 06:30:31,638
that at least I have is that scaling
 

19677
06:30:31,638 --> 06:30:32,708
that at least I have is that scaling
Channel count should improve the

19678
06:30:32,708 --> 06:30:32,718
Channel count should improve the
 

19679
06:30:32,718 --> 06:30:34,430
Channel count should improve the
reliability system without any

19680
06:30:34,430 --> 06:30:34,440
reliability system without any
 

19681
06:30:34,440 --> 06:30:37,590
reliability system without any
work on the decoder itself can you

19682
06:30:37,590 --> 06:30:37,600
work on the decoder itself can you
 

19683
06:30:37,600 --> 06:30:40,388
work on the decoder itself can you
Linger on the reliability here so first

19684
06:30:40,388 --> 06:30:40,398
Linger on the reliability here so first
 

19685
06:30:40,398 --> 06:30:42,468
Linger on the reliability here so first
of all when you say nonstationarity of

19686
06:30:42,468 --> 06:30:42,478
of all when you say nonstationarity of
 

19687
06:30:42,478 --> 06:30:45,430
of all when you say nonstationarity of
the signal which aspect are you

19688
06:30:45,430 --> 06:30:45,440
the signal which aspect are you
 

19689
06:30:45,440 --> 06:30:47,430
the signal which aspect are you
referring to yeah so maybe let's talk

19690
06:30:47,430 --> 06:30:47,440
referring to yeah so maybe let's talk
 

19691
06:30:47,440 --> 06:30:48,670
referring to yeah so maybe let's talk
briefly what the actual underlying

19692
06:30:48,670 --> 06:30:48,680
briefly what the actual underlying
 

19693
06:30:48,680 --> 06:30:50,388
briefly what the actual underlying
signal looks like so again I I spoke

19694
06:30:50,388 --> 06:30:50,398
signal looks like so again I I spoke
 

19695
06:30:50,398 --> 06:30:52,150
signal looks like so again I I spoke
very briefly at the beginning about how

19696
06:30:52,150 --> 06:30:52,160
very briefly at the beginning about how
 

19697
06:30:52,160 --> 06:30:53,430
very briefly at the beginning about how
when you imagine moving to the right or

19698
06:30:53,430 --> 06:30:53,440
when you imagine moving to the right or
 

19699
06:30:53,440 --> 06:30:55,190
when you imagine moving to the right or
imagine moving to the left neurons might

19700
06:30:55,190 --> 06:30:55,200
imagine moving to the left neurons might
 

19701
06:30:55,200 --> 06:30:56,708
imagine moving to the left neurons might
fire more or less and their frequency

19702
06:30:56,708 --> 06:30:56,718
fire more or less and their frequency
 

19703
06:30:56,718 --> 06:30:58,270
fire more or less and their frequency
content of that signal at least in the

19704
06:30:58,270 --> 06:30:58,280
content of that signal at least in the
 

19705
06:30:58,280 --> 06:31:00,070
content of that signal at least in the
motor cortex it's very correlated with

19706
06:31:00,070 --> 06:31:00,080
motor cortex it's very correlated with
 

19707
06:31:00,080 --> 06:31:02,468
motor cortex it's very correlated with
the output intention the behavioral uh

19708
06:31:02,468 --> 06:31:02,478
the output intention the behavioral uh
 

19709
06:31:02,478 --> 06:31:03,868
the output intention the behavioral uh
task that the user is doing you could

19710
06:31:03,868 --> 06:31:03,878
task that the user is doing you could
 

19711
06:31:03,878 --> 06:31:04,948
task that the user is doing you could
you can imagine actually this is not

19712
06:31:04,948 --> 06:31:04,958
you can imagine actually this is not
 

19713
06:31:04,958 --> 06:31:06,270
you can imagine actually this is not
obvious that rate coding which is the

19714
06:31:06,270 --> 06:31:06,280
obvious that rate coding which is the
 

19715
06:31:06,280 --> 06:31:08,150
obvious that rate coding which is the
name of that um phenomena is like the

19716
06:31:08,150 --> 06:31:08,160
name of that um phenomena is like the
 

19717
06:31:08,160 --> 06:31:09,110
name of that um phenomena is like the
only way the brain could represent

19718
06:31:09,110 --> 06:31:09,120
only way the brain could represent
 

19719
06:31:09,120 --> 06:31:10,150
only way the brain could represent
information you can imagine many

19720
06:31:10,150 --> 06:31:10,160
information you can imagine many
 

19721
06:31:10,160 --> 06:31:11,628
information you can imagine many
different ways in which the brain could

19722
06:31:11,628 --> 06:31:11,638
different ways in which the brain could
 

19723
06:31:11,638 --> 06:31:13,830
different ways in which the brain could
encode uh intention and there's actually

19724
06:31:13,830 --> 06:31:13,840
encode uh intention and there's actually
 

19725
06:31:13,840 --> 06:31:15,788
encode uh intention and there's actually
evidence like in bats for example that

19726
06:31:15,788 --> 06:31:15,798
evidence like in bats for example that
 

19727
06:31:15,798 --> 06:31:17,590
evidence like in bats for example that
there's temporal codes so timing codes

19728
06:31:17,590 --> 06:31:17,600
there's temporal codes so timing codes
 

19729
06:31:17,600 --> 06:31:19,350
there's temporal codes so timing codes
of like exactly when particular neurons

19730
06:31:19,350 --> 06:31:19,360
of like exactly when particular neurons
 

19731
06:31:19,360 --> 06:31:22,750
of like exactly when particular neurons
fire is the the mechanism of information

19732
06:31:22,750 --> 06:31:22,760
fire is the the mechanism of information
 

19733
06:31:22,760 --> 06:31:24,388
fire is the the mechanism of information
uh representation but at least in the

19734
06:31:24,388 --> 06:31:24,398
uh representation but at least in the
 

19735
06:31:24,398 --> 06:31:25,910
uh representation but at least in the
motor cortex there's substantial

19736
06:31:25,910 --> 06:31:25,920
motor cortex there's substantial
 

19737
06:31:25,920 --> 06:31:27,788
motor cortex there's substantial
evidence that it's uh rate coding or at

19738
06:31:27,788 --> 06:31:27,798
evidence that it's uh rate coding or at
 

19739
06:31:27,798 --> 06:31:29,670
evidence that it's uh rate coding or at
least one like first order of fact is

19740
06:31:29,670 --> 06:31:29,680
least one like first order of fact is
 

19741
06:31:29,680 --> 06:31:32,270
least one like first order of fact is
that it's R coding so then if the brain

19742
06:31:32,270 --> 06:31:32,280
that it's R coding so then if the brain
 

19743
06:31:32,280 --> 06:31:34,628
that it's R coding so then if the brain
is representing information by changing

19744
06:31:34,628 --> 06:31:34,638
is representing information by changing
 

19745
06:31:34,638 --> 06:31:37,830
is representing information by changing
the sort of frequency of a neuron firing

19746
06:31:37,830 --> 06:31:37,840
the sort of frequency of a neuron firing
 

19747
06:31:37,840 --> 06:31:39,670
the sort of frequency of a neuron firing
what really matters is sort of the Delta

19748
06:31:39,670 --> 06:31:39,680
what really matters is sort of the Delta
 

19749
06:31:39,680 --> 06:31:40,910
what really matters is sort of the Delta
between sort of the Baseline state of

19750
06:31:40,910 --> 06:31:40,920
between sort of the Baseline state of
 

19751
06:31:40,920 --> 06:31:42,430
between sort of the Baseline state of
the neuron and what it looks like when

19752
06:31:42,430 --> 06:31:42,440
the neuron and what it looks like when
 

19753
06:31:42,440 --> 06:31:44,750
the neuron and what it looks like when
it's modulated and what we've observed

19754
06:31:44,750 --> 06:31:44,760
it's modulated and what we've observed
 

19755
06:31:44,760 --> 06:31:45,990
it's modulated and what we've observed
and what has also been observed in

19756
06:31:45,990 --> 06:31:46,000
and what has also been observed in
 

19757
06:31:46,000 --> 06:31:47,868
and what has also been observed in
academic work is that that Baseline rate

19758
06:31:47,868 --> 06:31:47,878
academic work is that that Baseline rate
 

19759
06:31:47,878 --> 06:31:49,468
academic work is that that Baseline rate
sort of the if you're to Tar the scale

19760
06:31:49,468 --> 06:31:49,478
sort of the if you're to Tar the scale
 

19761
06:31:49,478 --> 06:31:51,590
sort of the if you're to Tar the scale
if you imagine uh that analogy for like

19762
06:31:51,590 --> 06:31:51,600
if you imagine uh that analogy for like
 

19763
06:31:51,600 --> 06:31:53,628
if you imagine uh that analogy for like
measuring you know flour or something

19764
06:31:53,628 --> 06:31:53,638
measuring you know flour or something
 

19765
06:31:53,638 --> 06:31:55,548
measuring you know flour or something
when you're baking that Baseline state

19766
06:31:55,548 --> 06:31:55,558
when you're baking that Baseline state
 

19767
06:31:55,558 --> 06:31:57,548
when you're baking that Baseline state
of how much the pot weighs is actually

19768
06:31:57,548 --> 06:31:57,558
of how much the pot weighs is actually
 

19769
06:31:57,558 --> 06:31:59,910
of how much the pot weighs is actually
different dayto day mhm and so if what

19770
06:31:59,910 --> 06:31:59,920
different dayto day mhm and so if what
 

19771
06:31:59,920 --> 06:32:00,868
different dayto day mhm and so if what
you're trying to measure is how much

19772
06:32:00,868 --> 06:32:00,878
you're trying to measure is how much
 

19773
06:32:00,878 --> 06:32:02,548
you're trying to measure is how much
rice is in the pot you're going to get a

19774
06:32:02,548 --> 06:32:02,558
rice is in the pot you're going to get a
 

19775
06:32:02,558 --> 06:32:03,590
rice is in the pot you're going to get a
different measurement different days

19776
06:32:03,590 --> 06:32:03,600
different measurement different days
 

19777
06:32:03,600 --> 06:32:04,590
different measurement different days
because you're measuring with different

19778
06:32:04,590 --> 06:32:04,600
because you're measuring with different
 

19779
06:32:04,600 --> 06:32:06,548
because you're measuring with different
pots so that basine rate shifting is

19780
06:32:06,548 --> 06:32:06,558
pots so that basine rate shifting is
 

19781
06:32:06,558 --> 06:32:09,310
pots so that basine rate shifting is
really the thing that uh at least from A

19782
06:32:09,310 --> 06:32:09,320
really the thing that uh at least from A
 

19783
06:32:09,320 --> 06:32:11,190
really the thing that uh at least from A
first order description of the problem

19784
06:32:11,190 --> 06:32:11,200
first order description of the problem
 

19785
06:32:11,200 --> 06:32:12,868
first order description of the problem
is what's causing this Downstream bias

19786
06:32:12,868 --> 06:32:12,878
is what's causing this Downstream bias
 

19787
06:32:12,878 --> 06:32:14,230
is what's causing this Downstream bias
there can be other effects not linear

19788
06:32:14,230 --> 06:32:14,240
there can be other effects not linear
 

19789
06:32:14,240 --> 06:32:15,510
there can be other effects not linear
effects on top of that but at least a

19790
06:32:15,510 --> 06:32:15,520
effects on top of that but at least a
 

19791
06:32:15,520 --> 06:32:16,830
effects on top of that but at least a
very first order description of the

06:32:16,830 --> 06:32:16,840
very first order description of the
 

19793
06:32:16,840 --> 06:32:18,590
very first order description of the
problem that's what we observe today is

19794
06:32:18,590 --> 06:32:18,600
problem that's what we observe today is
 

19795
06:32:18,600 --> 06:32:20,030
problem that's what we observe today is
that the Baseline firing rate of any

19796
06:32:20,030 --> 06:32:20,040
that the Baseline firing rate of any
 

19797
06:32:20,040 --> 06:32:21,868
that the Baseline firing rate of any
particular neuron or observed on a

19798
06:32:21,868 --> 06:32:21,878
particular neuron or observed on a
 

19799
06:32:21,878 --> 06:32:23,990
particular neuron or observed on a
particular channel is changing so can

19800
06:32:23,990 --> 06:32:24,000
particular channel is changing so can
 

19801
06:32:24,000 --> 06:32:27,430
particular channel is changing so can
you just adjust to the Baseline to make

19802
06:32:27,430 --> 06:32:27,440
you just adjust to the Baseline to make
 

19803
06:32:27,440 --> 06:32:29,788
you just adjust to the Baseline to make
it relative to the Baseline nonstop yeah

19804
06:32:29,788 --> 06:32:29,798
it relative to the Baseline nonstop yeah
 

19805
06:32:29,798 --> 06:32:32,948
it relative to the Baseline nonstop yeah
this is a great question so um with

19806
06:32:32,948 --> 06:32:32,958
this is a great question so um with
 

19807
06:32:32,958 --> 06:32:34,868
this is a great question so um with
monkeys we we have found various ways to

19808
06:32:34,868 --> 06:32:34,878
monkeys we we have found various ways to
 

19809
06:32:34,878 --> 06:32:37,548
monkeys we we have found various ways to
do this um one example way to do this is

19810
06:32:37,548 --> 06:32:37,558
do this um one example way to do this is
 

19811
06:32:37,558 --> 06:32:39,910
do this um one example way to do this is
you ask them to do some behavioral task

19812
06:32:39,910 --> 06:32:39,920
you ask them to do some behavioral task
 

19813
06:32:39,920 --> 06:32:41,628
you ask them to do some behavioral task
like play the game with a joystick you

19814
06:32:41,628 --> 06:32:41,638
like play the game with a joystick you
 

19815
06:32:41,638 --> 06:32:44,030
like play the game with a joystick you
measure what's going on in the brain you

19816
06:32:44,030 --> 06:32:44,040
measure what's going on in the brain you
 

19817
06:32:44,040 --> 06:32:45,670
measure what's going on in the brain you
compute some mean of what's going on

19818
06:32:45,670 --> 06:32:45,680
compute some mean of what's going on
 

19819
06:32:45,680 --> 06:32:46,910
compute some mean of what's going on
across all the input features and you

19820
06:32:46,910 --> 06:32:46,920
across all the input features and you
 

19821
06:32:46,920 --> 06:32:48,030
across all the input features and you
subtract that in the input when you're

19822
06:32:48,030 --> 06:32:48,040
subtract that in the input when you're
 

19823
06:32:48,040 --> 06:32:51,270
subtract that in the input when you're
doing your BCI session Works super well

19824
06:32:51,270 --> 06:32:51,280
doing your BCI session Works super well
 

19825
06:32:51,280 --> 06:32:52,830
doing your BCI session Works super well
for whatever reason that doesn't work

19826
06:32:52,830 --> 06:32:52,840
for whatever reason that doesn't work
 

19827
06:32:52,840 --> 06:32:55,510
for whatever reason that doesn't work
super well with Nolan I actually don't

19828
06:32:55,510 --> 06:32:55,520
super well with Nolan I actually don't
 

19829
06:32:55,520 --> 06:32:56,910
super well with Nolan I actually don't
know the full reason why but I can

19830
06:32:56,910 --> 06:32:56,920
know the full reason why but I can
 

19831
06:32:56,920 --> 06:32:58,990
know the full reason why but I can
imagine several several explanations um

19832
06:32:58,990 --> 06:32:59,000
imagine several several explanations um
 

19833
06:32:59,000 --> 06:33:00,430
imagine several several explanations um
one such explanation could be that the

19834
06:33:00,430 --> 06:33:00,440
one such explanation could be that the
 

19835
06:33:00,440 --> 06:33:02,150
one such explanation could be that the
context effect difference between some

19836
06:33:02,150 --> 06:33:02,160
context effect difference between some
 

19837
06:33:02,160 --> 06:33:03,628
context effect difference between some
open loop task and some closed loop task

19838
06:33:03,628 --> 06:33:03,638
open loop task and some closed loop task
 

19839
06:33:03,638 --> 06:33:06,270
open loop task and some closed loop task
is much more significant with um Nolan

19840
06:33:06,270 --> 06:33:06,280
is much more significant with um Nolan
 

19841
06:33:06,280 --> 06:33:07,468
is much more significant with um Nolan
than it is with monkey maybe in this

19842
06:33:07,468 --> 06:33:07,478
than it is with monkey maybe in this
 

19843
06:33:07,478 --> 06:33:09,070
than it is with monkey maybe in this
open loop task he's you know watching

19844
06:33:09,070 --> 06:33:09,080
open loop task he's you know watching
 

19845
06:33:09,080 --> 06:33:10,670
open loop task he's you know watching
The Lex Freeman podcast while he's doing

19846
06:33:10,670 --> 06:33:10,680
The Lex Freeman podcast while he's doing
 

19847
06:33:10,680 --> 06:33:12,548
The Lex Freeman podcast while he's doing
the task or he's whistling and listening

19848
06:33:12,548 --> 06:33:12,558
the task or he's whistling and listening
 

19849
06:33:12,558 --> 06:33:14,230
the task or he's whistling and listening
to music and talking with his friend and

19850
06:33:14,230 --> 06:33:14,240
to music and talking with his friend and
 

19851
06:33:14,240 --> 06:33:15,628
to music and talking with his friend and
ask his mom what's for dinner while he's

19852
06:33:15,628 --> 06:33:15,638
ask his mom what's for dinner while he's
 

19853
06:33:15,638 --> 06:33:17,750
ask his mom what's for dinner while he's
doing this task and so the the exact

19854
06:33:17,750 --> 06:33:17,760
doing this task and so the the exact
 

19855
06:33:17,760 --> 06:33:20,590
doing this task and so the the exact
sort of difference in context between

19856
06:33:20,590 --> 06:33:20,600
sort of difference in context between
 

19857
06:33:20,600 --> 06:33:22,468
sort of difference in context between
those two states may be much larger and

19858
06:33:22,468 --> 06:33:22,478
those two states may be much larger and
 

19859
06:33:22,478 --> 06:33:24,030
those two states may be much larger and
thus lead to a bigger S generalization

19860
06:33:24,030 --> 06:33:24,040
thus lead to a bigger S generalization
 

19861
06:33:24,040 --> 06:33:25,830
thus lead to a bigger S generalization
gap between the features that you're

19862
06:33:25,830 --> 06:33:25,840
gap between the features that you're
 

19863
06:33:25,840 --> 06:33:27,868
gap between the features that you're
normalizing at sort of open loop time

19864
06:33:27,868 --> 06:33:27,878
normalizing at sort of open loop time
 

19865
06:33:27,878 --> 06:33:28,830
normalizing at sort of open loop time
and what you're trying to use at close

19866
06:33:28,830 --> 06:33:28,840
and what you're trying to use at close
 

19867
06:33:28,840 --> 06:33:30,868
and what you're trying to use at close
loop time that's interesting just on

19868
06:33:30,868 --> 06:33:30,878
loop time that's interesting just on
 

19869
06:33:30,878 --> 06:33:33,190
loop time that's interesting just on
that point it's kind of incredible to

19870
06:33:33,190 --> 06:33:33,200
that point it's kind of incredible to
 

19871
06:33:33,200 --> 06:33:35,670
that point it's kind of incredible to
watch noan be able to do uh to multitask

19872
06:33:35,670 --> 06:33:35,680
watch noan be able to do uh to multitask
 

19873
06:33:35,680 --> 06:33:37,868
watch noan be able to do uh to multitask
to do multiple tasks at the same time to

normalize to the Baseline that might

19890
06:33:55,788 --> 06:33:55,798
normalize to the Baseline that might
 

19891
06:33:55,798 --> 06:33:57,430
normalize to the Baseline that might
throw everything

19892
06:33:57,430 --> 06:33:57,440
throw everything
 

19893
06:33:57,440 --> 06:34:00,070

off boy is that interesting maybe one

19894
06:34:00,070 --> 06:34:00,080
off boy is that interesting maybe one
 

19895
06:34:00,080 --> 06:34:01,468
off boy is that interesting maybe one
comment on that too for folks that

19896
06:34:01,468 --> 06:34:01,478
comment on that too for folks that
 

19897
06:34:01,478 --> 06:34:03,190
comment on that too for folks that
aren't familiar with assisted technology

19898
06:34:03,190 --> 06:34:03,200
aren't familiar with assisted technology
 

19899
06:34:03,200 --> 06:34:04,670
aren't familiar with assisted technology
I think there's a common belief that you

19900
06:34:04,670 --> 06:34:04,680
I think there's a common belief that you
 

19901
06:34:04,680 --> 06:34:06,070
I think there's a common belief that you
know well why can't you just use an eye

19902
06:34:06,070 --> 06:34:06,080
know well why can't you just use an eye
 

19903
06:34:06,080 --> 06:34:08,150
know well why can't you just use an eye
tracker or something like this for

19904
06:34:08,150 --> 06:34:08,160
tracker or something like this for
 

19905
06:34:08,160 --> 06:34:09,310
tracker or something like this for
helping somebody move a mouse on the

19906
06:34:09,310 --> 06:34:09,320
helping somebody move a mouse on the
 

19907
06:34:09,320 --> 06:34:10,948
helping somebody move a mouse on the
screen and it's it's a really a fair

19908
06:34:10,948 --> 06:34:10,958
screen and it's it's a really a fair
 

19909
06:34:10,958 --> 06:34:13,230
screen and it's it's a really a fair
question and one that I actually did was

19910
06:34:13,230 --> 06:34:13,240
question and one that I actually did was
 

19911
06:34:13,240 --> 06:34:15,670
question and one that I actually did was
not confident before s Nolan that this

19912
06:34:15,670 --> 06:34:15,680
not confident before s Nolan that this
 

19913
06:34:15,680 --> 06:34:16,628
not confident before s Nolan that this
was going to be a profoundly

19914
06:34:16,628 --> 06:34:16,638
was going to be a profoundly
 

19915
06:34:16,638 --> 06:34:18,230
was going to be a profoundly
transformative technology for people

19916
06:34:18,230 --> 06:34:18,240
transformative technology for people
 

19917
06:34:18,240 --> 06:34:20,750
transformative technology for people
like him and uh I'm very confident now

19918
06:34:20,750 --> 06:34:20,760
like him and uh I'm very confident now
 

19919
06:34:20,760 --> 06:34:21,990
like him and uh I'm very confident now
that it will be but the reasons are

19920
06:34:21,990 --> 06:34:22,000
that it will be but the reasons are
 

19921
06:34:22,000 --> 06:34:23,190
that it will be but the reasons are
subtle it really has to do with

19922
06:34:23,190 --> 06:34:23,200
subtle it really has to do with
 

19923
06:34:23,200 --> 06:34:24,670
subtle it really has to do with
ergonomically how it fits into their

19924
06:34:24,670 --> 06:34:24,680
ergonomically how it fits into their
 

19925
06:34:24,680 --> 06:34:26,910
ergonomically how it fits into their
life even if you can just offer the same

19926
06:34:26,910 --> 06:34:26,920
life even if you can just offer the same
 

19927
06:34:26,920 --> 06:34:28,910
life even if you can just offer the same
level of control as what they would have

19928
06:34:28,910 --> 06:34:28,920
level of control as what they would have
 

19929
06:34:28,920 --> 06:34:31,310
level of control as what they would have
with an ey tracker or with a mouse sck

19930
06:34:31,310 --> 06:34:31,320
with an ey tracker or with a mouse sck
 

19931
06:34:31,320 --> 06:34:32,510
with an ey tracker or with a mouse sck
but you don't need to have that thing in

19932
06:34:32,510 --> 06:34:32,520
but you don't need to have that thing in
 

19933
06:34:32,520 --> 06:34:33,990
but you don't need to have that thing in
your face you don't need to be position

19934
06:34:33,990 --> 06:34:34,000
your face you don't need to be position
 

19935
06:34:34,000 --> 06:34:35,270
your face you don't need to be position
a certain way you don't need your

19936
06:34:35,270 --> 06:34:35,280
a certain way you don't need your
 

19937
06:34:35,280 --> 06:34:36,788
a certain way you don't need your
caretaker to be around to set it up for

19938
06:34:36,788 --> 06:34:36,798
caretaker to be around to set it up for
 

19939
06:34:36,798 --> 06:34:38,830
caretaker to be around to set it up for
you you can activate it when you want

19940
06:34:38,830 --> 06:34:38,840
you you can activate it when you want
 

19941
06:34:38,840 --> 06:34:40,548
you you can activate it when you want
how you want wherever you want that

gamechanging thing for folks in that
 

19961
06:34:57,680 --> 06:34:59,270
gamechanging thing for folks in that

19962
06:34:59,270 --> 06:34:59,280
situation and this is even before we
 

19963
06:34:59,280 --> 06:35:01,030
situation and this is even before we
start talking about folks that you know

19964
06:35:01,030 --> 06:35:01,040
start talking about folks that you know
 

19965
06:35:01,040 --> 06:35:02,310
start talking about folks that you know
may not be able to communicate at all or

the potentially the only link that they
 

19971
06:35:05,360 --> 06:35:07,628
the potentially the only link that they
have to the outside world and uh yeah

19972
06:35:07,628 --> 06:35:07,638
have to the outside world and uh yeah
 

19973
06:35:07,638 --> 06:35:08,548
have to the outside world and uh yeah
that one doesn't I think need

19974
06:35:08,548 --> 06:35:08,558
that one doesn't I think need
 

19975
06:35:08,558 --> 06:35:10,990
that one doesn't I think need
explanation of why that's so impactful

a decoder that figures out what these uh

19988
06:35:26,430 --> 06:35:26,440
a decoder that figures out what these uh
 

19989
06:35:26,440 --> 06:35:29,708
a decoder that figures out what these uh
sequence of spikes mean yeah good

19990
06:35:29,708 --> 06:35:29,718
sequence of spikes mean yeah good
 

19991
06:35:29,718 --> 06:35:31,430
sequence of spikes mean yeah good
question uh there's a couple different

19992
06:35:31,430 --> 06:35:31,440
question uh there's a couple different
 

19993
06:35:31,440 --> 06:35:33,150
question uh there's a couple different
ways to answer this so maybe I'll zoom

19994
06:35:33,150 --> 06:35:33,160
ways to answer this so maybe I'll zoom
 

19995
06:35:33,160 --> 06:35:35,150
ways to answer this so maybe I'll zoom
out briefly first and then I'll go down

19996
06:35:35,150 --> 06:35:35,160
out briefly first and then I'll go down
 

19997
06:35:35,160 --> 06:35:37,070
out briefly first and then I'll go down
one of the rabbit holes so the zoomed

19998
06:35:37,070 --> 06:35:37,080
one of the rabbit holes so the zoomed
 

19999
06:35:37,080 --> 06:35:38,830
one of the rabbit holes so the zoomed
out view is that building the decoder is

20000
06:35:38,830 --> 06:35:38,840
out view is that building the decoder is
 

20001
06:35:38,840 --> 06:35:40,030
out view is that building the decoder is
really the process of building the data

20002
06:35:40,030 --> 06:35:40,040
really the process of building the data
 

20003
06:35:40,040 --> 06:35:42,628
really the process of building the data
set plus compiling it into the weights

20004
06:35:42,628 --> 06:35:42,638
set plus compiling it into the weights
 

20005
06:35:42,638 --> 06:35:45,030
set plus compiling it into the weights
and uh each of those steps is important

20006
06:35:45,030 --> 06:35:45,040
and uh each of those steps is important
 

20007
06:35:45,040 --> 06:35:46,270
and uh each of those steps is important
uh the direction I think of further

20008
06:35:46,270 --> 06:35:46,280
uh the direction I think of further
 

20009
06:35:46,280 --> 06:35:47,670
uh the direction I think of further
Improvement is primarily going to be in

20010
06:35:47,670 --> 06:35:47,680
Improvement is primarily going to be in
 

20011
06:35:47,680 --> 06:35:48,708
Improvement is primarily going to be in
the data set side of how do you

20012
06:35:48,708 --> 06:35:48,718
the data set side of how do you
 

20013
06:35:48,718 --> 06:35:50,070
the data set side of how do you
construct the optimal labels for the

20014
06:35:50,070 --> 06:35:50,080
construct the optimal labels for the
 

20015
06:35:50,080 --> 06:35:52,150
construct the optimal labels for the
model but there's an entirely separate

20016
06:35:52,150 --> 06:35:52,160
model but there's an entirely separate
 

20017
06:35:52,160 --> 06:35:53,670
model but there's an entirely separate
challenge of then how do you compile it

20018
06:35:53,670 --> 06:35:53,680
challenge of then how do you compile it
 

20019
06:35:53,680 --> 06:35:55,270
challenge of then how do you compile it
the best model and so I'll go briefly

20020
06:35:55,270 --> 06:35:55,280
the best model and so I'll go briefly
 

20021
06:35:55,280 --> 06:35:56,590
the best model and so I'll go briefly
down the second one down the second

20022
06:35:56,590 --> 06:35:56,600
down the second one down the second
 

20023
06:35:56,600 --> 06:35:59,270
down the second one down the second
Rabbit Hole one of the main challenges

20024
06:35:59,270 --> 06:35:59,280
Rabbit Hole one of the main challenges
 

20025
06:35:59,280 --> 06:36:02,750
Rabbit Hole one of the main challenges
with designing the optimal model for BCI

20026
06:36:02,750 --> 06:36:02,760
with designing the optimal model for BCI
 

20027
06:36:02,760 --> 06:36:04,070
with designing the optimal model for BCI
is that offline metrics don't

20028
06:36:04,070 --> 06:36:04,080
is that offline metrics don't
 

20029
06:36:04,080 --> 06:36:06,230
is that offline metrics don't
necessarily correspond to online metrics

20030
06:36:06,230 --> 06:36:06,240
necessarily correspond to online metrics
 

20031
06:36:06,240 --> 06:36:08,190
necessarily correspond to online metrics
M uh it's fundamentally a control

20032
06:36:08,190 --> 06:36:08,200
M uh it's fundamentally a control
 

20033
06:36:08,200 --> 06:36:09,910
M uh it's fundamentally a control
problem the user is trying to control

20034
06:36:09,910 --> 06:36:09,920
problem the user is trying to control
 

20035
06:36:09,920 --> 06:36:12,070
problem the user is trying to control
something on the screen and the exact

20036
06:36:12,070 --> 06:36:12,080
something on the screen and the exact
 

20037
06:36:12,080 --> 06:36:14,788
something on the screen and the exact
sort of user experience of how you

20038
06:36:14,788 --> 06:36:14,798
sort of user experience of how you
 

20039
06:36:14,798 --> 06:36:18,030
sort of user experience of how you
output the intention uh impacts your

20040
06:36:18,030 --> 06:36:18,040
output the intention uh impacts your
 

20041
06:36:18,040 --> 06:36:20,230
output the intention uh impacts your
ability to control so for example if you

20042
06:36:20,230 --> 06:36:20,240
ability to control so for example if you
 

20043
06:36:20,240 --> 06:36:22,510
ability to control so for example if you
just look at validation loss as

20044
06:36:22,510 --> 06:36:22,520
just look at validation loss as
 

20045
06:36:22,520 --> 06:36:24,310
just look at validation loss as
predicted by your model there can be

20046
06:36:24,310 --> 06:36:24,320
predicted by your model there can be
 

20047
06:36:24,320 --> 06:36:25,270
predicted by your model there can be

06:36:35,320 --> 06:36:37,270
the thing that actually matters but this
is a very complex Nuance process so how

20062
06:36:37,270 --> 06:36:37,280
is a very complex Nuance process so how
 

20063
06:36:37,280 --> 06:36:40,830
is a very complex Nuance process so how
you turn the labels into the model is uh

06:36:40,830 --> 06:36:40,840
you turn the labels into the model is uh
 

20065
06:36:40,840 --> 06:36:42,230
you turn the labels into the model is uh
more of a Nuance process than just like

06:37:14,190 --> 06:37:14,200
over the input signal so if you imagine
 

20095
06:37:14,200 --> 06:37:16,230
over the input signal so if you imagine
per Channel you have a sliding window

better validation metrics meaning you're

20106
06:37:25,388 --> 06:37:25,398
better validation metrics meaning you're
 

20107
06:37:25,398 --> 06:37:26,830
better validation metrics meaning you're
fitting the data better and it's

generalizing better on offline data if
 

20111
06:37:28,600 --> 06:37:29,910
generalizing better on offline data if
you use this convolutional architecture

20112

you use this convolutional architecture
 

20113
06:37:29,920 --> 06:37:31,110
you use this convolutional architecture
you're reducing parameters it's sort of

20114
06:37:31,110 --> 06:37:31,120
you're reducing parameters it's sort of
 

20115
06:37:31,120 --> 06:37:34,070
you're reducing parameters it's sort of
a standard uh uh standard procedure when

20116
06:37:34,070 --> 06:37:34,080
a standard uh uh standard procedure when

you're dealing with time series data now
 

20119
06:37:35,638 --> 06:37:37,030
you're dealing with time series data now
it turns out that when using that model

20120
06:37:37,030 --> 06:37:37,040
it turns out that when using that model
 

20121
06:37:37,040 --> 06:37:39,708
it turns out that when using that model
online the controlability was was worse

20122
06:37:39,708 --> 06:37:39,718
online the controlability was was worse
 

20123
06:37:39,718 --> 06:37:40,990
online the controlability was was worse
was far worse even though the offline

20124
06:37:40,990 --> 06:37:41,000
was far worse even though the offline
 

20125
06:37:41,000 --> 06:37:43,190

metrics were better and uh there can be

20126
06:37:43,190 --> 06:37:43,200
metrics were better and uh there can be
 

20127
06:37:43,200 --> 06:37:45,110
metrics were better and uh there can be
many ways to interpret that but what

20128
06:37:45,110 --> 06:37:45,120
many ways to interpret that but what
 

20129
06:37:45,120 --> 06:37:46,948
many ways to interpret that but what
that taught me at least was that hey

20130
06:37:46,948 --> 06:37:46,958
that taught me at least was that hey
 

20131
06:37:46,958 --> 06:37:48,468
that taught me at least was that hey
it's at least the case right now that if

20132
06:37:48,468 --> 06:37:48,478
it's at least the case right now that if
 

20133
06:37:48,478 --> 06:37:49,788
it's at least the case right now that if
you were to just throw a bunch of comput

20134
06:37:49,788 --> 06:37:49,798
you were to just throw a bunch of comput
 

20135
06:37:49,798 --> 06:37:52,388
you were to just throw a bunch of comput
at this problem and you were trying to

20136
06:37:52,388 --> 06:37:52,398
at this problem and you were trying to
 

20137
06:37:52,398 --> 06:37:54,190
at this problem and you were trying to
sort of hyper parameter optimize or you

20138
06:37:54,190 --> 06:37:54,200
sort of hyper parameter optimize or you
 

20139
06:37:54,200 --> 06:37:56,310
sort of hyper parameter optimize or you
know let some gbt model hard code or

20140
06:37:56,310 --> 06:37:56,320
know let some gbt model hard code or
 

20141
06:37:56,320 --> 06:37:57,510
know let some gbt model hard code or
come up with or invent many different

06:37:57,510 --> 06:37:57,520
come up with or invent many different
 

20143
06:37:57,520 --> 06:37:59,190
come up with or invent many different
solutions if you were just optimizing

20144
06:37:59,190 --> 06:37:59,200
solutions if you were just optimizing
 

20145
06:37:59,200 --> 06:38:00,948

for loss it would not be sufficient

20146
06:38:00,948 --> 06:38:00,958
for loss it would not be sufficient
 

20147
06:38:00,958 --> 06:38:02,388
for loss it would not be sufficient
which means that there's still some

20148
06:38:02,388 --> 06:38:02,398
which means that there's still some
 

20149
06:38:02,398 --> 06:38:03,948
which means that there's still some
inherent modeling Gap there's still some

20150
06:38:03,948 --> 06:38:03,958
inherent modeling Gap there's still some
 

20151
06:38:03,958 --> 06:38:05,388

06:38:07,590 --> 06:38:07,600
how to get your model to scale with more
 

20155
06:38:07,600 --> 06:38:09,830
how to get your model to scale with more
compute and that may be fundamentally

20156
06:38:09,830 --> 06:38:09,840
compute and that may be fundamentally
 

20157
06:38:09,840 --> 06:38:10,910
compute and that may be fundamentally
labeling problem but there may be other

20158
06:38:10,910 --> 06:38:10,920
labeling problem but there may be other
 

20159
06:38:10,920 --> 06:38:14,548
labeling problem but there may be other
components to this as well is it uh data

20160
06:38:14,548 --> 06:38:14,558
components to this as well is it uh data
 

20161
06:38:14,558 --> 06:38:17,350
components to this as well is it uh data
constrainted at this time like the which

20162
06:38:17,350 --> 06:38:17,360
constrainted at this time like the which
 

20163
06:38:17,360 --> 06:38:19,468
constrainted at this time like the which
is what it sounds like

20164
06:38:19,468 --> 06:38:19,478
is what it sounds like
 

20165
06:38:19,478 --> 06:38:22,628
is what it sounds like
like how do you get a lot of good labels

20166
06:38:22,628 --> 06:38:22,638
like how do you get a lot of good labels
 

20167
06:38:22,638 --> 06:38:23,910
like how do you get a lot of good labels
yeah I think it's data quality

20168
06:38:23,910 --> 06:38:23,920
yeah I think it's data quality
 

20169
06:38:23,920 --> 06:38:25,230
yeah I think it's data quality
constrained not necessarily data

20170
06:38:25,230 --> 06:38:25,240
constrained not necessarily data
 

20171
06:38:25,240 --> 06:38:26,750
constrained not necessarily data
quantity

20172
06:38:26,750 --> 06:38:26,760
quantity
 

20173
06:38:26,760 --> 06:38:30,230
quantity
constrainted but even like even just the

20174
06:38:30,230 --> 06:38:30,240
constrainted but even like even just the
 

20175
06:38:30,240 --> 06:38:31,910
constrainted but even like even just the
quantity I mean because it has to be

20176
06:38:31,910 --> 06:38:31,920
quantity I mean because it has to be
 

20177
06:38:31,920 --> 06:38:35,190
quantity I mean because it has to be
trained on the on the interaction

20178
06:38:35,190 --> 06:38:35,200
trained on the on the interaction
 

20179
06:38:35,200 --> 06:38:36,628
trained on the on the interaction
I guess there's not that many

20180
06:38:36,628 --> 06:38:36,638
I guess there's not that many
 

20181
06:38:36,638 --> 06:38:38,948
I guess there's not that many
interactions yeah so it depends what

20182
06:38:38,948 --> 06:38:38,958
interactions yeah so it depends what
 

20183
06:38:38,958 --> 06:38:39,990
interactions yeah so it depends what
version of this you're talking about so

20184
06:38:39,990 --> 06:38:40,000
version of this you're talking about so
 

20185
06:38:40,000 --> 06:38:40,830
version of this you're talking about so
if you're talking about like let's say

20186
06:38:40,830 --> 06:38:40,840
if you're talking about like let's say
 

20187
06:38:40,840 --> 06:38:42,910
if you're talking about like let's say
the simplest example of just 2D velocity

20188
06:38:42,910 --> 06:38:42,920
the simplest example of just 2D velocity
 

20189
06:38:42,920 --> 06:38:44,110
the simplest example of just 2D velocity
then I think yeah data quality is the

20190
06:38:44,110 --> 06:38:44,120
then I think yeah data quality is the
 

20191
06:38:44,120 --> 06:38:45,070
then I think yeah data quality is the
main thing if you're talking about how

20192
06:38:45,070 --> 06:38:45,080
main thing if you're talking about how
 

20193
06:38:45,080 --> 06:38:47,190
main thing if you're talking about how
to build a sort of multifunction output

20194
06:38:47,190 --> 06:38:47,200
to build a sort of multifunction output
 

20195
06:38:47,200 --> 06:38:48,548
to build a sort of multifunction output
that lets you do all the inputs the

20196
06:38:48,548 --> 06:38:48,558
that lets you do all the inputs the
 

20197
06:38:48,558 --> 06:38:50,590
that lets you do all the inputs the
computer that you and I can do then it's

20198
06:38:50,590 --> 06:38:50,600
computer that you and I can do then it's
 

20199
06:38:50,600 --> 06:38:52,230
computer that you and I can do then it's
actually a much more sophisticated

20200
06:38:52,230 --> 06:38:52,240
actually a much more sophisticated
 

20201
06:38:52,240 --> 06:38:54,150
actually a much more sophisticated
Nuance modeling challenge because now

20202
06:38:54,150 --> 06:38:54,160
Nuance modeling challenge because now
 

20203
06:38:54,160 --> 06:38:56,110
Nuance modeling challenge because now
you need to think about not just when

20204
06:38:56,110 --> 06:38:56,120
you need to think about not just when
 

20205
06:38:56,120 --> 06:38:57,628
you need to think about not just when
the user is left clicking but when

20206
06:38:57,628 --> 06:38:57,638
the user is left clicking but when
 

20207
06:38:57,638 --> 06:38:58,708
the user is left clicking but when
you're building the left click model you

20208
06:38:58,708 --> 06:38:58,718
you're building the left click model you
 

20209
06:38:58,718 --> 06:38:59,750
you're building the left click model you
also need to be thinking about how to

20210
06:38:59,750 --> 06:38:59,760
also need to be thinking about how to
 

20211
06:38:59,760 --> 06:39:00,830
also need to be thinking about how to
make sure it doesn't fire when they're

20212
06:39:00,830 --> 06:39:00,840
make sure it doesn't fire when they're
 

20213
06:39:00,840 --> 06:39:01,910
make sure it doesn't fire when they're
trying to right click or they're trying

20214
06:39:01,910 --> 06:39:01,920
trying to right click or they're trying
 

20215
06:39:01,920 --> 06:39:03,670
trying to right click or they're trying
to move the mouse so one examp of an

interesting bug from like sort of week

20218
06:39:05,070 --> 06:39:05,080
interesting bug from like sort of week
 

20219
06:39:05,080 --> 06:39:08,628
interesting bug from like sort of week
one of uh BCI with Nolan was when he

20220
06:39:08,628 --> 06:39:08,638
one of uh BCI with Nolan was when he
 

20221
06:39:08,638 --> 06:39:10,948
one of uh BCI with Nolan was when he
moved the mouse uh The Click signal sort

20222
06:39:10,948 --> 06:39:10,958
moved the mouse uh The Click signal sort
 

20223
06:39:10,958 --> 06:39:11,910
moved the mouse uh The Click signal sort
of dropped off a cliff and when he

20224
06:39:11,910 --> 06:39:11,920
of dropped off a cliff and when he
 

20225
06:39:11,920 --> 06:39:13,150
of dropped off a cliff and when he
stopped the click in went up so again

20226
06:39:13,150 --> 06:39:13,160
stopped the click in went up so again
 

20227
06:39:13,160 --> 06:39:15,070
stopped the click in went up so again
there's a contamination between the the

20228
06:39:15,070 --> 06:39:15,080
there's a contamination between the the
 

20229
06:39:15,080 --> 06:39:16,708
there's a contamination between the the
two the two inputs another good example

20230
06:39:16,708 --> 06:39:16,718
two the two inputs another good example
 

20231
06:39:16,718 --> 06:39:19,510
two the two inputs another good example
was at one point he was trying to do uh

20232
06:39:19,510 --> 06:39:19,520
was at one point he was trying to do uh
 

20233
06:39:19,520 --> 06:39:21,830
was at one point he was trying to do uh
sort of a left click and drad and the

20234
06:39:21,830 --> 06:39:21,840
sort of a left click and drad and the
 

20235
06:39:21,840 --> 06:39:24,350
sort of a left click and drad and the
minute he started moving the left click

20236
06:39:24,350 --> 06:39:24,360
minute he started moving the left click
 

20237
06:39:24,360 --> 06:39:26,270
minute he started moving the left click
signal dropped off a cliff so again

20238
06:39:26,270 --> 06:39:26,280
signal dropped off a cliff so again
 

20239
06:39:26,280 --> 06:39:27,190
signal dropped off a cliff so again
because there's some contamination

20240
06:39:27,190 --> 06:39:27,200
because there's some contamination
 

20241
06:39:27,200 --> 06:39:28,670
because there's some contamination
between the two signals you you need to

20242
06:39:28,670 --> 06:39:28,680
between the two signals you you need to
 

20243
06:39:28,680 --> 06:39:30,110
between the two signals you you need to
come up with some way to either in the

20244
06:39:30,110 --> 06:39:30,120
come up with some way to either in the
 

20245
06:39:30,120 --> 06:39:32,430
come up with some way to either in the
data set or in the model build

20246
06:39:32,430 --> 06:39:32,440
data set or in the model build

robustness against this kind of uh you

20248
06:39:35,468 --> 06:39:35,478
robustness against this kind of uh you
 

20249
06:39:35,478 --> 06:39:36,628
robustness against this kind of uh you
think of it like overfitting but really

20250
06:39:36,628 --> 06:39:36,638
think of it like overfitting but really
 

20251
06:39:36,638 --> 06:39:38,350
think of it like overfitting but really
it's just that the model has not seen

20252
06:39:38,350 --> 06:39:38,360
it's just that the model has not seen
 

20253
06:39:38,360 --> 06:39:40,110
it's just that the model has not seen
this kind of variability before so you

20254
06:39:40,110 --> 06:39:40,120
this kind of variability before so you
 

20255
06:39:40,120 --> 06:39:41,430
this kind of variability before so you
need to find some way to help the model

20256
06:39:41,430 --> 06:39:41,440
need to find some way to help the model
 

20257
06:39:41,440 --> 06:39:43,430
need to find some way to help the model
with that this is super cool cuz I it

20258
06:39:43,430 --> 06:39:43,440
with that this is super cool cuz I it
 

20259
06:39:43,440 --> 06:39:45,590
with that this is super cool cuz I it
feels like all of this is very solvable

feels like all of this is very solvable
 

20261
06:39:45,600 --> 06:39:47,548
feels like all of this is very solvable
but it's hard yes it is fundamentally an

06:39:47,548 --> 06:39:47,558
but it's hard yes it is fundamentally an
 

20263
06:39:47,558 --> 06:39:48,708
but it's hard yes it is fundamentally an
engineering challenge this is important

06:39:48,708 --> 06:39:48,718
engineering challenge this is important
 

20265
06:39:48,718 --> 06:39:49,948
engineering challenge this is important
to emphasize and it's also important to

the current state and if not what are
 

20333
06:40:51,558 --> 06:40:53,708
the current state and if not what are
the gaps and if there are gaps how do we

20334
06:40:53,708 --> 06:40:53,718
the gaps and if there are gaps how do we
 

20335
06:40:53,718 --> 06:40:56,110
the gaps and if there are gaps how do we
solve them most most efficiently so

20336
06:40:56,110 --> 06:40:56,120
solve them most most efficiently so
 

20337
06:40:56,120 --> 06:40:57,190
solve them most most efficiently so
that's what I'm very excited about for

20338
06:40:57,190 --> 06:40:57,200
that's what I'm very excited about for
 

20339
06:40:57,200 --> 06:40:59,110
that's what I'm very excited about for
the next year or so of clinical trial

20340
06:40:59,110 --> 06:40:59,120
the next year or so of clinical trial

I'm quite excited about basically

20344
06:41:04,230 --> 06:41:04,240
I'm quite excited about basically
 

20345
06:41:04,240 --> 06:41:05,708
I'm quite excited about basically
everything we're doing I think uh it's

20346
06:41:05,708 --> 06:41:05,718
everything we're doing I think uh it's
 

20347
06:41:05,718 --> 06:41:08,190
everything we're doing I think uh it's
going to be awesome the most prominent

20348
06:41:08,190 --> 06:41:08,200
going to be awesome the most prominent
 

20349
06:41:08,200 --> 06:41:09,788
going to be awesome the most prominent
one I would say is is scaling Channel

20350
06:41:09,788 --> 06:41:09,798

count so right now we have a th000
channel device the next version will

20354
06:41:12,910 --> 06:41:12,920
channel device the next version will
 

20355
06:41:12,920 --> 06:41:14,868
channel device the next version will
have between 3 and 6,000 channels and I

20356
06:41:14,868 --> 06:41:14,878
have between 3 and 6,000 channels and I
 

20357
06:41:14,878 --> 06:41:16,230
have between 3 and 6,000 channels and I
would expect that curve to continue in

20358
06:41:16,230 --> 06:41:16,240
would expect that curve to continue in
 

20359
06:41:16,240 --> 06:41:18,830
would expect that curve to continue in
the future and it's unclear what set of

20360
06:41:18,830 --> 06:41:18,840
the future and it's unclear what set of
 

20361
06:41:18,840 --> 06:41:21,030
the future and it's unclear what set of
problems will just Disappear Completely

20362
06:41:21,030 --> 06:41:21,040
problems will just Disappear Completely
 

20363
06:41:21,040 --> 06:41:22,830
problems will just Disappear Completely
at that scale and what set of problems

20364
06:41:22,830 --> 06:41:22,840
at that scale and what set of problems
 

20365
06:41:22,840 --> 06:41:24,430
at that scale and what set of problems
will remain and require further focus

20366
06:41:24,430 --> 06:41:24,440
will remain and require further focus
 

20367
06:41:24,440 --> 06:41:25,788
will remain and require further focus
and so I'm excited about the clarity of

20368
06:41:25,788 --> 06:41:25,798
and so I'm excited about the clarity of
 

20369
06:41:25,798 --> 06:41:27,510
and so I'm excited about the clarity of
gradient that that gives us in terms of

20370
06:41:27,510 --> 06:41:27,520
gradient that that gives us in terms of
 

20371
06:41:27,520 --> 06:41:28,868
gradient that that gives us in terms of
the user experiences we choose to focus

20372
06:41:28,868 --> 06:41:28,878
the user experiences we choose to focus
 

20373
06:41:28,878 --> 06:41:31,388
the user experiences we choose to focus
our time and resources on and also in

20374
06:41:31,388 --> 06:41:31,398
our time and resources on and also in
 

20375
06:41:31,398 --> 06:41:33,468
our time and resources on and also in
terms of the you even things as simple

20376
06:41:33,468 --> 06:41:33,478
terms of the you even things as simple
 

20377
06:41:33,478 --> 06:41:35,150
terms of the you even things as simple
as nonstationarity like does that

20378
06:41:35,150 --> 06:41:35,160
as nonstationarity like does that
 

20379
06:41:35,160 --> 06:41:36,230
as nonstationarity like does that
problem just completely go away at that

20380
06:41:36,230 --> 06:41:36,240
problem just completely go away at that
 

20381
06:41:36,240 --> 06:41:37,590
problem just completely go away at that
scale or do we need to come up with new

20382
06:41:37,590 --> 06:41:37,600
scale or do we need to come up with new
 

20383
06:41:37,600 --> 06:41:40,750
scale or do we need to come up with new
creative uis still even at that point um

20384
06:41:40,750 --> 06:41:40,760
creative uis still even at that point um
 

20385
06:41:40,760 --> 06:41:42,830
creative uis still even at that point um
and also when we get to that time point

20386
06:41:42,830 --> 06:41:42,840
and also when we get to that time point
 

20387
06:41:42,840 --> 06:41:43,788
and also when we get to that time point
when we start expanding out

20388
06:41:43,788 --> 06:41:43,798
when we start expanding out
 

20389
06:41:43,798 --> 06:41:45,110
when we start expanding out
traumatically the set of functions that

20390
06:41:45,110 --> 06:41:45,120
traumatically the set of functions that
 

20391
06:41:45,120 --> 06:41:47,590
traumatically the set of functions that
you can output from one brain how to

20392
06:41:47,590 --> 06:41:47,600
you can output from one brain how to
 

20393
06:41:47,600 --> 06:41:49,990
you can output from one brain how to
deal with all the nuances of both the

20394
06:41:49,990 --> 06:41:50,000
deal with all the nuances of both the
 

20395
06:41:50,000 --> 06:41:51,270
deal with all the nuances of both the
user experience of not being able to

20396
06:41:51,270 --> 06:41:51,280
user experience of not being able to
 

20397
06:41:51,280 --> 06:41:52,350
user experience of not being able to
feel the different keys under your

20398
06:41:52,350 --> 06:41:52,360
feel the different keys under your
 

20399
06:41:52,360 --> 06:41:53,788
feel the different keys under your
fingertips but still need to be able to

20400
06:41:53,788 --> 06:41:53,798
fingertips but still need to be able to
 

20401
06:41:53,798 --> 06:41:55,230
fingertips but still need to be able to
modulate all of them in synchrony to

20402
06:41:55,230 --> 06:41:55,240
modulate all of them in synchrony to
 

20403
06:41:55,240 --> 06:41:57,750
modulate all of them in synchrony to
achieve the thing you want and uh again

20404
06:41:57,750 --> 06:41:57,760
achieve the thing you want and uh again
 

20405
06:41:57,760 --> 06:41:58,948
achieve the thing you want and uh again
you don't have that prop set to feedback

20406
06:41:58,948 --> 06:41:58,958
you don't have that prop set to feedback
 

20407
06:41:58,958 --> 06:42:00,150
you don't have that prop set to feedback
loop so how can you make that intuitive

20408
06:42:00,150 --> 06:42:00,160
loop so how can you make that intuitive
 

20409
06:42:00,160 --> 06:42:01,388
loop so how can you make that intuitive
for a user to control a high dimensional

20410
06:42:01,388 --> 06:42:01,398
for a user to control a high dimensional
 

20411
06:42:01,398 --> 06:42:03,230
for a user to control a high dimensional
control surface without feeling the

20412
06:42:03,230 --> 06:42:03,240
control surface without feeling the
 

20413
06:42:03,240 --> 06:42:05,110
control surface without feeling the
thing physically I think that's going to

20414
06:42:05,110 --> 06:42:05,120
thing physically I think that's going to
 

20415
06:42:05,120 --> 06:42:07,270
thing physically I think that's going to
be a super interesting problem uh I'm

20416
06:42:07,270 --> 06:42:07,280
be a super interesting problem uh I'm
 

20417
06:42:07,280 --> 06:42:09,590
be a super interesting problem uh I'm
also quite excited to understand uh you

20418
06:42:09,590 --> 06:42:09,600
also quite excited to understand uh you
 

20419
06:42:09,600 --> 06:42:11,030
also quite excited to understand uh you
know do these scaling laws continue like

20420
06:42:11,030 --> 06:42:11,040
know do these scaling laws continue like
 

20421
06:42:11,040 --> 06:42:13,388
know do these scaling laws continue like
as you scale Channel count how much

20422
06:42:13,388 --> 06:42:13,398
as you scale Channel count how much
 

20423
06:42:13,398 --> 06:42:15,590
as you scale Channel count how much
further out do you go before that

20424
06:42:15,590 --> 06:42:15,600
further out do you go before that
 

20425
06:42:15,600 --> 06:42:17,590
further out do you go before that
saturation point is is truly hit and

20426
06:42:17,590 --> 06:42:17,600
saturation point is is truly hit and
 

20427
06:42:17,600 --> 06:42:19,110
saturation point is is truly hit and
it's not obvious today I think we only

20428
06:42:19,110 --> 06:42:19,120
it's not obvious today I think we only
 

20429
06:42:19,120 --> 06:42:20,468
it's not obvious today I think we only
know what's in the sort of interpolation

20430
06:42:20,468 --> 06:42:20,478
know what's in the sort of interpolation
 

20431
06:42:20,478 --> 06:42:21,788
know what's in the sort of interpolation
space we only know what's between Z and

20432
06:42:21,788 --> 06:42:21,798
space we only know what's between Z and
 

20433
06:42:21,798 --> 06:42:23,670
space we only know what's between Z and
1024 but we don't know what's beyond

20434
06:42:23,670 --> 06:42:23,680
1024 but we don't know what's beyond
 

20435
06:42:23,680 --> 06:42:25,948
1024 but we don't know what's beyond
that um and then there's a whole sort of

20436
06:42:25,948 --> 06:42:25,958
that um and then there's a whole sort of
 

20437
06:42:25,958 --> 06:42:27,190
that um and then there's a whole sort of
like range of interesting sort of

20438
06:42:27,190 --> 06:42:27,200
like range of interesting sort of
 

20439
06:42:27,200 --> 06:42:28,388
like range of interesting sort of
Neuroscience and brain questions which

20440
06:42:28,388 --> 06:42:28,398
Neuroscience and brain questions which
 

20441
06:42:28,398 --> 06:42:29,510
Neuroscience and brain questions which
is when you stick more stuff in the

20442
06:42:29,510 --> 06:42:29,520
is when you stick more stuff in the
 

20443
06:42:29,520 --> 06:42:31,430
is when you stick more stuff in the
brain in more places you get to learn

20444
06:42:31,430 --> 06:42:31,440
brain in more places you get to learn
 

20445
06:42:31,440 --> 06:42:33,150
brain in more places you get to learn
much more quickly about what those brain

20446
06:42:33,150 --> 06:42:33,160
much more quickly about what those brain
 

20447
06:42:33,160 --> 06:42:35,350
much more quickly about what those brain
regions represent and so I'm excited

20448
06:42:35,350 --> 06:42:35,360
regions represent and so I'm excited
 

20449
06:42:35,360 --> 06:42:36,510
regions represent and so I'm excited
about that fundamental Neuroscience

20450
06:42:36,510 --> 06:42:36,520
about that fundamental Neuroscience
 

20451
06:42:36,520 --> 06:42:38,468
about that fundamental Neuroscience
learning which is also important for

20452
06:42:38,468 --> 06:42:38,478
learning which is also important for
 

20453
06:42:38,478 --> 06:42:40,430
learning which is also important for
figuring out how and to most efficiently

20454
06:42:40,430 --> 06:42:40,440
figuring out how and to most efficiently
 

20455
06:42:40,440 --> 06:42:42,830
figuring out how and to most efficiently
insert electrodes in the future so yeah

20456
06:42:42,830 --> 06:42:42,840
insert electrodes in the future so yeah
 

20457
06:42:42,840 --> 06:42:44,388
insert electrodes in the future so yeah
I think all those Dimensions I'm really

20458
06:42:44,388 --> 06:42:44,398
I think all those Dimensions I'm really
 

20459
06:42:44,398 --> 06:42:45,230
I think all those Dimensions I'm really
really excited about and that doesn't

20460
06:42:45,230 --> 06:42:45,240
really excited about and that doesn't
 

20461
06:42:45,240 --> 06:42:46,510
really excited about and that doesn't
even get close to touching the sort of

20462
06:42:46,510 --> 06:42:46,520
even get close to touching the sort of
 

20463
06:42:46,520 --> 06:42:47,788
even get close to touching the sort of
software stack that we work on every

20464
06:42:47,788 --> 06:42:47,798
software stack that we work on every
 

20465
06:42:47,798 --> 06:42:48,948
software stack that we work on every
single day and what we're working on

20466
06:42:48,948 --> 06:42:48,958
single day and what we're working on
 

20467
06:42:48,958 --> 06:42:52,270
single day and what we're working on
right now yeah it uh seems virtually

20468
06:42:52,270 --> 06:42:52,280
right now yeah it uh seems virtually
 

20469
06:42:52,280 --> 06:42:56,230
right now yeah it uh seems virtually
impossible to me that uh a thousand

20470
06:42:56,230 --> 06:42:56,240
impossible to me that uh a thousand
 

20471
06:42:56,240 --> 06:42:58,830
impossible to me that uh a thousand
electrodes is where it saturates it

20472
06:42:58,830 --> 06:42:58,840
electrodes is where it saturates it
 

20473
06:42:58,840 --> 06:43:01,510
electrodes is where it saturates it
feels like this would be one of those uh

20474
06:43:01,510 --> 06:43:01,520
feels like this would be one of those uh
 

20475
06:43:01,520 --> 06:43:03,468
feels like this would be one of those uh
silly Notions in the future where

20476
06:43:03,468 --> 06:43:03,478
silly Notions in the future where
 

20477
06:43:03,478 --> 06:43:05,030
silly Notions in the future where
obviously you should have millions of

20478
06:43:05,030 --> 06:43:05,040
obviously you should have millions of
 

20479
06:43:05,040 --> 06:43:07,070
obviously you should have millions of
electrodes and this and this is where

20480
06:43:07,070 --> 06:43:07,080
electrodes and this and this is where
 

20481
06:43:07,080 --> 06:43:10,750
electrodes and this and this is where
like the true breakthroughs happen yeah

20482
06:43:10,750 --> 06:43:10,760
like the true breakthroughs happen yeah
 

20483
06:43:10,760 --> 06:43:15,110
like the true breakthroughs happen yeah
uh you tweeted oh some thoughts are most

20484
06:43:15,110 --> 06:43:15,120
uh you tweeted oh some thoughts are most
 

20485
06:43:15,120 --> 06:43:18,070
uh you tweeted oh some thoughts are most
precisely described in poetry why do you

20486
06:43:18,070 --> 06:43:18,080
precisely described in poetry why do you
 

20487
06:43:18,080 --> 06:43:19,070
precisely described in poetry why do you
think that

20488
06:43:19,070 --> 06:43:19,080
think that
 

20489
06:43:19,080 --> 06:43:21,990
think that
is I think it's because the the

20490
06:43:21,990 --> 06:43:22,000
is I think it's because the the
 

20491
06:43:22,000 --> 06:43:24,670
is I think it's because the the
information bottleneck of language

20492
06:43:24,670 --> 06:43:24,680
information bottleneck of language
 

20493
06:43:24,680 --> 06:43:27,350
information bottleneck of language
is uh pretty

20494
06:43:27,350 --> 06:43:27,360
is uh pretty
 

20495
06:43:27,360 --> 06:43:29,910
is uh pretty
steep and yet you're like you're able to

20496
06:43:29,910 --> 06:43:29,920
steep and yet you're like you're able to
 

20497
06:43:29,920 --> 06:43:31,628
steep and yet you're like you're able to
reconstruct on the other person's in the

20498
06:43:31,628 --> 06:43:31,638
reconstruct on the other person's in the
 

20499
06:43:31,638 --> 06:43:34,270
reconstruct on the other person's in the
other person's brain more effectively

20500
06:43:34,270 --> 06:43:34,280
other person's brain more effectively
 

20501
06:43:34,280 --> 06:43:36,230
other person's brain more effectively
without being literal like if you if you

20502
06:43:36,230 --> 06:43:36,240
without being literal like if you if you
 

20503
06:43:36,240 --> 06:43:37,590
without being literal like if you if you
can express a sentiment such that in

20504
06:43:37,590 --> 06:43:37,600
can express a sentiment such that in
 

20505
06:43:37,600 --> 06:43:40,670
can express a sentiment such that in
their brain they can reconstruct the the

20506
06:43:40,670 --> 06:43:40,680
their brain they can reconstruct the the
 

20507
06:43:40,680 --> 06:43:42,750
their brain they can reconstruct the the
actual true underlying meaning and

20508
06:43:42,750 --> 06:43:42,760
actual true underlying meaning and
 

20509
06:43:42,760 --> 06:43:43,868
actual true underlying meaning and
beauty of the thing that you're trying

20510
06:43:43,868 --> 06:43:43,878
beauty of the thing that you're trying
 

20511
06:43:43,878 --> 06:43:46,190
beauty of the thing that you're trying
to get across the S the generator

20512
06:43:46,190 --> 06:43:46,200
to get across the S the generator
 

20513
06:43:46,200 --> 06:43:47,350
to get across the S the generator
function in their brain is more powerful

20514
06:43:47,350 --> 06:43:47,360
function in their brain is more powerful
 

20515
06:43:47,360 --> 06:43:49,270
function in their brain is more powerful
than What language can express and

20516
06:43:49,270 --> 06:43:49,280
than What language can express and
 

20517
06:43:49,280 --> 06:43:52,190
than What language can express and
so the the mechanism of poetry is really

20518
06:43:52,190 --> 06:43:52,200
so the the mechanism of poetry is really
 

20519
06:43:52,200 --> 06:43:55,510
so the the mechanism of poetry is really
just to uh feed or seed that generator

20520
06:43:55,510 --> 06:43:55,520
just to uh feed or seed that generator
 

20521
06:43:55,520 --> 06:43:59,110
just to uh feed or seed that generator
function so being literal sometimes is a

20522
06:43:59,110 --> 06:43:59,120
function so being literal sometimes is a
 

20523
06:43:59,120 --> 06:44:00,910
function so being literal sometimes is a
suboptimal compression for the for the

20524
06:44:00,910 --> 06:44:00,920
suboptimal compression for the for the
 

20525
06:44:00,920 --> 06:44:03,548
suboptimal compression for the for the
thing you're trying to convey

20526
06:44:03,548 --> 06:44:03,558
thing you're trying to convey
 

20527
06:44:03,558 --> 06:44:04,830
thing you're trying to convey
and it's actually in the process of the

20528
06:44:04,830 --> 06:44:04,840
and it's actually in the process of the
 

20529
06:44:04,840 --> 06:44:06,388
and it's actually in the process of the
user going through that generation that

20530
06:44:06,388 --> 06:44:06,398
user going through that generation that
 

20531
06:44:06,398 --> 06:44:08,468
user going through that generation that
they understand what what you mean like

20532
06:44:08,468 --> 06:44:08,478
they understand what what you mean like
 

20533
06:44:08,478 --> 06:44:09,750
they understand what what you mean like
that's the that's the beautiful part

20534
06:44:09,750 --> 06:44:09,760
that's the that's the beautiful part
 

20535
06:44:09,760 --> 06:44:10,670
that's the that's the beautiful part
it's also like when you look at a

20536
06:44:10,670 --> 06:44:10,680
it's also like when you look at a
 

20537
06:44:10,680 --> 06:44:13,030
it's also like when you look at a
beautiful painting like it's not the the

20538
06:44:13,030 --> 06:44:13,040
beautiful painting like it's not the the
 

20539
06:44:13,040 --> 06:44:14,070
beautiful painting like it's not the the
pixels of the painting that are

20540
06:44:14,070 --> 06:44:14,080
pixels of the painting that are
 

20541
06:44:14,080 --> 06:44:15,548
pixels of the painting that are
beautiful it's the thought process that

20542
06:44:15,548 --> 06:44:15,558
beautiful it's the thought process that
 

20543
06:44:15,558 --> 06:44:17,190
beautiful it's the thought process that
occurs when you see that the the

20544
06:44:17,190 --> 06:44:17,200
occurs when you see that the the
 

20545
06:44:17,200 --> 06:44:18,990
occurs when you see that the the
experience of that that actually is a

20546
06:44:18,990 --> 06:44:19,000
experience of that that actually is a
 

20547
06:44:19,000 --> 06:44:20,708
experience of that that actually is a
thing that matters yeah it's resonating

20548
06:44:20,708 --> 06:44:20,718
thing that matters yeah it's resonating
 

20549
06:44:20,718 --> 06:44:22,510
thing that matters yeah it's resonating
with some deep

20550
06:44:22,510 --> 06:44:22,520
with some deep
 

20551
06:44:22,520 --> 06:44:25,510
with some deep
yeah thing within you that the artist

20552
06:44:25,510 --> 06:44:25,520
yeah thing within you that the artist
 

20553
06:44:25,520 --> 06:44:27,628
yeah thing within you that the artist
also experienced and was able to convey

20554
06:44:27,628 --> 06:44:27,638
also experienced and was able to convey
 

20555
06:44:27,638 --> 06:44:29,750
also experienced and was able to convey
that through the pixels and that's

20556
06:44:29,750 --> 06:44:29,760
that through the pixels and that's
 

20557
06:44:29,760 --> 06:44:31,310
that through the pixels and that's
actually going to be relevant for for

20558
06:44:31,310 --> 06:44:31,320
actually going to be relevant for for
 

20559
06:44:31,320 --> 06:44:33,948
actually going to be relevant for for
for fullon telepathy

20560
06:44:33,948 --> 06:44:33,958
for fullon telepathy
 

20561
06:44:33,958 --> 06:44:35,948
for fullon telepathy
you know it's like if you just read the

20562
06:44:35,948 --> 06:44:35,958
you know it's like if you just read the
 

20563
06:44:35,958 --> 06:44:37,310
you know it's like if you just read the
Poetry

20564
06:44:37,310 --> 06:44:37,320
Poetry
 

20565
06:44:37,320 --> 06:44:40,270
Poetry
literally that doesn't say much of

20566
06:44:40,270 --> 06:44:40,280
literally that doesn't say much of
 

20567
06:44:40,280 --> 06:44:43,150
literally that doesn't say much of
anything interesting it requires a human

20568
06:44:43,150 --> 06:44:43,160
anything interesting it requires a human
 

20569
06:44:43,160 --> 06:44:44,708
anything interesting it requires a human
to interpret

20570
06:44:44,708 --> 06:44:44,718
to interpret
 

20571
06:44:44,718 --> 06:44:47,350
to interpret
it so it's the combination of the human

20572
06:44:47,350 --> 06:44:47,360
it so it's the combination of the human
 

20573
06:44:47,360 --> 06:44:49,590
it so it's the combination of the human
mind and all the experiences that a

20574
06:44:49,590 --> 06:44:49,600
mind and all the experiences that a
 

20575
06:44:49,600 --> 06:44:51,948
mind and all the experiences that a
human being has within the context of

20576
06:44:51,948 --> 06:44:51,958
human being has within the context of
 

20577
06:44:51,958 --> 06:44:53,628
human being has within the context of
the collective intelligence of the human

20578
06:44:53,628 --> 06:44:53,638
the collective intelligence of the human
 

20579
06:44:53,638 --> 06:44:56,628
the collective intelligence of the human
species that makes that poem make sense

20580
06:44:56,628 --> 06:44:56,638
species that makes that poem make sense
 

20581
06:44:56,638 --> 06:44:59,388
species that makes that poem make sense
and they load that in and so in that

20582
06:44:59,388 --> 06:44:59,398
and they load that in and so in that
 

20583
06:44:59,398 --> 06:45:01,670
and they load that in and so in that
same way the signal that carries from

20584
06:45:01,670 --> 06:45:01,680
same way the signal that carries from
 

20585
06:45:01,680 --> 06:45:04,948
same way the signal that carries from
Human to Human uh meaning might not may

20586
06:45:04,948 --> 06:45:04,958
Human to Human uh meaning might not may
 

20587
06:45:04,958 --> 06:45:07,708
Human to Human uh meaning might not may
seem trivial but may actually carry a

20588
06:45:07,708 --> 06:45:07,718
seem trivial but may actually carry a
 

20589
06:45:07,718 --> 06:45:09,468
seem trivial but may actually carry a
lot of

20590
06:45:09,468 --> 06:45:09,478
lot of
 

20591
06:45:09,478 --> 06:45:13,350
lot of
power uh because of the complexity of

20592
06:45:13,350 --> 06:45:13,360
power uh because of the complexity of
 

20593
06:45:13,360 --> 06:45:15,948
power uh because of the complexity of
the human mind and the receiving

20594
06:45:15,948 --> 06:45:15,958
the human mind and the receiving
 

20595
06:45:15,958 --> 06:45:19,070
the human mind and the receiving
end yeah that's interesting I poetry

20596
06:45:19,070 --> 06:45:19,080
end yeah that's interesting I poetry
 

20597
06:45:19,080 --> 06:45:22,310
end yeah that's interesting I poetry
still doesn't who was it I think uh

20598
06:45:22,310 --> 06:45:22,320
still doesn't who was it I think uh
 

20599
06:45:22,320 --> 06:45:25,190
still doesn't who was it I think uh
Yoshi first said

20600
06:45:25,190 --> 06:45:25,200
Yoshi first said
 

20601
06:45:25,200 --> 06:45:28,628
Yoshi first said
uh uh something

20602
06:45:28,628 --> 06:45:28,638
uh uh something
 

20603
06:45:28,638 --> 06:45:30,830
uh uh something
about all the people that think we've

20604
06:45:30,830 --> 06:45:30,840
about all the people that think we've
 

20605
06:45:30,840 --> 06:45:34,388
about all the people that think we've
achieved AGI EX explain

20606
06:45:34,388 --> 06:45:34,398
achieved AGI EX explain
 

20607
06:45:34,398 --> 06:45:38,590
achieved AGI EX explain
why humans like music oh yeah and and

20608
06:45:38,590 --> 06:45:38,600
why humans like music oh yeah and and
 

20609
06:45:38,600 --> 06:45:43,110
why humans like music oh yeah and and
until until the AGI Likes music you

20610
06:45:43,110 --> 06:45:43,120
until until the AGI Likes music you
 

20611
06:45:43,120 --> 06:45:45,030
until until the AGI Likes music you
haven't achieved AGI or something like

20612
06:45:45,030 --> 06:45:45,040
haven't achieved AGI or something like
 

20613
06:45:45,040 --> 06:45:46,190
haven't achieved AGI or something like
do you not think that's like some next

20614
06:45:46,190 --> 06:45:46,200
do you not think that's like some next
 

20615
06:45:46,200 --> 06:45:48,468
do you not think that's like some next
token entropy surprise kind of thing

20616
06:45:48,468 --> 06:45:48,478
token entropy surprise kind of thing
 

20617
06:45:48,478 --> 06:45:50,150
token entropy surprise kind of thing
going on there I don't know I don't know

20618
06:45:50,150 --> 06:45:50,160
going on there I don't know I don't know
 

20619
06:45:50,160 --> 06:45:52,230
going on there I don't know I don't know
either I I listen to a lot of classical

20620
06:45:52,230 --> 06:45:52,240
either I I listen to a lot of classical
 

20621
06:45:52,240 --> 06:45:54,510
either I I listen to a lot of classical
music and also read a lot of poetry and

20622
06:45:54,510 --> 06:45:54,520
music and also read a lot of poetry and
 

20623
06:45:54,520 --> 06:45:57,070
music and also read a lot of poetry and
uh yeah I do wonder if like there is

20624
06:45:57,070 --> 06:45:57,080
uh yeah I do wonder if like there is
 

20625
06:45:57,080 --> 06:45:58,750
uh yeah I do wonder if like there is
some element of the next token surprise

20626
06:45:58,750 --> 06:45:58,760
some element of the next token surprise
 

20627
06:45:58,760 --> 06:46:00,548
some element of the next token surprise
Factor going on there yeah maybe cuz I

20628
06:46:00,548 --> 06:46:00,558
Factor going on there yeah maybe cuz I
 

20629
06:46:00,558 --> 06:46:02,110
Factor going on there yeah maybe cuz I
mean like a lot of the the tricks in

20630
06:46:02,110 --> 06:46:02,120
mean like a lot of the the tricks in
 

20631
06:46:02,120 --> 06:46:03,628
mean like a lot of the the tricks in
both poetry and music are like basically

20632
06:46:03,628 --> 06:46:03,638
both poetry and music are like basically
 

20633
06:46:03,638 --> 06:46:04,910
both poetry and music are like basically
you have some repeated structure and

20634
06:46:04,910 --> 06:46:04,920
you have some repeated structure and
 

20635
06:46:04,920 --> 06:46:06,628
you have some repeated structure and
then you do like a Twist like it's like

20636
06:46:06,628 --> 06:46:06,638
then you do like a Twist like it's like
 

20637
06:46:06,638 --> 06:46:08,948
then you do like a Twist like it's like
okay verse or like Clause 1 2 3 is one

20638
06:46:08,948 --> 06:46:08,958
okay verse or like Clause 1 2 3 is one
 

20639
06:46:08,958 --> 06:46:10,468
okay verse or like Clause 1 2 3 is one
thing and then Clause 4 is like okay now

20640
06:46:10,468 --> 06:46:10,478
thing and then Clause 4 is like okay now
 

20641
06:46:10,478 --> 06:46:12,510
thing and then Clause 4 is like okay now
we're on the next theme yeah and they

20642
06:46:12,510 --> 06:46:12,520
we're on the next theme yeah and they
 

20643
06:46:12,520 --> 06:46:13,750
we're on the next theme yeah and they
kind of play with exactly when the

20644
06:46:13,750 --> 06:46:13,760
kind of play with exactly when the
 

20645
06:46:13,760 --> 06:46:15,310
kind of play with exactly when the
surprise happens and the expectations of

20646
06:46:15,310 --> 06:46:15,320
surprise happens and the expectations of
 

20647
06:46:15,320 --> 06:46:17,468
surprise happens and the expectations of
the user and that's even true like

20648
06:46:17,468 --> 06:46:17,478
the user and that's even true like
 

20649
06:46:17,478 --> 06:46:19,510
the user and that's even true like
through history as musicians evolve

20650
06:46:19,510 --> 06:46:19,520
through history as musicians evolve
 

20651
06:46:19,520 --> 06:46:21,230
through history as musicians evolve
music they take like some know and

20652
06:46:21,230 --> 06:46:21,240
music they take like some know and
 

20653
06:46:21,240 --> 06:46:22,788
music they take like some know and
structure that people are familiar with

20654
06:46:22,788 --> 06:46:22,798
structure that people are familiar with
 

20655
06:46:22,798 --> 06:46:24,310
structure that people are familiar with
and they just tweak it a little bit like

20656
06:46:24,310 --> 06:46:24,320
and they just tweak it a little bit like
 

20657
06:46:24,320 --> 06:46:25,510
and they just tweak it a little bit like
they tweak it and add a surprising

20658
06:46:25,510 --> 06:46:25,520
they tweak it and add a surprising
 

20659
06:46:25,520 --> 06:46:27,230
they tweak it and add a surprising
element this is especially true in like

20660
06:46:27,230 --> 06:46:27,240
element this is especially true in like
 

20661
06:46:27,240 --> 06:46:29,110
element this is especially true in like
in classical music Heritage but that's

20662
06:46:29,110 --> 06:46:29,120
in classical music Heritage but that's
 

20663
06:46:29,120 --> 06:46:29,990
in classical music Heritage but that's
what I'm Wonder like is it all just

20664
06:46:29,990 --> 06:46:30,000
what I'm Wonder like is it all just
 

20665
06:46:30,000 --> 06:46:32,910
what I'm Wonder like is it all just
entropy like the the uh so so bra so

20666
06:46:32,910 --> 06:46:32,920
entropy like the the uh so so bra so
 

20667
06:46:32,920 --> 06:46:34,910
entropy like the the uh so so bra so
breaking structure or breaking symmetry

20668
06:46:34,910 --> 06:46:34,920
breaking structure or breaking symmetry
 

20669
06:46:34,920 --> 06:46:36,468
breaking structure or breaking symmetry
is something that humans seem to like

20670
06:46:36,468 --> 06:46:36,478
is something that humans seem to like
 

20671
06:46:36,478 --> 06:46:38,350
is something that humans seem to like
maybe as simple as that yeah and I mean

20672
06:46:38,350 --> 06:46:38,360
maybe as simple as that yeah and I mean
 

20673
06:46:38,360 --> 06:46:41,270
maybe as simple as that yeah and I mean
great artists copy uh and they also you

20674
06:46:41,270 --> 06:46:41,280
great artists copy uh and they also you
 

20675
06:46:41,280 --> 06:46:42,708
great artists copy uh and they also you
know knowing which rules to break is the

20676
06:46:42,708 --> 06:46:42,718
know knowing which rules to break is the
 

20677
06:46:42,718 --> 06:46:44,990
know knowing which rules to break is the
important part and that fundamentally it

20678
06:46:44,990 --> 06:46:45,000
important part and that fundamentally it
 

20679
06:46:45,000 --> 06:46:46,948
important part and that fundamentally it
must be about the The Listener of the

20680
06:46:46,948 --> 06:46:46,958
must be about the The Listener of the
 

20681
06:46:46,958 --> 06:46:48,750
must be about the The Listener of the
piece like which rulle is the right one

20682
06:46:48,750 --> 06:46:48,760
piece like which rulle is the right one
 

20683
06:46:48,760 --> 06:46:50,430
piece like which rulle is the right one
to break is about the user or the

20684
06:46:50,430 --> 06:46:50,440
to break is about the user or the
 

20685
06:46:50,440 --> 06:46:52,910
to break is about the user or the
audience member perceiving that as

20686
06:46:52,910 --> 06:46:52,920
audience member perceiving that as
 

20687
06:46:52,920 --> 06:46:54,750
audience member perceiving that as
interesting uh what do you think is the

20688
06:46:54,750 --> 06:46:54,760
interesting uh what do you think is the
 

20689
06:46:54,760 --> 06:46:59,230
interesting uh what do you think is the
meaning of human

20690
06:46:59,230 --> 06:46:59,240

 

20691
06:46:59,240 --> 06:47:01,468

existence there's a TV show I really

20692
06:47:01,468 --> 06:47:01,478
existence there's a TV show I really
 

20693
06:47:01,478 --> 06:47:03,590
existence there's a TV show I really
like called The West Wing

20694
06:47:03,590 --> 06:47:03,600
like called The West Wing
 

20695
06:47:03,600 --> 06:47:05,388
like called The West Wing
and in uh In The West Wing there's a

20696
06:47:05,388 --> 06:47:05,398
and in uh In The West Wing there's a
 

20697
06:47:05,398 --> 06:47:06,388
and in uh In The West Wing there's a
character he's the president of the

20698
06:47:06,388 --> 06:47:06,398
character he's the president of the
 

20699
06:47:06,398 --> 06:47:08,190
character he's the president of the
United States who's uh having a

20700
06:47:08,190 --> 06:47:08,200
United States who's uh having a
 

20701
06:47:08,200 --> 06:47:09,910
United States who's uh having a
discussion about the Bible with one of

20702
06:47:09,910 --> 06:47:09,920
discussion about the Bible with one of
 

20703
06:47:09,920 --> 06:47:11,030
discussion about the Bible with one of
their

20704
06:47:11,030 --> 06:47:11,040
their
 

20705
06:47:11,040 --> 06:47:14,590
their
colleagues and uh the colleague says

20706
06:47:14,590 --> 06:47:14,600
colleagues and uh the colleague says
 

20707
06:47:14,600 --> 06:47:15,830
colleagues and uh the colleague says
something about you know the Bible says

20708
06:47:15,830 --> 06:47:15,840
something about you know the Bible says
 

20709
06:47:15,840 --> 06:47:18,990
something about you know the Bible says
X Y and Z and uh the President says yeah

20710
06:47:18,990 --> 06:47:19,000
X Y and Z and uh the President says yeah
 

20711
06:47:19,000 --> 06:47:23,230
X Y and Z and uh the President says yeah
but it also says ABC and the person says

20712
06:47:23,230 --> 06:47:23,240
but it also says ABC and the person says
 

20713
06:47:23,240 --> 06:47:24,270
but it also says ABC and the person says
well do you believe the Bible to be

20714
06:47:24,270 --> 06:47:24,280
well do you believe the Bible to be
 

20715
06:47:24,280 --> 06:47:26,750
well do you believe the Bible to be
literally true and the President

20716
06:47:26,750 --> 06:47:26,760
literally true and the President
 

20717
06:47:26,760 --> 06:47:28,948
literally true and the President
says yes but I also think that neither

20718
06:47:28,948 --> 06:47:28,958
says yes but I also think that neither
 

20719
06:47:28,958 --> 06:47:31,150
says yes but I also think that neither
of us are smart enough to understand

20720
06:47:31,150 --> 06:47:31,160
of us are smart enough to understand
 

20721
06:47:31,160 --> 06:47:33,990
of us are smart enough to understand
it I think to like the analogy here for

20722
06:47:33,990 --> 06:47:34,000
it I think to like the analogy here for
 

20723
06:47:34,000 --> 06:47:36,150
it I think to like the analogy here for
the meaning of life is that largely we

20724
06:47:36,150 --> 06:47:36,160
the meaning of life is that largely we
 

20725
06:47:36,160 --> 06:47:38,110
the meaning of life is that largely we
don't know the right question to ask and

20726
06:47:38,110 --> 06:47:38,120
don't know the right question to ask and
 

20727
06:47:38,120 --> 06:47:41,868
don't know the right question to ask and
so I'm I think I'm very aligned with uh

20728
06:47:41,868 --> 06:47:41,878
so I'm I think I'm very aligned with uh
 

20729
06:47:41,878 --> 06:47:42,830
so I'm I think I'm very aligned with uh
sort of The

20730
06:47:42,830 --> 06:47:42,840
sort of The
 

20731
06:47:42,840 --> 06:47:44,830
sort of The
Hitchhiker's guided the Galaxy version

20732
06:47:44,830 --> 06:47:44,840
Hitchhiker's guided the Galaxy version
 

20733
06:47:44,840 --> 06:47:46,230
Hitchhiker's guided the Galaxy version
of this question which is basically if

20734
06:47:46,230 --> 06:47:46,240
of this question which is basically if
 

20735
06:47:46,240 --> 06:47:48,310
of this question which is basically if
we can ask the right

20736
06:47:48,310 --> 06:47:48,320
we can ask the right
 

20737
06:47:48,320 --> 06:47:50,388
we can ask the right
questions it's much more likely we find

20738
06:47:50,388 --> 06:47:50,398
questions it's much more likely we find
 

20739
06:47:50,398 --> 06:47:52,590
questions it's much more likely we find
the meaning of human existence and so in

20740
06:47:52,590 --> 06:47:52,600
the meaning of human existence and so in
 

20741
06:47:52,600 --> 06:47:55,070
the meaning of human existence and so in
the short term as a heuristic in the

20742
06:47:55,070 --> 06:47:55,080
the short term as a heuristic in the
 

20743
06:47:55,080 --> 06:47:56,548
the short term as a heuristic in the
sort of search policy space we should

20744
06:47:56,548 --> 06:47:56,558
sort of search policy space we should
 

20745
06:47:56,558 --> 06:47:59,510
sort of search policy space we should
try to increase the diversity of uh

20746
06:47:59,510 --> 06:47:59,520
try to increase the diversity of uh
 

20747
06:47:59,520 --> 06:48:00,868
try to increase the diversity of uh
people asking such questions or

20748
06:48:00,868 --> 06:48:00,878
people asking such questions or
 

20749
06:48:00,878 --> 06:48:02,510
people asking such questions or
generally of Consciousness and conscious

20750
06:48:02,510 --> 06:48:02,520
generally of Consciousness and conscious
 

20751
06:48:02,520 --> 06:48:04,030
generally of Consciousness and conscious
being asking such

20752
06:48:04,030 --> 06:48:04,040
being asking such
 

20753
06:48:04,040 --> 06:48:06,628
being asking such
questions um so again I think I'll take

20754
06:48:06,628 --> 06:48:06,638
questions um so again I think I'll take
 

20755
06:48:06,638 --> 06:48:08,430
questions um so again I think I'll take
the I don't know card here but say I do

20756
06:48:08,430 --> 06:48:08,440
the I don't know card here but say I do
 

20757
06:48:08,440 --> 06:48:09,868
the I don't know card here but say I do
think there are meaningful things we can

20758
06:48:09,868 --> 06:48:09,878
think there are meaningful things we can
 

20759
06:48:09,878 --> 06:48:11,350
think there are meaningful things we can
do that improve the likelihood of

20760
06:48:11,350 --> 06:48:11,360
do that improve the likelihood of
 

20761
06:48:11,360 --> 06:48:14,150
do that improve the likelihood of
answering that question it's interesting

20762
06:48:14,150 --> 06:48:14,160
answering that question it's interesting
 

20763
06:48:14,160 --> 06:48:17,150
answering that question it's interesting
how much value you assign to the task of

20764
06:48:17,150 --> 06:48:17,160
how much value you assign to the task of
 

20765
06:48:17,160 --> 06:48:18,510
how much value you assign to the task of
asking the right

20766
06:48:18,510 --> 06:48:18,520
asking the right
 

20767
06:48:18,520 --> 06:48:20,388
asking the right
questions that's

20768
06:48:20,388 --> 06:48:20,398
questions that's
 

20769
06:48:20,398 --> 06:48:22,788
questions that's
the that's the main thing it's not the

20770
06:48:22,788 --> 06:48:22,798
the that's the main thing it's not the
 

20771
06:48:22,798 --> 06:48:25,150
the that's the main thing it's not the
answers is the questions this point by

20772
06:48:25,150 --> 06:48:25,160
answers is the questions this point by
 

20773
06:48:25,160 --> 06:48:26,628
answers is the questions this point by
the way is driven

20774
06:48:26,628 --> 06:48:26,638
the way is driven
 

20775
06:48:26,638 --> 06:48:28,868
the way is driven
home uh in a very painful way when you

20776
06:48:28,868 --> 06:48:28,878
home uh in a very painful way when you
 

20777
06:48:28,878 --> 06:48:30,150
home uh in a very painful way when you
try to communicate with someone who

20778
06:48:30,150 --> 06:48:30,160
try to communicate with someone who
 

20779
06:48:30,160 --> 06:48:32,788
try to communicate with someone who
cannot speak because a lot of the time

20780
06:48:32,788 --> 06:48:32,798
cannot speak because a lot of the time
 

20781
06:48:32,798 --> 06:48:33,868
cannot speak because a lot of the time
the last thing to go is they have the

20782
06:48:33,868 --> 06:48:33,878
the last thing to go is they have the
 

20783
06:48:33,878 --> 06:48:35,830
the last thing to go is they have the
ability to somehow you know wiggle a lip

20784
06:48:35,830 --> 06:48:35,840
ability to somehow you know wiggle a lip
 

20785
06:48:35,840 --> 06:48:37,190
ability to somehow you know wiggle a lip
or move something that allows them to

20786
06:48:37,190 --> 06:48:37,200
or move something that allows them to
 

20787
06:48:37,200 --> 06:48:40,230
or move something that allows them to
say yes or no and in that situation it's

20788
06:48:40,230 --> 06:48:40,240
say yes or no and in that situation it's
 

20789
06:48:40,240 --> 06:48:42,230
say yes or no and in that situation it's
very obvious that what matters is are

20790
06:48:42,230 --> 06:48:42,240
very obvious that what matters is are
 

20791
06:48:42,240 --> 06:48:43,708
very obvious that what matters is are
you asking them the right question to be

20792
06:48:43,708 --> 06:48:43,718
you asking them the right question to be
 

20793
06:48:43,718 --> 06:48:46,548
you asking them the right question to be
able to say yes or no to wow that's

20794
06:48:46,548 --> 06:48:46,558
able to say yes or no to wow that's
 

20795
06:48:46,558 --> 06:48:49,510
able to say yes or no to wow that's

07:09:07,478 --> 07:09:09,830
had to amputate both your legs and we
just do very mean things to her all the

21700
07:09:09,830 --> 07:09:09,840
just do very mean things to her all the
 

21701
07:09:09,840 --> 07:09:13,628
just do very mean things to her all the
time um I'm so surprised that she still

21702
07:09:13,628 --> 07:09:13,638
time um I'm so surprised that she still
 

21703
07:09:13,638 --> 07:09:17,430
time um I'm so surprised that she still
loves us um but right after surgery I

21704
07:09:17,430 --> 07:09:17,440
loves us um but right after surgery I
 

21705
07:09:17,440 --> 07:09:19,070
loves us um but right after surgery I
was really worried that I was going to

21706
07:09:19,070 --> 07:09:19,080
was really worried that I was going to
 

21707
07:09:19,080 --> 07:09:22,110
was really worried that I was going to
be too like groggy like not all there I

21708
07:09:22,110 --> 07:09:22,120
be too like groggy like not all there I
 

21709
07:09:22,120 --> 07:09:26,070
be too like groggy like not all there I
had had anesthesia once before and it it

21710
07:09:26,070 --> 07:09:26,080
had had anesthesia once before and it it
 

21711
07:09:26,080 --> 07:09:28,990
had had anesthesia once before and it it
messed me up like I could not function

21712
07:09:28,990 --> 07:09:29,000
messed me up like I could not function
 

21713
07:09:29,000 --> 07:09:31,948
messed me up like I could not function
um for a while afterwards and I

21714
07:09:31,948 --> 07:09:31,958
um for a while afterwards and I
 

21715
07:09:31,958 --> 07:09:34,990
um for a while afterwards and I
um I like said a lot of things that I

21716
07:09:34,990 --> 07:09:35,000
um I like said a lot of things that I
 

21717
07:09:35,000 --> 07:09:36,628
um I like said a lot of things that I
was like I was really worried that I was

21718
07:09:36,628 --> 07:09:36,638
was like I was really worried that I was
 

21719
07:09:36,638 --> 07:09:39,548
was like I was really worried that I was
going to start I don't know like

21720
07:09:39,548 --> 07:09:39,558
going to start I don't know like
 

21721
07:09:39,558 --> 07:09:41,868
going to start I don't know like
dropping dropping some bombs and I

21722
07:09:41,868 --> 07:09:41,878
dropping dropping some bombs and I
 

21723
07:09:41,878 --> 07:09:44,468
dropping dropping some bombs and I
wouldn't even know I wouldn't remember

21724
07:09:44,468 --> 07:09:44,478
wouldn't even know I wouldn't remember
 

21725
07:09:44,478 --> 07:09:47,190
wouldn't even know I wouldn't remember
um so I was like like please God don't

21726
07:09:47,190 --> 07:09:47,200
um so I was like like please God don't
 

21727
07:09:47,200 --> 07:09:50,070
um so I was like like please God don't
let that happen and please let me be

21728
07:09:50,070 --> 07:09:50,080
let that happen and please let me be
 

21729
07:09:50,080 --> 07:09:54,708
let that happen and please let me be
there enough to do this to my mom um and

21730
07:09:54,708 --> 07:09:54,718
there enough to do this to my mom um and
 

21731
07:09:54,718 --> 07:09:58,310
there enough to do this to my mom um and
so she walked in uh after surgery it was

21732
07:09:58,310 --> 07:09:58,320
so she walked in uh after surgery it was
 

21733
07:09:58,320 --> 07:10:00,030
so she walked in uh after surgery it was
like the first time they had been able

21734
07:10:00,030 --> 07:10:00,040
like the first time they had been able
 

21735
07:10:00,040 --> 07:10:01,830
like the first time they had been able
to see me after surgery

21736
07:10:01,830 --> 07:10:01,840
to see me after surgery
 

21737
07:10:01,840 --> 07:10:04,468
to see me after surgery
and she just looked at me she said hi

21738
07:10:04,468 --> 07:10:04,478
and she just looked at me she said hi
 

21739
07:10:04,478 --> 07:10:06,110
and she just looked at me she said hi
like how are you how are you doing how

21740
07:10:06,110 --> 07:10:06,120
like how are you how are you doing how
 

21741
07:10:06,120 --> 07:10:08,628
like how are you how are you doing how
do you feel and I looked at her and just

21742
07:10:08,628 --> 07:10:08,638
do you feel and I looked at her and just
 

21743
07:10:08,638 --> 07:10:10,750
do you feel and I looked at her and just
this very I think the anesthesia helped

21744
07:10:10,750 --> 07:10:10,760
this very I think the anesthesia helped
 

21745
07:10:10,760 --> 07:10:12,830
this very I think the anesthesia helped
very like groggy sort of confused look

21746
07:10:12,830 --> 07:10:12,840
very like groggy sort of confused look
 

21747
07:10:12,840 --> 07:10:16,868
very like groggy sort of confused look
on my face it's like who who are you and

21748
07:10:16,868 --> 07:10:16,878
on my face it's like who who are you and
 

21749
07:10:16,878 --> 07:10:19,430
on my face it's like who who are you and
she just started looking around the room

21750
07:10:19,430 --> 07:10:19,440
she just started looking around the room
 

21751
07:10:19,440 --> 07:10:21,670
she just started looking around the room
like at the surgeons at the doctors like

21752
07:10:21,670 --> 07:10:21,680
like at the surgeons at the doctors like
 

21753
07:10:21,680 --> 07:10:23,430
like at the surgeons at the doctors like
what did you do to my son like you need

21754
07:10:23,430 --> 07:10:23,440
what did you do to my son like you need
 

21755
07:10:23,440 --> 07:10:25,590
what did you do to my son like you need
to fix this right now tear started

21756
07:10:25,590 --> 07:10:25,600
to fix this right now tear started
 

21757
07:10:25,600 --> 07:10:27,430
to fix this right now tear started
streaming I saw how much she was

21758
07:10:27,430 --> 07:10:27,440
streaming I saw how much she was
 

21759
07:10:27,440 --> 07:10:29,270
streaming I saw how much she was
freaking out I was like I can't let this

21760
07:10:29,270 --> 07:10:29,280
freaking out I was like I can't let this
 

21761
07:10:29,280 --> 07:10:32,070
freaking out I was like I can't let this
go on and so I was like Mom Mom I'm fine

21762
07:10:32,070 --> 07:10:32,080
go on and so I was like Mom Mom I'm fine
 

21763
07:10:32,080 --> 07:10:35,788
go on and so I was like Mom Mom I'm fine
like uh it's all right and uh still she

21764
07:10:35,788 --> 07:10:35,798
like uh it's all right and uh still she
 

21765
07:10:35,798 --> 07:10:39,510
like uh it's all right and uh still she
was not happy about it she uh still says

21766
07:10:39,510 --> 07:10:39,520
was not happy about it she uh still says
 

21767
07:10:39,520 --> 07:10:41,750
was not happy about it she uh still says
she's going to get me back someday but I

21768
07:10:41,750 --> 07:10:41,760
she's going to get me back someday but I
 

21769
07:10:41,760 --> 07:10:43,750
she's going to get me back someday but I
mean I I don't know I don't know what

21770
07:10:43,750 --> 07:10:43,760
mean I I don't know I don't know what

that's going to look like it's a

21772
07:10:45,150 --> 07:10:45,160
that's going to look like it's a
 

21773
07:10:45,160 --> 07:10:47,590
that's going to look like it's a
lifelong battle Yeah Yeah but it was

lifelong battle Yeah Yeah but it was
good in some sense it was a

good in some sense it was a
 

21777
07:10:48,798 --> 07:10:51,310
good in some sense it was a
demonstration that you still got that's

21778
07:10:51,310 --> 07:10:51,320
demonstration that you still got that's
 

21779
07:10:51,320 --> 07:10:53,110
demonstration that you still got that's

21781
07:10:53,120 --> 07:10:55,070
that's all I wanted to that's all I
wanted it to be and I knew that doing

21782
07:10:55,070 --> 07:10:55,080
wanted it to be and I knew that doing
 

21783
07:10:55,080 --> 07:10:57,750
wanted it to be and I knew that doing
something super mean to her like that

21784
07:10:57,750 --> 07:10:57,760
something super mean to her like that
 

21785
07:10:57,760 --> 07:11:00,670
something super mean to her like that
would show her yeah to show that you're

21786
07:11:00,670 --> 07:11:00,680
would show her yeah to show that you're

you were able to feel that you can use
 

21795
07:11:11,760 --> 07:11:14,910
you were able to feel that you can use
the neuralink device to affect the world

21796
07:11:14,910 --> 07:11:14,920
the neuralink device to affect the world
 

21797
07:11:14,920 --> 07:11:17,788
the neuralink device to affect the world
around you yeah um the first little

21798
07:11:17,788 --> 07:11:17,798
around you yeah um the first little
 

21799
07:11:17,798 --> 07:11:20,350
around you yeah um the first little
taste I got of it was uh actually not

21800
07:11:20,350 --> 07:11:20,360
taste I got of it was uh actually not
 

21801
07:11:20,360 --> 07:11:22,910
taste I got of it was uh actually not
too long after surgery um some of the

21802
07:11:22,910 --> 07:11:22,920
too long after surgery um some of the
 

21803
07:11:22,920 --> 07:11:26,590
too long after surgery um some of the
neuralink team had brought in um like a

21804
07:11:26,590 --> 07:11:26,600
neuralink team had brought in um like a
 

21805
07:11:26,600 --> 07:11:29,990
neuralink team had brought in um like a
little iPad uh a little tablet screen

21806
07:11:29,990 --> 07:11:30,000
little iPad uh a little tablet screen
 

21807
07:11:30,000 --> 07:11:33,548
little iPad uh a little tablet screen
and they' put up eight different um

21808
07:11:33,548 --> 07:11:33,558
and they' put up eight different um
 

21809
07:11:33,558 --> 07:11:36,510
and they' put up eight different um
channels um and that were recording some

21810
07:11:36,510 --> 07:11:36,520
channels um and that were recording some
 

21811
07:11:36,520 --> 07:11:38,750
channels um and that were recording some
of my neuron spikes um and they put it

21812
07:11:38,750 --> 07:11:38,760
of my neuron spikes um and they put it
 

21813
07:11:38,760 --> 07:11:40,150
of my neuron spikes um and they put it
in front of me they're like this is like

21814
07:11:40,150 --> 07:11:40,160
in front of me they're like this is like
 

21815
07:11:40,160 --> 07:11:43,230
in front of me they're like this is like
real time your brain firing I like

21816
07:11:43,230 --> 07:11:43,240
real time your brain firing I like
 

21817
07:11:43,240 --> 07:11:47,110
real time your brain firing I like
that's super cool um my first thought

21818
07:11:47,110 --> 07:11:47,120
that's super cool um my first thought
 

21819
07:11:47,120 --> 07:11:49,230
that's super cool um my first thought
was I mean if they're firing now let's

21820
07:11:49,230 --> 07:11:49,240
was I mean if they're firing now let's
 

21821
07:11:49,240 --> 07:11:51,388
was I mean if they're firing now let's
see if I can affect them in some way so

21822
07:11:51,388 --> 07:11:51,398
see if I can affect them in some way so
 

21823
07:11:51,398 --> 07:11:53,030
see if I can affect them in some way so
I started trying to like wiggle my

21824
07:11:53,030 --> 07:11:53,040
I started trying to like wiggle my
 

21825
07:11:53,040 --> 07:11:55,910
I started trying to like wiggle my
fingers and I just started like scanning

21826
07:11:55,910 --> 07:11:55,920
fingers and I just started like scanning
 

21827
07:11:55,920 --> 07:11:57,868
fingers and I just started like scanning
through the channels and one of the

21828
07:11:57,868 --> 07:11:57,878
through the channels and one of the
 

21829
07:11:57,878 --> 07:11:59,388
through the channels and one of the
things I was doing was like moving my

21830
07:11:59,388 --> 07:11:59,398
things I was doing was like moving my
 

21831
07:11:59,398 --> 07:12:01,708
things I was doing was like moving my
index finger up and down and just saw

21832
07:12:01,708 --> 07:12:01,718
index finger up and down and just saw
 

21833
07:12:01,718 --> 07:12:04,708
index finger up and down and just saw
this yellow Spike on like top row like

21834
07:12:04,708 --> 07:12:04,718
this yellow Spike on like top row like
 

21835
07:12:04,718 --> 07:12:07,110
this yellow Spike on like top row like
third box over or something I saw this

21836
07:12:07,110 --> 07:12:07,120
third box over or something I saw this
 

21837
07:12:07,120 --> 07:12:08,830
third box over or something I saw this
yellow Spike every time I did it and I

21838
07:12:08,830 --> 07:12:08,840
yellow Spike every time I did it and I
 

21839
07:12:08,840 --> 07:12:10,510
yellow Spike every time I did it and I
was like oh that's cool and everyone

21840
07:12:10,510 --> 07:12:10,520
was like oh that's cool and everyone
 

21841
07:12:10,520 --> 07:12:11,788
was like oh that's cool and everyone
around me was just like what what are

21842
07:12:11,788 --> 07:12:11,798
around me was just like what what are
 

21843
07:12:11,798 --> 07:12:13,830
around me was just like what what are
you seeing I was like look look at this

21844
07:12:13,830 --> 07:12:13,840
you seeing I was like look look at this
 

21845
07:12:13,840 --> 07:12:16,868
you seeing I was like look look at this
one look at like this top Row third box

21846
07:12:16,868 --> 07:12:16,878
one look at like this top Row third box
 

21847
07:12:16,878 --> 07:12:19,510
one look at like this top Row third box
over this yellow Spike like that's me

21848
07:12:19,510 --> 07:12:19,520
over this yellow Spike like that's me
 

21849
07:12:19,520 --> 07:12:22,230
over this yellow Spike like that's me
right there there there and everyone was

21850
07:12:22,230 --> 07:12:22,240
right there there there and everyone was
 

21851
07:12:22,240 --> 07:12:24,468
right there there there and everyone was
freaking out they started like clapping

21852
07:12:24,468 --> 07:12:24,478
freaking out they started like clapping
 

21853
07:12:24,478 --> 07:12:25,868
freaking out they started like clapping
I was like that's super

21854
07:12:25,868 --> 07:12:25,878
I was like that's super
 

21855
07:12:25,878 --> 07:12:27,948
I was like that's super
unnecessary like this is what's supposed

21856
07:12:27,948 --> 07:12:27,958
unnecessary like this is what's supposed
 

21857
07:12:27,958 --> 07:12:31,350
unnecessary like this is what's supposed
to happen right like so you're imagining

21858
07:12:31,350 --> 07:12:31,360
to happen right like so you're imagining
 

21859
07:12:31,360 --> 07:12:33,030
to happen right like so you're imagining
your yourself moving each individual

21860
07:12:33,030 --> 07:12:33,040
your yourself moving each individual
 

21861
07:12:33,040 --> 07:12:35,310
your yourself moving each individual
finger one at a time and then seeing

21862
07:12:35,310 --> 07:12:35,320
finger one at a time and then seeing
 

21863
07:12:35,320 --> 07:12:36,990
finger one at a time and then seeing
like you can notice something and then

21864
07:12:36,990 --> 07:12:37,000
like you can notice something and then
 

21865
07:12:37,000 --> 07:12:38,310
like you can notice something and then
when you did the index finger you're

21866
07:12:38,310 --> 07:12:38,320
when you did the index finger you're
 

21867
07:12:38,320 --> 07:12:41,350
when you did the index finger you're
like oh yeah I was I was wiggling kind

21868
07:12:41,350 --> 07:12:41,360
like oh yeah I was I was wiggling kind
 

21869
07:12:41,360 --> 07:12:43,190
like oh yeah I was I was wiggling kind
of all of my fingers to see if anything

21870
07:12:43,190 --> 07:12:43,200
of all of my fingers to see if anything
 

21871
07:12:43,200 --> 07:12:46,150
of all of my fingers to see if anything
would happen there was a lot of other

21872
07:12:46,150 --> 07:12:46,160
would happen there was a lot of other
 

21873
07:12:46,160 --> 07:12:48,430
would happen there was a lot of other
things going on but that big yellow

21874
07:12:48,430 --> 07:12:48,440
things going on but that big yellow
 

21875
07:12:48,440 --> 07:12:50,548
things going on but that big yellow
Spike was the one that stood out to me

21876
07:12:50,548 --> 07:12:50,558
Spike was the one that stood out to me
 

21877
07:12:50,558 --> 07:12:52,590
Spike was the one that stood out to me
like I'm sure that if I would have

21878
07:12:52,590 --> 07:12:52,600
like I'm sure that if I would have
 

21879
07:12:52,600 --> 07:12:54,990
like I'm sure that if I would have
stared at it long enough I could have

21880
07:12:54,990 --> 07:12:55,000
stared at it long enough I could have
 

21881
07:12:55,000 --> 07:12:56,948
stared at it long enough I could have
mapped out maybe a hundred different

21882
07:12:56,948 --> 07:12:56,958
mapped out maybe a hundred different
 

21883
07:12:56,958 --> 07:12:59,190
mapped out maybe a hundred different
things but the big yellow Spike was the

21884
07:12:59,190 --> 07:12:59,200
things but the big yellow Spike was the
 

21885
07:12:59,200 --> 07:13:00,910
things but the big yellow Spike was the
one that I noticed maybe you could speak

21886
07:13:00,910 --> 07:13:00,920
one that I noticed maybe you could speak
 

21887
07:13:00,920 --> 07:13:03,070
one that I noticed maybe you could speak
to what it's like to sort of wiggle your

21888
07:13:03,070 --> 07:13:03,080
to what it's like to sort of wiggle your
 

21889
07:13:03,080 --> 07:13:06,750
to what it's like to sort of wiggle your
fingers to like to to imagine that the

21890
07:13:06,750 --> 07:13:06,760
fingers to like to to imagine that the
 

21891
07:13:06,760 --> 07:13:08,270
fingers to like to to imagine that the
that that the mental the cognitive

21892
07:13:08,270 --> 07:13:08,280
that that the mental the cognitive
 

21893
07:13:08,280 --> 07:13:10,510
that that the mental the cognitive
effort required to sort of wiggle your

21894
07:13:10,510 --> 07:13:10,520
effort required to sort of wiggle your
 

21895
07:13:10,520 --> 07:13:12,310
effort required to sort of wiggle your
index finger for example how easy is

21896
07:13:12,310 --> 07:13:12,320
index finger for example how easy is
 

21897
07:13:12,320 --> 07:13:14,868
index finger for example how easy is
that to do pretty easy for me uh it's

21898
07:13:14,868 --> 07:13:14,878
that to do pretty easy for me uh it's
 

21899
07:13:14,878 --> 07:13:16,150
that to do pretty easy for me uh it's
something

21900
07:13:16,150 --> 07:13:16,160
something
 

21901
07:13:16,160 --> 07:13:19,270
something
that at the very beginning after my

21902
07:13:19,270 --> 07:13:19,280
that at the very beginning after my
 

21903
07:13:19,280 --> 07:13:23,350
that at the very beginning after my
accident they told me to try and move my

21904
07:13:23,350 --> 07:13:23,360
accident they told me to try and move my
 

21905
07:13:23,360 --> 07:13:27,030
accident they told me to try and move my
body as much as possible even if you

21906
07:13:27,030 --> 07:13:27,040
body as much as possible even if you
 

21907
07:13:27,040 --> 07:13:29,468
body as much as possible even if you
know you can't just keep trying because

21908
07:13:29,468 --> 07:13:29,478
know you can't just keep trying because
 

21909
07:13:29,478 --> 07:13:31,628
know you can't just keep trying because
that's going to create new like neural

21910
07:13:31,628 --> 07:13:31,638
that's going to create new like neural
 

21911
07:13:31,638 --> 07:13:33,590
that's going to create new like neural
Pathways or Pathways in my spinal cord

21912
07:13:33,590 --> 07:13:33,600
Pathways or Pathways in my spinal cord
 

21913
07:13:33,600 --> 07:13:36,990
Pathways or Pathways in my spinal cord
to like reconnect these things um to

21914
07:13:36,990 --> 07:13:37,000
to like reconnect these things um to
 

21915
07:13:37,000 --> 07:13:39,190
to like reconnect these things um to
hopefully regain some movement someday

21916
07:13:39,190 --> 07:13:39,200
hopefully regain some movement someday
 

21917
07:13:39,200 --> 07:13:41,590
hopefully regain some movement someday
that's fascinating yeah I know it's it's

21918
07:13:41,590 --> 07:13:41,600
that's fascinating yeah I know it's it's
 

21919
07:13:41,600 --> 07:13:43,948
that's fascinating yeah I know it's it's
bizarre but I that's part of the

21920
07:13:43,948 --> 07:13:43,958
bizarre but I that's part of the
 

21921
07:13:43,958 --> 07:13:45,670
bizarre but I that's part of the
recovery process is to keep trying to

21922
07:13:45,670 --> 07:13:45,680
recovery process is to keep trying to
 

21923
07:13:45,680 --> 07:13:49,030
recovery process is to keep trying to
move your body yep and day as much as

21924
07:13:49,030 --> 07:13:49,040
move your body yep and day as much as
 

21925
07:13:49,040 --> 07:13:51,030
move your body yep and day as much as
you can and the nervous system does its

21926
07:13:51,030 --> 07:13:51,040
you can and the nervous system does its
 

21927
07:13:51,040 --> 07:13:52,670
you can and the nervous system does its
thing it's starts reconnecting it'll

21928
07:13:52,670 --> 07:13:52,680
thing it's starts reconnecting it'll
 

21929
07:13:52,680 --> 07:13:55,070
thing it's starts reconnecting it'll
start reconnecting um for some people

21930
07:13:55,070 --> 07:13:55,080
start reconnecting um for some people
 

21931
07:13:55,080 --> 07:13:57,310
start reconnecting um for some people
some people it never works some people

21932
07:13:57,310 --> 07:13:57,320
some people it never works some people
 

21933
07:13:57,320 --> 07:14:00,468
some people it never works some people
they'll do it like for me I got some

21934
07:14:00,468 --> 07:14:00,478
they'll do it like for me I got some
 

21935
07:14:00,478 --> 07:14:03,628
they'll do it like for me I got some
bicep control back um and that's about

21936
07:14:03,628 --> 07:14:03,638
bicep control back um and that's about
 

21937
07:14:03,638 --> 07:14:09,468
bicep control back um and that's about
it I can if I uh try enough I can wiggle

21938
07:14:09,468 --> 07:14:09,478
it I can if I uh try enough I can wiggle
 

21939
07:14:09,478 --> 07:14:12,830
it I can if I uh try enough I can wiggle
some of my fingers not like on command

21940
07:14:12,830 --> 07:14:12,840
some of my fingers not like on command
 

21941
07:14:12,840 --> 07:14:15,788
some of my fingers not like on command
it's more like if I try to move say my

21942
07:14:15,788 --> 07:14:15,798
it's more like if I try to move say my
 

21943
07:14:15,798 --> 07:14:17,628
it's more like if I try to move say my
right Pinky and I just keep trying to

21944
07:14:17,628 --> 07:14:17,638
right Pinky and I just keep trying to
 

21945
07:14:17,638 --> 07:14:20,230
right Pinky and I just keep trying to
move it after a few seconds it'll wiggle

21946
07:14:20,230 --> 07:14:20,240
move it after a few seconds it'll wiggle
 

21947
07:14:20,240 --> 07:14:22,270
move it after a few seconds it'll wiggle
um so I know there's stuff there like I

21948
07:14:22,270 --> 07:14:22,280
um so I know there's stuff there like I
 

21949
07:14:22,280 --> 07:14:24,070
um so I know there's stuff there like I
know like and that happens with you know

21950
07:14:24,070 --> 07:14:24,080
know like and that happens with you know
 

21951
07:14:24,080 --> 07:14:27,230
know like and that happens with you know
a few different of my fingers and stuff

21952
07:14:27,230 --> 07:14:27,240
a few different of my fingers and stuff
 

21953
07:14:27,240 --> 07:14:29,430
a few different of my fingers and stuff
um but yeah that's that's what they tell

21954
07:14:29,430 --> 07:14:29,440
um but yeah that's that's what they tell
 

21955
07:14:29,440 --> 07:14:32,670
um but yeah that's that's what they tell
you to do um one of the people at the

21956
07:14:32,670 --> 07:14:32,680
you to do um one of the people at the
 

21957
07:14:32,680 --> 07:14:34,310
you to do um one of the people at the
time when I was in the hospital came in

21958
07:14:34,310 --> 07:14:34,320
time when I was in the hospital came in
 

21959
07:14:34,320 --> 07:14:37,070
time when I was in the hospital came in
and told me for one guy who had

21960
07:14:37,070 --> 07:14:37,080
and told me for one guy who had
 

21961
07:14:37,080 --> 07:14:39,830
and told me for one guy who had
recovered um most of his control what he

21962
07:14:39,830 --> 07:14:39,840
recovered um most of his control what he
 

21963
07:14:39,840 --> 07:14:42,270
recovered um most of his control what he
thought about every day was actually

21964
07:14:42,270 --> 07:14:42,280
thought about every day was actually
 

21965
07:14:42,280 --> 07:14:45,510
thought about every day was actually
walking like the act of walking um just

21966
07:14:45,510 --> 07:14:45,520
walking like the act of walking um just
 

21967
07:14:45,520 --> 07:14:48,110
walking like the act of walking um just
over and over again so I try that for

21968
07:14:48,110 --> 07:14:48,120
over and over again so I try that for
 

21969
07:14:48,120 --> 07:14:51,990
over and over again so I try that for
years I try just imagining walking which

21970
07:14:51,990 --> 07:14:52,000
years I try just imagining walking which
 

21971
07:14:52,000 --> 07:14:56,830
years I try just imagining walking which
is it's hard it's hard to imagine like

21972
07:14:56,830 --> 07:14:56,840
is it's hard it's hard to imagine like
 

21973
07:14:56,840 --> 07:15:00,350
is it's hard it's hard to imagine like
all of the steps that go into well

21974
07:15:00,350 --> 07:15:00,360
all of the steps that go into well
 

21975
07:15:00,360 --> 07:15:01,948
all of the steps that go into well
taking a step like all of the things

21976
07:15:01,948 --> 07:15:01,958
taking a step like all of the things
 

21977
07:15:01,958 --> 07:15:04,590
taking a step like all of the things
that have to move like all of the

21978
07:15:04,590 --> 07:15:04,600
that have to move like all of the
 

21979
07:15:04,600 --> 07:15:06,830
that have to move like all of the
activations uh that have to happen along

21980
07:15:06,830 --> 07:15:06,840
activations uh that have to happen along
 

21981
07:15:06,840 --> 07:15:09,708
activations uh that have to happen along
your leg in order for one step to occur

21982
07:15:09,708 --> 07:15:09,718
your leg in order for one step to occur
 

21983
07:15:09,718 --> 07:15:11,468
your leg in order for one step to occur
but you're not just imagining you're

21984
07:15:11,468 --> 07:15:11,478
but you're not just imagining you're
 

21985
07:15:11,478 --> 07:15:14,070
but you're not just imagining you're
like doing it right I'm trying yeah so

21986
07:15:14,070 --> 07:15:14,080
like doing it right I'm trying yeah so
 

21987
07:15:14,080 --> 07:15:17,430
like doing it right I'm trying yeah so
it's like it's

21988
07:15:17,430 --> 07:15:17,440
it's like it's
 

21989
07:15:17,440 --> 07:15:20,990
it's like it's
imagining over again what I had to do to

21990
07:15:20,990 --> 07:15:21,000
imagining over again what I had to do to
 

21991
07:15:21,000 --> 07:15:22,830
imagining over again what I had to do to
take a step because it's not something

21992
07:15:22,830 --> 07:15:22,840
take a step because it's not something
 

21993
07:15:22,840 --> 07:15:24,590
take a step because it's not something
any of us think about we just you want

21994
07:15:24,590 --> 07:15:24,600
any of us think about we just you want
 

21995
07:15:24,600 --> 07:15:26,990
any of us think about we just you want
to walk and you take a step um you don't

21996
07:15:26,990 --> 07:15:27,000
to walk and you take a step um you don't
 

21997
07:15:27,000 --> 07:15:28,708
to walk and you take a step um you don't
think about all of the different things

21998
07:15:28,708 --> 07:15:28,718
think about all of the different things
 

21999
07:15:28,718 --> 07:15:31,628
think about all of the different things
that are going on in your body so I had

22000
07:15:31,628 --> 07:15:31,638
that are going on in your body so I had
 

22001
07:15:31,638 --> 07:15:34,388
that are going on in your body so I had
to recreate that in my head as much as I

22002
07:15:34,388 --> 07:15:34,398
to recreate that in my head as much as I
 

22003
07:15:34,398 --> 07:15:36,830
to recreate that in my head as much as I
could and then I practice it over and

22004
07:15:36,830 --> 07:15:36,840
could and then I practice it over and
 

22005
07:15:36,840 --> 07:15:38,628
could and then I practice it over and
over and over so it's not like a third

22006
07:15:38,628 --> 07:15:38,638
over and over so it's not like a third
 

22007
07:15:38,638 --> 07:15:40,510
over and over so it's not like a third
person perspective as a first person

22008
07:15:40,510 --> 07:15:40,520
person perspective as a first person
 

22009
07:15:40,520 --> 07:15:42,310
person perspective as a first person
perspective you're like it's not like

22010
07:15:42,310 --> 07:15:42,320
perspective you're like it's not like
 

22011
07:15:42,320 --> 07:15:44,468
perspective you're like it's not like
you're imagining yourself walking you're

22012
07:15:44,468 --> 07:15:44,478
you're imagining yourself walking you're
 

22013
07:15:44,478 --> 07:15:47,910
you're imagining yourself walking you're
like literally doing this everything all

22014
07:15:47,910 --> 07:15:47,920
like literally doing this everything all
 

22015
07:15:47,920 --> 07:15:49,910
like literally doing this everything all
the same stuff as if you're walking yeah

22016
07:15:49,910 --> 07:15:49,920
the same stuff as if you're walking yeah
 

22017
07:15:49,920 --> 07:15:52,628
the same stuff as if you're walking yeah
which which was hard it was hard at the

22018
07:15:52,628 --> 07:15:52,638
which which was hard it was hard at the
 

22019
07:15:52,638 --> 07:15:55,310
which which was hard it was hard at the
beginning like frustrating hard or like

22020
07:15:55,310 --> 07:15:55,320
beginning like frustrating hard or like
 

22021

beginning like frustrating hard or like
actually cognitively hard like which way

07:15:57,310 --> 07:15:57,320
actually cognitively hard like which way
 

22023
07:15:57,320 --> 07:16:02,350
actually cognitively hard like which way
uh it was both um

22024
07:16:02,350 --> 07:16:02,360

 

22025
07:16:02,360 --> 07:16:04,788

07:16:31,680 --> 07:16:35,468
she could move again
I did that for years just stared at my

22050
07:16:35,468 --> 07:16:35,478
I did that for years just stared at my
 

22051
07:16:35,478 --> 07:16:38,388
I did that for years just stared at my
body and said move your index finger

22052
07:16:38,388 --> 07:16:38,398
body and said move your index finger
 

22053
07:16:38,398 --> 07:16:41,230
body and said move your index finger
move your big toe um sometimes

22054
07:16:41,230 --> 07:16:41,240
move your big toe um sometimes
 

22055
07:16:41,240 --> 07:16:43,430
move your big toe um sometimes
vocalizing it like out loud sometimes

22056
07:16:43,430 --> 07:16:43,440
vocalizing it like out loud sometimes
 

22057
07:16:43,440 --> 07:16:45,948
vocalizing it like out loud sometimes
just thinking it I tried every different

22058
07:16:45,948 --> 07:16:45,958
just thinking it I tried every different
 

22059
07:16:45,958 --> 07:16:47,948
just thinking it I tried every different
way to do this to try to get some

22060
07:16:47,948 --> 07:16:47,958
way to do this to try to get some
 

22061
07:16:47,958 --> 07:16:51,030
way to do this to try to get some
movement back and it's hard because it

22062
07:16:51,030 --> 07:16:51,040
movement back and it's hard because it
 

22063
07:16:51,040 --> 07:16:54,548
movement back and it's hard because it
it actually is like taxing like

22064
07:16:54,548 --> 07:16:54,558
it actually is like taxing like
 

22065
07:16:54,558 --> 07:16:56,910
it actually is like taxing like
physically taxing on my body which is

22066
07:16:56,910 --> 07:16:56,920
physically taxing on my body which is
 

22067
07:16:56,920 --> 07:16:58,510
physically taxing on my body which is
something I would have never expected

22068
07:16:58,510 --> 07:16:58,520
something I would have never expected
 

22069
07:16:58,520 --> 07:17:00,350
something I would have never expected
because it's not like I'm moving but it

22070
07:17:00,350 --> 07:17:00,360
because it's not like I'm moving but it
 

22071
07:17:00,360 --> 07:17:04,868
because it's not like I'm moving but it
feels like there's a buildup of I don't

22072
07:17:04,868 --> 07:17:04,878
feels like there's a buildup of I don't
 

22073
07:17:04,878 --> 07:17:08,030
feels like there's a buildup of I don't
know the the only way I can describe it

22074
07:17:08,030 --> 07:17:08,040
know the the only way I can describe it
 

22075
07:17:08,040 --> 07:17:11,590
know the the only way I can describe it
is there are like signals that aren't

22076
07:17:11,590 --> 07:17:11,600
is there are like signals that aren't
 

22077
07:17:11,600 --> 07:17:14,708
is there are like signals that aren't
getting through from my brain um down

22078
07:17:14,708 --> 07:17:14,718
getting through from my brain um down
 

22079
07:17:14,718 --> 07:17:16,430
getting through from my brain um down
because of my there's that Gap in my

22080
07:17:16,430 --> 07:17:16,440
because of my there's that Gap in my
 

22081
07:17:16,440 --> 07:17:18,990
because of my there's that Gap in my
spinal cord so brain down and then from

22082
07:17:18,990 --> 07:17:19,000
spinal cord so brain down and then from
 

22083
07:17:19,000 --> 07:17:22,190
spinal cord so brain down and then from
my hand back up to the brain and so it

22084
07:17:22,190 --> 07:17:22,200
my hand back up to the brain and so it
 

22085
07:17:22,200 --> 07:17:26,230
my hand back up to the brain and so it
feels like those signals um get stuck in

22086
07:17:26,230 --> 07:17:26,240
feels like those signals um get stuck in
 

22087
07:17:26,240 --> 07:17:27,830
feels like those signals um get stuck in
whatever body part that I'm trying to

22088
07:17:27,830 --> 07:17:27,840
whatever body part that I'm trying to
 

22089
07:17:27,840 --> 07:17:30,190
whatever body part that I'm trying to
move and they just build up and build up

22090
07:17:30,190 --> 07:17:30,200
move and they just build up and build up
 

22091
07:17:30,200 --> 07:17:32,670
move and they just build up and build up
and build up until they burst um and

22092
07:17:32,670 --> 07:17:32,680
and build up until they burst um and
 

22093
07:17:32,680 --> 07:17:34,830
and build up until they burst um and
then once they burst I get like this

22094
07:17:34,830 --> 07:17:34,840
then once they burst I get like this
 

22095
07:17:34,840 --> 07:17:37,110
then once they burst I get like this
really weird sensation of everything

22096
07:17:37,110 --> 07:17:37,120
really weird sensation of everything
 

22097
07:17:37,120 --> 07:17:39,230
really weird sensation of everything
sort of like dissipating back out to

22098
07:17:39,230 --> 07:17:39,240
sort of like dissipating back out to
 

22099
07:17:39,240 --> 07:17:42,788
sort of like dissipating back out to
level and then I do it again um it's

22100
07:17:42,788 --> 07:17:42,798
level and then I do it again um it's
 

22101
07:17:42,798 --> 07:17:45,510
level and then I do it again um it's
also just like a fatigue thing like a

22102
07:17:45,510 --> 07:17:45,520
also just like a fatigue thing like a
 

22103
07:17:45,520 --> 07:17:47,590
also just like a fatigue thing like a
muscle fatigue but without actually

22104
07:17:47,590 --> 07:17:47,600
muscle fatigue but without actually
 

22105
07:17:47,600 --> 07:17:50,430
muscle fatigue but without actually
moving your muscles it's very very

22106
07:17:50,430 --> 07:17:50,440
moving your muscles it's very very
 

22107
07:17:50,440 --> 07:17:53,150
moving your muscles it's very very
bizarre and then you know uh if you try

22108
07:17:53,150 --> 07:17:53,160
bizarre and then you know uh if you try
 

22109
07:17:53,160 --> 07:17:56,190
bizarre and then you know uh if you try
to stare at a body part or think about a

22110
07:17:56,190 --> 07:17:56,200
to stare at a body part or think about a
 

22111
07:17:56,200 --> 07:18:00,270
to stare at a body part or think about a
body part and move for two three four

22112
07:18:00,270 --> 07:18:00,280
body part and move for two three four
 

22113
07:18:00,280 --> 07:18:02,910
body part and move for two three four
sometimes eight hours it's very taxing

22114
07:18:02,910 --> 07:18:02,920
sometimes eight hours it's very taxing
 

22115
07:18:02,920 --> 07:18:06,590
sometimes eight hours it's very taxing
on your mind it's takes a lot of focus

22116
07:18:06,590 --> 07:18:06,600
on your mind it's takes a lot of focus
 

22117
07:18:06,600 --> 07:18:09,270
on your mind it's takes a lot of focus
um it was a lot easier at the beginning

22118
07:18:09,270 --> 07:18:09,280
um it was a lot easier at the beginning
 

22119
07:18:09,280 --> 07:18:13,388
um it was a lot easier at the beginning
because I wasn't able to like control a

22120
07:18:13,388 --> 07:18:13,398
because I wasn't able to like control a
 

22121
07:18:13,398 --> 07:18:15,310
because I wasn't able to like control a
TV in my room or anything I wasn't able

22122
07:18:15,310 --> 07:18:15,320
TV in my room or anything I wasn't able
 

22123
07:18:15,320 --> 07:18:18,990
TV in my room or anything I wasn't able
to um control any of my environment so

22124
07:18:18,990 --> 07:18:19,000
to um control any of my environment so
 

22125
07:18:19,000 --> 07:18:21,150
to um control any of my environment so
for the first few years a lot of what I

22126
07:18:21,150 --> 07:18:21,160
for the first few years a lot of what I
 

22127
07:18:21,160 --> 07:18:25,788
for the first few years a lot of what I
was doing was staring at walls and so um

22128
07:18:25,788 --> 07:18:25,798
was doing was staring at walls and so um
 

22129
07:18:25,798 --> 07:18:28,590
was doing was staring at walls and so um
obviously I did a lot of thinking and I

22130
07:18:28,590 --> 07:18:28,600
obviously I did a lot of thinking and I
 

22131
07:18:28,600 --> 07:18:31,510
obviously I did a lot of thinking and I
tried to move a lot just over and over

22132
07:18:31,510 --> 07:18:31,520
tried to move a lot just over and over
 

22133
07:18:31,520 --> 07:18:33,910
tried to move a lot just over and over
and over again so you never gave up Sort

22134
07:18:33,910 --> 07:18:33,920
and over again so you never gave up Sort
 

22135
07:18:33,920 --> 07:18:37,070
and over again so you never gave up Sort
of hope there just training hard

22136
07:18:37,070 --> 07:18:37,080
of hope there just training hard
 

22137
07:18:37,080 --> 07:18:39,548
of hope there just training hard
essentially yep and I still do it I do

22138
07:18:39,548 --> 07:18:39,558
essentially yep and I still do it I do
 

22139
07:18:39,558 --> 07:18:43,310
essentially yep and I still do it I do
it like subconsciously and I think that

22140
07:18:43,310 --> 07:18:43,320
it like subconsciously and I think that
 

22141
07:18:43,320 --> 07:18:46,310
it like subconsciously and I think that
uh that helped a lot with things with

22142
07:18:46,310 --> 07:18:46,320
uh that helped a lot with things with
 

22143
07:18:46,320 --> 07:18:48,788
uh that helped a lot with things with
neuralink honestly it's something that I

22144
07:18:48,788 --> 07:18:48,798
neuralink honestly it's something that I
 

22145
07:18:48,798 --> 07:18:50,990
neuralink honestly it's something that I
talked about the other day at the All

22146
07:18:50,990 --> 07:18:51,000
talked about the other day at the All
 

22147
07:18:51,000 --> 07:18:53,070
talked about the other day at the All
Hands that I did at nerling Austin

22148
07:18:53,070 --> 07:18:53,080
Hands that I did at nerling Austin
 

22149
07:18:53,080 --> 07:18:54,788
Hands that I did at nerling Austin
facility Welcome to Austin by the way

22150
07:18:54,788 --> 07:18:54,798
facility Welcome to Austin by the way
 

22151
07:18:54,798 --> 07:18:57,070
facility Welcome to Austin by the way
yeah hey thanks man I I went to school

22152
07:18:57,070 --> 07:18:57,080
yeah hey thanks man I I went to school
 

22153
07:18:57,080 --> 07:18:58,830
yeah hey thanks man I I went to school
hey thanks thanks man the the

22154

hey thanks thanks man the the
gigafactory was super cool I went toool

22156
07:19:00,670 --> 07:19:00,680
gigafactory was super cool I went toool
 

22157
07:19:00,680 --> 07:19:02,270
gigafactory was super cool I went toool
cool at Texas A&M so I've been around

22158
07:19:02,270 --> 07:19:02,280
cool at Texas A&M so I've been around
 

22159
07:19:02,280 --> 07:19:04,430
cool at Texas A&M so I've been around
for um so you should be saying welcome

22160
07:19:04,430 --> 07:19:04,440
for um so you should be saying welcome
 

22161
07:19:04,440 --> 07:19:08,150
for um so you should be saying welcome
to me welcome to Texas Le yeah I get you

22162
07:19:08,150 --> 07:19:08,160
to me welcome to Texas Le yeah I get you
 

22163
07:19:08,160 --> 07:19:11,150
to me welcome to Texas Le yeah I get you
um but yeah I was talking about how a

22164
07:19:11,150 --> 07:19:11,160
um but yeah I was talking about how a
 

22165
07:19:11,160 --> 07:19:13,150
um but yeah I was talking about how a
lot of what they've had me do especially

22166
07:19:13,150 --> 07:19:13,160
lot of what they've had me do especially
 

22167
07:19:13,160 --> 07:19:15,150
lot of what they've had me do especially
at the beginning um well I still do it

22168
07:19:15,150 --> 07:19:15,160
at the beginning um well I still do it
 

22169
07:19:15,160 --> 07:19:18,708
at the beginning um well I still do it
now um is body mapping so like there

22170
07:19:18,708 --> 07:19:18,718
now um is body mapping so like there
 

22171
07:19:18,718 --> 07:19:22,150
now um is body mapping so like there
will be a visualization of a hand or an

22172
07:19:22,150 --> 07:19:22,160
will be a visualization of a hand or an
 

22173
07:19:22,160 --> 07:19:24,868
will be a visualization of a hand or an
arm on the screen and I have to do that

22174
07:19:24,868 --> 07:19:24,878
arm on the screen and I have to do that
 

22175
07:19:24,878 --> 07:19:27,990
arm on the screen and I have to do that
motion and that's how they sort of train

22176
07:19:27,990 --> 07:19:28,000
motion and that's how they sort of train
 

22177
07:19:28,000 --> 07:19:30,750
motion and that's how they sort of train
um the algorithm to like understand what

22178
07:19:30,750 --> 07:19:30,760
um the algorithm to like understand what
 

22179
07:19:30,760 --> 07:19:33,110
um the algorithm to like understand what
I'm trying to do and so it it made

22180
07:19:33,110 --> 07:19:33,120
I'm trying to do and so it it made
 

22181
07:19:33,120 --> 07:19:37,788
I'm trying to do and so it it made
things very uh seamless um for me I

22182
07:19:37,788 --> 07:19:37,798
things very uh seamless um for me I
 

22183
07:19:37,798 --> 07:19:39,990
things very uh seamless um for me I
think that's really really cool so it's

22184
07:19:39,990 --> 07:19:40,000
think that's really really cool so it's
 

22185
07:19:40,000 --> 07:19:41,468
think that's really really cool so it's
it's it's amazing to know cuz I I've

22186
07:19:41,468 --> 07:19:41,478
it's it's amazing to know cuz I I've
 

22187
07:19:41,478 --> 07:19:43,310
it's it's amazing to know cuz I I've
learned a lot about the body mapping

22188
07:19:43,310 --> 07:19:43,320
learned a lot about the body mapping
 

22189
07:19:43,320 --> 07:19:45,590
learned a lot about the body mapping
procedure yeah like with the with the

22190
07:19:45,590 --> 07:19:45,600
procedure yeah like with the with the
 

22191
07:19:45,600 --> 07:19:46,868
procedure yeah like with the with the
interface and everything like that it's

22192
07:19:46,868 --> 07:19:46,878
interface and everything like that it's
 

22193
07:19:46,878 --> 07:19:48,270
interface and everything like that it's
cool to know that you've been

22194
07:19:48,270 --> 07:19:48,280
cool to know that you've been
 

22195
07:19:48,280 --> 07:19:51,350
cool to know that you've been
essentially like training to be like

22196
07:19:51,350 --> 07:19:51,360
essentially like training to be like
 

22197
07:19:51,360 --> 07:19:55,990
essentially like training to be like
world class at that task yeah yeah I I I

22198
07:19:55,990 --> 07:19:56,000
world class at that task yeah yeah I I I
 

22199
07:19:56,000 --> 07:19:58,830
world class at that task yeah yeah I I I
don't know if other quadriplegics like

22200
07:19:58,830 --> 07:19:58,840
don't know if other quadriplegics like
 

22201
07:19:58,840 --> 07:20:01,910
don't know if other quadriplegics like
other paralyzed people give up I hope

22202
07:20:01,910 --> 07:20:01,920
other paralyzed people give up I hope
 

22203
07:20:01,920 --> 07:20:05,070
other paralyzed people give up I hope
they don't um I hope they keep trying

22204
07:20:05,070 --> 07:20:05,080
they don't um I hope they keep trying
 

22205
07:20:05,080 --> 07:20:08,070
they don't um I hope they keep trying
because I've heard other paralyzed

22206
07:20:08,070 --> 07:20:08,080
because I've heard other paralyzed
 

22207
07:20:08,080 --> 07:20:10,310
because I've heard other paralyzed
people say like don't ever stop they

22208
07:20:10,310 --> 07:20:10,320
people say like don't ever stop they
 

22209
07:20:10,320 --> 07:20:13,548
people say like don't ever stop they
tell you two years but um you you just

22210
07:20:13,548 --> 07:20:13,558
tell you two years but um you you just
 

22211
07:20:13,558 --> 07:20:16,350
tell you two years but um you you just
never know you the human body's capable

22212
07:20:16,350 --> 07:20:16,360
never know you the human body's capable
 

22213
07:20:16,360 --> 07:20:20,190
never know you the human body's capable
of amazing things so um I've heard other

22214
07:20:20,190 --> 07:20:20,200
of amazing things so um I've heard other
 

22215
07:20:20,200 --> 07:20:22,230
of amazing things so um I've heard other
people say don't give up uh like I think

22216
07:20:22,230 --> 07:20:22,240
people say don't give up uh like I think
 

22217
07:20:22,240 --> 07:20:25,788
people say don't give up uh like I think
one girl had um spoken to me through

22218
07:20:25,788 --> 07:20:25,798
one girl had um spoken to me through
 

22219
07:20:25,798 --> 07:20:27,708
one girl had um spoken to me through
some family members and said that she

22220
07:20:27,708 --> 07:20:27,718
some family members and said that she
 

22221
07:20:27,718 --> 07:20:30,750
some family members and said that she
had been paralyzed you know for 18 years

22222
07:20:30,750 --> 07:20:30,760
had been paralyzed you know for 18 years
 

22223
07:20:30,760 --> 07:20:33,230
had been paralyzed you know for 18 years
and she'd been trying to like wiggle her

22224
07:20:33,230 --> 07:20:33,240
and she'd been trying to like wiggle her
 

22225
07:20:33,240 --> 07:20:35,270
and she'd been trying to like wiggle her
index finger for all that time and she

22226
07:20:35,270 --> 07:20:35,280
index finger for all that time and she
 

22227
07:20:35,280 --> 07:20:37,868
index finger for all that time and she
finally got it back like 18 years later

22228
07:20:37,868 --> 07:20:37,878
finally got it back like 18 years later
 

22229
07:20:37,878 --> 07:20:39,868
finally got it back like 18 years later
so like I know that it's possible and

22230
07:20:39,868 --> 07:20:39,878
so like I know that it's possible and
 

22231
07:20:39,878 --> 07:20:42,350
so like I know that it's possible and
I'll never give up doing it I just I do

22232
07:20:42,350 --> 07:20:42,360
I'll never give up doing it I just I do
 

22233
07:20:42,360 --> 07:20:44,468
I'll never give up doing it I just I do
it when I'm lying down like watching TV

22234
07:20:44,468 --> 07:20:44,478
it when I'm lying down like watching TV
 

22235
07:20:44,478 --> 07:20:47,670
it when I'm lying down like watching TV
I'll find myself doing it kind of just

22236
07:20:47,670 --> 07:20:47,680
I'll find myself doing it kind of just
 

22237
07:20:47,680 --> 07:20:48,948
I'll find myself doing it kind of just
almost like on its own it's just

22238
07:20:48,948 --> 07:20:48,958
almost like on its own it's just
 

22239
07:20:48,958 --> 07:20:51,110
almost like on its own it's just
something I've gotten so used to doing

22240
07:20:51,110 --> 07:20:51,120
something I've gotten so used to doing
 

22241
07:20:51,120 --> 07:20:53,350
something I've gotten so used to doing
that I don't know I I don't think I'll

22242
07:20:53,350 --> 07:20:53,360
that I don't know I I don't think I'll
 

22243
07:20:53,360 --> 07:20:54,910
that I don't know I I don't think I'll
ever stop that's really awesome to hear

22244
07:20:54,910 --> 07:20:54,920
ever stop that's really awesome to hear
 

22245
07:20:54,920 --> 07:20:56,150
ever stop that's really awesome to hear
cuz I think it's one of those things

22246
07:20:56,150 --> 07:20:56,160
cuz I think it's one of those things
 

22247
07:20:56,160 --> 07:20:58,270
cuz I think it's one of those things
that can really pay off in in the long

22248
07:20:58,270 --> 07:20:58,280
that can really pay off in in the long
 

22249
07:20:58,280 --> 07:21:00,270
that can really pay off in in the long
term cuz like it is training you're not

22250
07:21:00,270 --> 07:21:00,280
term cuz like it is training you're not
 

22251
07:21:00,280 --> 07:21:02,190
term cuz like it is training you're not
VIs seen the results of that training at

22252
07:21:02,190 --> 07:21:02,200
VIs seen the results of that training at
 

22253
07:21:02,200 --> 07:21:04,750
VIs seen the results of that training at
the moment but like there's that like

22254
07:21:04,750 --> 07:21:04,760
the moment but like there's that like
 

22255
07:21:04,760 --> 07:21:06,990
the moment but like there's that like
Olympic level nervous system getting

22256
07:21:06,990 --> 07:21:07,000
Olympic level nervous system getting
 

22257
07:21:07,000 --> 07:21:09,150
Olympic level nervous system getting
getting ready for something honestly was

22258
07:21:09,150 --> 07:21:09,160
getting ready for something honestly was
 

22259
07:21:09,160 --> 07:21:12,590
getting ready for something honestly was
like something that I think nurlink gave

22260
07:21:12,590 --> 07:21:12,600
like something that I think nurlink gave
 

22261
07:21:12,600 --> 07:21:17,270
like something that I think nurlink gave
me that um I can't I can't think them

22262
07:21:17,270 --> 07:21:17,280
me that um I can't I can't think them
 

22263
07:21:17,280 --> 07:21:19,150
me that um I can't I can't think them
enough for like I can't show my

22264
07:21:19,150 --> 07:21:19,160
enough for like I can't show my
 

22265
07:21:19,160 --> 07:21:22,230
enough for like I can't show my
appreciation for it enough was being

22266
07:21:22,230 --> 07:21:22,240
appreciation for it enough was being
 

22267
07:21:22,240 --> 07:21:27,788
appreciation for it enough was being
able to visually see that what I'm doing

22268
07:21:27,788 --> 07:21:27,798
able to visually see that what I'm doing
 

22269
07:21:27,798 --> 07:21:31,310
able to visually see that what I'm doing
is actually having some effect yeah um

22270
07:21:31,310 --> 07:21:31,320
is actually having some effect yeah um
 

22271
07:21:31,320 --> 07:21:35,110
is actually having some effect yeah um
it's a huge part of the reason why like

22272
07:21:35,110 --> 07:21:35,120
it's a huge part of the reason why like
 

22273
07:21:35,120 --> 07:21:37,468
it's a huge part of the reason why like
I know now that I'm going to keep doing

22274
07:21:37,468 --> 07:21:37,478
I know now that I'm going to keep doing
 

22275
07:21:37,478 --> 07:21:40,150
I know now that I'm going to keep doing
it forever because before nuring I was

22276
07:21:40,150 --> 07:21:40,160
it forever because before nuring I was
 

22277
07:21:40,160 --> 07:21:44,230
it forever because before nuring I was
doing it every day and I was just

22278
07:21:44,230 --> 07:21:44,240
doing it every day and I was just
 

22279
07:21:44,240 --> 07:21:46,670
doing it every day and I was just
assuming that things were happening like

22280
07:21:46,670 --> 07:21:46,680
assuming that things were happening like
 

22281
07:21:46,680 --> 07:21:48,310
assuming that things were happening like
it's not like I knew I wasn't getting

22282
07:21:48,310 --> 07:21:48,320
it's not like I knew I wasn't getting
 

22283
07:21:48,320 --> 07:21:52,190
it's not like I knew I wasn't getting
back any Mobility or um sensation or

22284
07:21:52,190 --> 07:21:52,200
back any Mobility or um sensation or
 

22285
07:21:52,200 --> 07:21:54,548
back any Mobility or um sensation or
anything so I could have been running up

22286
07:21:54,548 --> 07:21:54,558
anything so I could have been running up
 

22287
07:21:54,558 --> 07:21:57,708
anything so I could have been running up
against a brick wall for all I knew and

22288
07:21:57,708 --> 07:21:57,718
against a brick wall for all I knew and
 

22289
07:21:57,718 --> 07:22:00,548
against a brick wall for all I knew and
with nurlink I get to see like all the

22290
07:22:00,548 --> 07:22:00,558
with nurlink I get to see like all the
 

22291
07:22:00,558 --> 07:22:04,590
with nurlink I get to see like all the
signals happening real time and I get to

22292
07:22:04,590 --> 07:22:04,600
signals happening real time and I get to
 

22293
07:22:04,600 --> 07:22:07,310
signals happening real time and I get to
see that you know what I'm doing can

22294
07:22:07,310 --> 07:22:07,320
see that you know what I'm doing can
 

22295
07:22:07,320 --> 07:22:09,430
see that you know what I'm doing can
actually be mapped you know when we

22296
07:22:09,430 --> 07:22:09,440
actually be mapped you know when we
 

22297
07:22:09,440 --> 07:22:11,030
actually be mapped you know when we
started doing like click calibrations

22298
07:22:11,030 --> 07:22:11,040
started doing like click calibrations
 

22299
07:22:11,040 --> 07:22:12,948
started doing like click calibrations
and stuff when I go to click my index

22300
07:22:12,948 --> 07:22:12,958
and stuff when I go to click my index
 

22301
07:22:12,958 --> 07:22:15,590
and stuff when I go to click my index
finger for a left click that it actually

22302
07:22:15,590 --> 07:22:15,600
finger for a left click that it actually
 

22303
07:22:15,600 --> 07:22:18,788
finger for a left click that it actually
recognizes that like it it changed how I

22304
07:22:18,788 --> 07:22:18,798
recognizes that like it it changed how I
 

22305
07:22:18,798 --> 07:22:22,708
recognizes that like it it changed how I
think about what's possible with like

22306
07:22:22,708 --> 07:22:22,718
think about what's possible with like
 

22307
07:22:22,718 --> 07:22:26,670
think about what's possible with like
retraining my body to move and so yeah

22308
07:22:26,670 --> 07:22:26,680
retraining my body to move and so yeah
 

22309
07:22:26,680 --> 07:22:28,350
retraining my body to move and so yeah
I'll I'll never give up now and also

22310
07:22:28,350 --> 07:22:28,360
I'll I'll never give up now and also
 

22311
07:22:28,360 --> 07:22:29,788
I'll I'll never give up now and also
just the signal that there's still a

22312
07:22:29,788 --> 07:22:29,798
just the signal that there's still a
 

22313
07:22:29,798 --> 07:22:32,510
just the signal that there's still a
Powerhouse of brain there that's like

22314
07:22:32,510 --> 07:22:32,520
Powerhouse of brain there that's like
 

22315
07:22:32,520 --> 07:22:34,910
Powerhouse of brain there that's like
that's and as the technology develops

22316
07:22:34,910 --> 07:22:34,920
that's and as the technology develops
 

22317
07:22:34,920 --> 07:22:36,750
that's and as the technology develops
that brain is I mean that's the most

22318
07:22:36,750 --> 07:22:36,760
that brain is I mean that's the most
 

22319
07:22:36,760 --> 07:22:38,230
that brain is I mean that's the most
important thing about the human body is

22320
07:22:38,230 --> 07:22:38,240
important thing about the human body is
 

22321
07:22:38,240 --> 07:22:39,868
important thing about the human body is
the brain and it can do a lot of the

22322
07:22:39,868 --> 07:22:39,878
the brain and it can do a lot of the
 

22323
07:22:39,878 --> 07:22:41,910
the brain and it can do a lot of the
control so what did it feel like when

22324
07:22:41,910 --> 07:22:41,920
control so what did it feel like when
 

22325
07:22:41,920 --> 07:22:44,070
control so what did it feel like when
you first could wiggle the index finger

22326
07:22:44,070 --> 07:22:44,080
you first could wiggle the index finger
 

22327
07:22:44,080 --> 07:22:47,030
you first could wiggle the index finger
and and saw the environment respond like

22328
07:22:47,030 --> 07:22:47,040
and and saw the environment respond like
 

22329
07:22:47,040 --> 07:22:49,670
and and saw the environment respond like
that little yeah where everybody was

22330
07:22:49,670 --> 07:22:49,680
that little yeah where everybody was
 

22331
07:22:49,680 --> 07:22:51,388
that little yeah where everybody was
being way too dramatic according to you

22332
07:22:51,388 --> 07:22:51,398
being way too dramatic according to you
 

22333
07:22:51,398 --> 07:22:53,910
being way too dramatic according to you
yeah it was very cool I mean it was cool

22334
07:22:53,910 --> 07:22:53,920
yeah it was very cool I mean it was cool
 

22335
07:22:53,920 --> 07:22:56,670
yeah it was very cool I mean it was cool
but it I keep telling this to people it

22336
07:22:56,670 --> 07:22:56,680
but it I keep telling this to people it
 

22337
07:22:56,680 --> 07:22:59,948
but it I keep telling this to people it
made sense to me like it made sense that

22338
07:22:59,948 --> 07:22:59,958
made sense to me like it made sense that
 

22339
07:22:59,958 --> 07:23:02,308
made sense to me like it made sense that
you know there are signals still

22340
07:23:02,308 --> 07:23:02,318
you know there are signals still
 

22341
07:23:02,318 --> 07:23:05,110
you know there are signals still
happening in my brain and that as long

22342
07:23:05,110 --> 07:23:05,120
happening in my brain and that as long
 

22343
07:23:05,120 --> 07:23:07,948
happening in my brain and that as long
as you had something near it that could

22344
07:23:07,948 --> 07:23:07,958
as you had something near it that could
 

22345
07:23:07,958 --> 07:23:09,708
as you had something near it that could
measure those that could record those

22346
07:23:09,708 --> 07:23:09,718
measure those that could record those
 

22347
07:23:09,718 --> 07:23:11,948
measure those that could record those
then you should be able to like

22348
07:23:11,948 --> 07:23:11,958
then you should be able to like
 

22349
07:23:11,958 --> 07:23:13,590
then you should be able to like
visualize it in some way like see it

22350
07:23:13,590 --> 07:23:13,600
visualize it in some way like see it
 

22351
07:23:13,600 --> 07:23:16,468
visualize it in some way like see it
happen and so that was not very

22352
07:23:16,468 --> 07:23:16,478
happen and so that was not very
 

22353
07:23:16,478 --> 07:23:18,548
happen and so that was not very
surprising to me I was just like oh cool

22354
07:23:18,548 --> 07:23:18,558
surprising to me I was just like oh cool
 

22355
07:23:18,558 --> 07:23:20,868
surprising to me I was just like oh cool
like we we found one like we found

22356
07:23:20,868 --> 07:23:20,878
like we we found one like we found
 

22357
07:23:20,878 --> 07:23:23,628
like we we found one like we found
something that works um it was cool to

22358
07:23:23,628 --> 07:23:23,638
something that works um it was cool to
 

22359
07:23:23,638 --> 07:23:26,510
something that works um it was cool to
see that their technology worked um and

22360
07:23:26,510 --> 07:23:26,520
see that their technology worked um and
 

22361
07:23:26,520 --> 07:23:27,910
see that their technology worked um and
that everything that they had worked so

22362
07:23:27,910 --> 07:23:27,920
that everything that they had worked so
 

22363
07:23:27,920 --> 07:23:30,750
that everything that they had worked so
hard for was like going to pay off um um

22364
07:23:30,750 --> 07:23:30,760
hard for was like going to pay off um um
 

22365
07:23:30,760 --> 07:23:32,350
hard for was like going to pay off um um
but I hadn't like moved a cursor or

22366
07:23:32,350 --> 07:23:32,360
but I hadn't like moved a cursor or
 

22367
07:23:32,360 --> 07:23:33,868
but I hadn't like moved a cursor or
anything at that point I hadn't like

22368
07:23:33,868 --> 07:23:33,878
anything at that point I hadn't like
 

22369
07:23:33,878 --> 07:23:35,350
anything at that point I hadn't like
interacted with a computer or anything

22370
07:23:35,350 --> 07:23:35,360
interacted with a computer or anything
 

22371
07:23:35,360 --> 07:23:40,030
interacted with a computer or anything
at that point um so it it it just made

22372
07:23:40,030 --> 07:23:40,040
at that point um so it it it just made
 

22373
07:23:40,040 --> 07:23:42,830
at that point um so it it it just made
sense it was cool like like I I I didn't

22374
07:23:42,830 --> 07:23:42,840
sense it was cool like like I I I didn't
 

22375
07:23:42,840 --> 07:23:45,150
sense it was cool like like I I I didn't
really know much about BCI at that point

22376
07:23:45,150 --> 07:23:45,160
really know much about BCI at that point
 

22377
07:23:45,160 --> 07:23:47,788
really know much about BCI at that point
either so I didn't know like what sort

22378
07:23:47,788 --> 07:23:47,798
either so I didn't know like what sort
 

22379
07:23:47,798 --> 07:23:51,628
either so I didn't know like what sort
of Step this was actually making um like

22380
07:23:51,628 --> 07:23:51,638
of Step this was actually making um like
 

22381
07:23:51,638 --> 07:23:53,590
of Step this was actually making um like
I didn't know if this was like a huge

22382
07:23:53,590 --> 07:23:53,600
I didn't know if this was like a huge
 

22383
07:23:53,600 --> 07:23:55,670
I didn't know if this was like a huge
deal or if this was just like okay this

22384
07:23:55,670 --> 07:23:55,680
deal or if this was just like okay this
 

22385
07:23:55,680 --> 07:23:58,230
deal or if this was just like okay this
is you know it's cool that we got this

22386
07:23:58,230 --> 07:23:58,240
is you know it's cool that we got this
 

22387
07:23:58,240 --> 07:24:00,190
is you know it's cool that we got this
far but we're actually hoping for

22388
07:24:00,190 --> 07:24:00,200
far but we're actually hoping for
 

22389
07:24:00,200 --> 07:24:02,030
far but we're actually hoping for
something like much better down the road

22390
07:24:02,030 --> 07:24:02,040
something like much better down the road
 

22391
07:24:02,040 --> 07:24:04,388
something like much better down the road
it's like okay I just thought that they

22392
07:24:04,388 --> 07:24:04,398
it's like okay I just thought that they
 

22393
07:24:04,398 --> 07:24:07,030
it's like okay I just thought that they
knew that it turned on so I was like

22394
07:24:07,030 --> 07:24:07,040
knew that it turned on so I was like
 

22395
07:24:07,040 --> 07:24:08,708
knew that it turned on so I was like
cool like this is this is cool well did

22396
07:24:08,708 --> 07:24:08,718
cool like this is this is cool well did
 

22397
07:24:08,718 --> 07:24:10,468
cool like this is this is cool well did
you like read up on the specs of the

22398
07:24:10,468 --> 07:24:10,478
you like read up on the specs of the
 

22399
07:24:10,478 --> 07:24:12,270
you like read up on the specs of the
hardware you get installed like the

22400
07:24:12,270 --> 07:24:12,280
hardware you get installed like the
 

22401
07:24:12,280 --> 07:24:14,868
hardware you get installed like the
number of threads kind I knew all of

22402
07:24:14,868 --> 07:24:14,878
number of threads kind I knew all of
 

22403
07:24:14,878 --> 07:24:17,270
number of threads kind I knew all of
that but it's all like It's All Greek to

22404
07:24:17,270 --> 07:24:17,280
that but it's all like It's All Greek to
 

22405
07:24:17,280 --> 07:24:21,430
that but it's all like It's All Greek to
me I was like okay threads 64 threads 16

22406
07:24:21,430 --> 07:24:21,440
me I was like okay threads 64 threads 16
 

22407
07:24:21,440 --> 07:24:24,110
me I was like okay threads 64 threads 16
electrodes 1,24

22408
07:24:24,110 --> 07:24:24,120
electrodes 1,24
 

22409
07:24:24,120 --> 07:24:27,708
electrodes 1,24
channels okay like like that that that

22410
07:24:27,708 --> 07:24:27,718
channels okay like like that that that
 

22411
07:24:27,718 --> 07:24:31,868
channels okay like like that that that
math checks out uh sounds right yeah

22412
07:24:31,868 --> 07:24:31,878
math checks out uh sounds right yeah
 

22413
07:24:31,878 --> 07:24:33,230
math checks out uh sounds right yeah
when was the first time you were able to

22414
07:24:33,230 --> 07:24:33,240
when was the first time you were able to
 

22415
07:24:33,240 --> 07:24:35,270
when was the first time you were able to
move a milous cursor I know it must have

22416
07:24:35,270 --> 07:24:35,280
move a milous cursor I know it must have
 

22417
07:24:35,280 --> 07:24:38,110
move a milous cursor I know it must have
been within the first maybe week a week

22418
07:24:38,110 --> 07:24:38,120
been within the first maybe week a week
 

22419
07:24:38,120 --> 07:24:40,590
been within the first maybe week a week
or two weeks that I was able to like

22420
07:24:40,590 --> 07:24:40,600
or two weeks that I was able to like
 

22421
07:24:40,600 --> 07:24:44,628
or two weeks that I was able to like
first move the cursor and again like it

22422
07:24:44,628 --> 07:24:44,638
first move the cursor and again like it
 

22423
07:24:44,638 --> 07:24:46,708
first move the cursor and again like it
kind of made sense to me like it it

22424
07:24:46,708 --> 07:24:46,718
kind of made sense to me like it it
 

22425
07:24:46,718 --> 07:24:48,948
kind of made sense to me like it it
didn't seem like that big of a deal like

22426
07:24:48,948 --> 07:24:48,958
didn't seem like that big of a deal like
 

22427
07:24:48,958 --> 07:24:53,308
didn't seem like that big of a deal like
it it it was like okay well how do I

22428
07:24:53,308 --> 07:24:53,318
it it it was like okay well how do I
 

22429
07:24:53,318 --> 07:24:55,990
it it it was like okay well how do I
explain this when everyone around you

22430
07:24:55,990 --> 07:24:56,000
explain this when everyone around you
 

22431
07:24:56,000 --> 07:24:57,868
explain this when everyone around you
starts clapping for something that

22432
07:24:57,868 --> 07:24:57,878
starts clapping for something that
 

22433
07:24:57,878 --> 07:25:01,868
starts clapping for something that
you've done it's it's easy to say okay

22434
07:25:01,868 --> 07:25:01,878
you've done it's it's easy to say okay
 

22435
07:25:01,878 --> 07:25:04,510
you've done it's it's easy to say okay
like I did something cool like that was

22436
07:25:04,510 --> 07:25:04,520
like I did something cool like that was
 

22437
07:25:04,520 --> 07:25:07,468
like I did something cool like that was
that was impressive in some way um what

22438
07:25:07,468 --> 07:25:07,478
that was impressive in some way um what
 

22439
07:25:07,478 --> 07:25:10,230
that was impressive in some way um what
exactly that meant what it was hadn't

22440
07:25:10,230 --> 07:25:10,240
exactly that meant what it was hadn't
 

22441
07:25:10,240 --> 07:25:11,670
exactly that meant what it was hadn't
really

22442
07:25:11,670 --> 07:25:11,680
really
 

22443
07:25:11,680 --> 07:25:17,990
really
like set in for me um so again I knew

22444
07:25:17,990 --> 07:25:18,000
like set in for me um so again I knew
 

22445
07:25:18,000 --> 07:25:23,990
like set in for me um so again I knew
that me trying to move a body part um

22446
07:25:23,990 --> 07:25:24,000
that me trying to move a body part um
 

22447
07:25:24,000 --> 07:25:28,308
that me trying to move a body part um
and then that being mapped um in some

22448
07:25:28,308 --> 07:25:28,318
and then that being mapped um in some
 

22449
07:25:28,318 --> 07:25:31,110
and then that being mapped um in some
sort of like machine learning algorithm

22450
07:25:31,110 --> 07:25:31,120
sort of like machine learning algorithm
 

22451
07:25:31,120 --> 07:25:34,548
sort of like machine learning algorithm
to be able to um identify like my brain

22452
07:25:34,548 --> 07:25:34,558
to be able to um identify like my brain
 

22453
07:25:34,558 --> 07:25:36,430
to be able to um identify like my brain
signals and then take that and give me

22454
07:25:36,430 --> 07:25:36,440
signals and then take that and give me
 

22455
07:25:36,440 --> 07:25:38,350
signals and then take that and give me
cursor control that all kind of made

22456
07:25:38,350 --> 07:25:38,360
cursor control that all kind of made
 

22457
07:25:38,360 --> 07:25:40,308
cursor control that all kind of made
sense to me I don't know like all the in

22458
07:25:40,308 --> 07:25:40,318
sense to me I don't know like all the in
 

22459
07:25:40,318 --> 07:25:42,070
sense to me I don't know like all the in
ins and outs of it but I was like there

22460
07:25:42,070 --> 07:25:42,080
ins and outs of it but I was like there
 

22461
07:25:42,080 --> 07:25:44,468
ins and outs of it but I was like there
are still signals in my brain firing

22462
07:25:44,468 --> 07:25:44,478
are still signals in my brain firing
 

22463
07:25:44,478 --> 07:25:46,350
are still signals in my brain firing
they just can't get through because

22464
07:25:46,350 --> 07:25:46,360
they just can't get through because
 

22465
07:25:46,360 --> 07:25:49,150
they just can't get through because
there's like a gap in my spinal cord and

22466
07:25:49,150 --> 07:25:49,160
there's like a gap in my spinal cord and
 

22467
07:25:49,160 --> 07:25:50,830
there's like a gap in my spinal cord and
so they just they can't get all the way

22468
07:25:50,830 --> 07:25:50,840
so they just they can't get all the way
 

22469
07:25:50,840 --> 07:25:53,510
so they just they can't get all the way
down and back up but they're still there

22470
07:25:53,510 --> 07:25:53,520
down and back up but they're still there
 

22471
07:25:53,520 --> 07:25:55,830
down and back up but they're still there
so when I move the cursor for the first

22472
07:25:55,830 --> 07:25:55,840
so when I move the cursor for the first
 

22473
07:25:55,840 --> 07:25:57,948
so when I move the cursor for the first
time I was like that's cool but I

22474
07:25:57,948 --> 07:25:57,958
time I was like that's cool but I
 

22475
07:25:57,958 --> 07:26:00,628
time I was like that's cool but I
expected that that should happen like it

22476
07:26:00,628 --> 07:26:00,638
expected that that should happen like it
 

22477
07:26:00,638 --> 07:26:04,070
expected that that should happen like it
made sense to me um when I moved the

22478
07:26:04,070 --> 07:26:04,080
made sense to me um when I moved the
 

22479
07:26:04,080 --> 07:26:08,270
made sense to me um when I moved the
cursor for the first time um with just

22480
07:26:08,270 --> 07:26:08,280
cursor for the first time um with just
 

22481
07:26:08,280 --> 07:26:10,070
cursor for the first time um with just
my mind without like physically trying

22482
07:26:10,070 --> 07:26:10,080
my mind without like physically trying
 

22483
07:26:10,080 --> 07:26:12,110
my mind without like physically trying
to move so I guess I can get into that

22484
07:26:12,110 --> 07:26:12,120
to move so I guess I can get into that
 

22485
07:26:12,120 --> 07:26:13,548
to move so I guess I can get into that
just a little bit like the difference

22486
07:26:13,548 --> 07:26:13,558
just a little bit like the difference
 

22487
07:26:13,558 --> 07:26:16,070
just a little bit like the difference
between attempted movement and imagine

22488
07:26:16,070 --> 07:26:16,080
between attempted movement and imagine
 

22489
07:26:16,080 --> 07:26:17,750
between attempted movement and imagine
movement yeah that's a fascinating

22490
07:26:17,750 --> 07:26:17,760
movement yeah that's a fascinating
 

22491
07:26:17,760 --> 07:26:20,070
movement yeah that's a fascinating
difference from one to the other yeah

22492
07:26:20,070 --> 07:26:20,080
difference from one to the other yeah
 

22493
07:26:20,080 --> 07:26:22,708
difference from one to the other yeah
yeah yeah so like attempted movement is

22494
07:26:22,708 --> 07:26:22,718
yeah yeah so like attempted movement is
 

22495
07:26:22,718 --> 07:26:26,990
yeah yeah so like attempted movement is
me physically trying to attempt to move

22496
07:26:26,990 --> 07:26:27,000
me physically trying to attempt to move
 

22497
07:26:27,000 --> 07:26:29,190
me physically trying to attempt to move
say my hand I try to attempt to move my

22498
07:26:29,190 --> 07:26:29,200
say my hand I try to attempt to move my
 

22499
07:26:29,200 --> 07:26:31,270
say my hand I try to attempt to move my
hand to the right to the left forward

22500
07:26:31,270 --> 07:26:31,280
hand to the right to the left forward
 

22501
07:26:31,280 --> 07:26:33,948
hand to the right to the left forward
and back um and that's all attempted

22502
07:26:33,948 --> 07:26:33,958
and back um and that's all attempted
 

22503
07:26:33,958 --> 07:26:36,388
and back um and that's all attempted
attempt to you know like lift my finger

22504
07:26:36,388 --> 07:26:36,398
attempt to you know like lift my finger
 

22505
07:26:36,398 --> 07:26:39,548
attempt to you know like lift my finger
up and down attempt to kick or something

22506
07:26:39,548 --> 07:26:39,558
up and down attempt to kick or something
 

22507
07:26:39,558 --> 07:26:41,750
up and down attempt to kick or something
um I'm physically trying to do all of

22508
07:26:41,750 --> 07:26:41,760
um I'm physically trying to do all of
 

22509
07:26:41,760 --> 07:26:44,430
um I'm physically trying to do all of
those things even if you can't see it

22510
07:26:44,430 --> 07:26:44,440
those things even if you can't see it
 

22511
07:26:44,440 --> 07:26:46,070
those things even if you can't see it
like I'm this would be like me

22512
07:26:46,070 --> 07:26:46,080
like I'm this would be like me
 

22513
07:26:46,080 --> 07:26:48,948
like I'm this would be like me
attempting to like shrug my shoulders or

22514
07:26:48,948 --> 07:26:48,958
attempting to like shrug my shoulders or
 

22515
07:26:48,958 --> 07:26:51,430
attempting to like shrug my shoulders or
something that's all attempted movement

22516
07:26:51,430 --> 07:26:51,440
something that's all attempted movement
 

22517
07:26:51,440 --> 07:26:55,388
something that's all attempted movement
um that all that's what I was doing for

22518
07:26:55,388 --> 07:26:55,398
um that all that's what I was doing for
 

22519
07:26:55,398 --> 07:26:58,868
um that all that's what I was doing for
the first couple of weeks when they were

22520
07:26:58,868 --> 07:26:58,878
the first couple of weeks when they were
 

22521
07:26:58,878 --> 07:27:00,308
the first couple of weeks when they were
going to give me cursor control when I

22522
07:27:00,308 --> 07:27:00,318
going to give me cursor control when I
 

22523
07:27:00,318 --> 07:27:02,670
going to give me cursor control when I
was doing body mapping it was attempt to

22524
07:27:02,670 --> 07:27:02,680
was doing body mapping it was attempt to
 

22525
07:27:02,680 --> 07:27:06,430
was doing body mapping it was attempt to
do this attempt to do that when um near

22526
07:27:06,430 --> 07:27:06,440
do this attempt to do that when um near
 

22527
07:27:06,440 --> 07:27:08,990
do this attempt to do that when um near
was telling me um

22528
07:27:08,990 --> 07:27:09,000
was telling me um
 

22529
07:27:09,000 --> 07:27:13,990
was telling me um
to like imagine doing it it like kind of

22530
07:27:13,990 --> 07:27:14,000
to like imagine doing it it like kind of
 

22531
07:27:14,000 --> 07:27:16,830
to like imagine doing it it like kind of
made sense to me but it's not something

22532
07:27:16,830 --> 07:27:16,840
made sense to me but it's not something
 

22533
07:27:16,840 --> 07:27:22,350
made sense to me but it's not something
that people practice like if you started

22534
07:27:22,350 --> 07:27:22,360
that people practice like if you started
 

22535
07:27:22,360 --> 07:27:27,110
that people practice like if you started
school um as a child and they said okay

22536
07:27:27,110 --> 07:27:27,120
school um as a child and they said okay
 

22537
07:27:27,120 --> 07:27:29,110
school um as a child and they said okay
write your name with this pencil and so

22538
07:27:29,110 --> 07:27:29,120
write your name with this pencil and so
 

22539
07:27:29,120 --> 07:27:31,468
write your name with this pencil and so
you do that like okay now imagine

22540
07:27:31,468 --> 07:27:31,478
you do that like okay now imagine
 

22541
07:27:31,478 --> 07:27:33,350
you do that like okay now imagine
writing your name with that pencil kids

22542
07:27:33,350 --> 07:27:33,360
writing your name with that pencil kids
 

22543
07:27:33,360 --> 07:27:36,670
writing your name with that pencil kids
would think uh like I guess like that

22544
07:27:36,670 --> 07:27:36,680
would think uh like I guess like that
 

22545
07:27:36,680 --> 07:27:39,030
would think uh like I guess like that
kind of makes sense and they would do it

22546
07:27:39,030 --> 07:27:39,040
kind of makes sense and they would do it
 

22547
07:27:39,040 --> 07:27:40,910
kind of makes sense and they would do it
um but that's not something we're taught

22548
07:27:40,910 --> 07:27:40,920
um but that's not something we're taught
 

22549
07:27:40,920 --> 07:27:42,590
um but that's not something we're taught
it's all like how to do things

22550
07:27:42,590 --> 07:27:42,600
it's all like how to do things
 

22551
07:27:42,600 --> 07:27:45,510
it's all like how to do things
physically we think about like thought

22552
07:27:45,510 --> 07:27:45,520
physically we think about like thought
 

22553
07:27:45,520 --> 07:27:47,070
physically we think about like thought
experiments and things but that's not

22554
07:27:47,070 --> 07:27:47,080
experiments and things but that's not
 

22555
07:27:47,080 --> 07:27:49,350
experiments and things but that's not
like that's not like a physical action

22556
07:27:49,350 --> 07:27:49,360
like that's not like a physical action
 

22557
07:27:49,360 --> 07:27:51,190
like that's not like a physical action
of doing things it's more like what you

22558
07:27:51,190 --> 07:27:51,200
of doing things it's more like what you
 

22559
07:27:51,200 --> 07:27:53,270
of doing things it's more like what you
would do in certain situations so

22560
07:27:53,270 --> 07:27:53,280
would do in certain situations so
 

22561
07:27:53,280 --> 07:27:55,270
would do in certain situations so
imagine movement it it never really

22562
07:27:55,270 --> 07:27:55,280
imagine movement it it never really
 

22563
07:27:55,280 --> 07:27:58,230
imagine movement it it never really
connected with me like I guess you could

22564
07:27:58,230 --> 07:27:58,240
connected with me like I guess you could
 

22565
07:27:58,240 --> 07:28:00,110
connected with me like I guess you could
maybe describe it as like a Prof

22566
07:28:00,110 --> 07:28:00,120
maybe describe it as like a Prof
 

22567
07:28:00,120 --> 07:28:02,510
maybe describe it as like a Prof
professional athlete like has swinging a

22568
07:28:02,510 --> 07:28:02,520
professional athlete like has swinging a
 

22569
07:28:02,520 --> 07:28:04,110
professional athlete like has swinging a
baseball bat or swinging like a golf

22570
07:28:04,110 --> 07:28:04,120
baseball bat or swinging like a golf
 

22571
07:28:04,120 --> 07:28:06,110
baseball bat or swinging like a golf
club like imagine what you're supposed

22572
07:28:06,110 --> 07:28:06,120
club like imagine what you're supposed
 

22573
07:28:06,120 --> 07:28:09,670
club like imagine what you're supposed
to do but then you go right to that and

22574
07:28:09,670 --> 07:28:09,680
to do but then you go right to that and
 

22575
07:28:09,680 --> 07:28:12,190
to do but then you go right to that and
physically do it like you then you get a

22576
07:28:12,190 --> 07:28:12,200
physically do it like you then you get a
 

22577
07:28:12,200 --> 07:28:13,830
physically do it like you then you get a
bat in your hand and then you do what

22578
07:28:13,830 --> 07:28:13,840
bat in your hand and then you do what
 

22579
07:28:13,840 --> 07:28:15,670
bat in your hand and then you do what
you've been imagining and so I don't

22580
07:28:15,670 --> 07:28:15,680
you've been imagining and so I don't
 

22581
07:28:15,680 --> 07:28:17,708
you've been imagining and so I don't
have that like connection so telling me

22582
07:28:17,708 --> 07:28:17,718
have that like connection so telling me
 

22583
07:28:17,718 --> 07:28:20,110
have that like connection so telling me
to imagine something versus attempting

22584
07:28:20,110 --> 07:28:20,120
to imagine something versus attempting
 

22585
07:28:20,120 --> 07:28:22,670
to imagine something versus attempting
it it just there wasn't a lot that I

22586
07:28:22,670 --> 07:28:22,680
it it just there wasn't a lot that I
 

22587
07:28:22,680 --> 07:28:25,270
it it just there wasn't a lot that I
could do there um mentally I just kind

22588
07:28:25,270 --> 07:28:25,280
could do there um mentally I just kind
 

22589
07:28:25,280 --> 07:28:28,468
could do there um mentally I just kind
of had to accept what was going on and

22590
07:28:28,468 --> 07:28:28,478
of had to accept what was going on and
 

22591
07:28:28,478 --> 07:28:31,628
of had to accept what was going on and
try um but the attempted moving thing it

22592
07:28:31,628 --> 07:28:31,638
try um but the attempted moving thing it
 

22593
07:28:31,638 --> 07:28:33,868
try um but the attempted moving thing it
all made sense to me like if I try to

22594
07:28:33,868 --> 07:28:33,878
all made sense to me like if I try to
 

22595
07:28:33,878 --> 07:28:37,070
all made sense to me like if I try to
move then there's a signal being sent in

22596
07:28:37,070 --> 07:28:37,080
move then there's a signal being sent in
 

22597
07:28:37,080 --> 07:28:39,230
move then there's a signal being sent in
my brain and as long as they can pick

22598
07:28:39,230 --> 07:28:39,240
my brain and as long as they can pick
 

22599
07:28:39,240 --> 07:28:40,868
my brain and as long as they can pick
that up then they should be able to map

22600
07:28:40,868 --> 07:28:40,878
that up then they should be able to map
 

22601
07:28:40,878 --> 07:28:43,070
that up then they should be able to map
it to what I'm trying to do and so when

22602
07:28:43,070 --> 07:28:43,080
it to what I'm trying to do and so when
 

22603
07:28:43,080 --> 07:28:45,750
it to what I'm trying to do and so when
I first moved the cursor like that it it

22604
07:28:45,750 --> 07:28:45,760
I first moved the cursor like that it it
 

22605
07:28:45,760 --> 07:28:48,830
I first moved the cursor like that it it
was it was like yes this should happen

22606
07:28:48,830 --> 07:28:48,840
was it was like yes this should happen
 

22607
07:28:48,840 --> 07:28:50,830
was it was like yes this should happen
like I'm I'm not surprised by that well

22608
07:28:50,830 --> 07:28:50,840
like I'm I'm not surprised by that well
 

22609
07:28:50,840 --> 07:28:52,388
like I'm I'm not surprised by that well
can you clarify is there supposed to be

22610
07:28:52,388 --> 07:28:52,398
can you clarify is there supposed to be
 

22611
07:28:52,398 --> 07:28:53,868
can you clarify is there supposed to be
a difference between imagine movement

22612
07:28:53,868 --> 07:28:53,878
a difference between imagine movement
 

22613
07:28:53,878 --> 07:28:56,670
a difference between imagine movement
and attempted movement yeah just that in

22614
07:28:56,670 --> 07:28:56,680
and attempted movement yeah just that in
 

22615
07:28:56,680 --> 07:28:58,910
and attempted movement yeah just that in
Imagine movement you're not attempting

22616
07:28:58,910 --> 07:28:58,920
Imagine movement you're not attempting
 

22617
07:28:58,920 --> 07:29:01,708
Imagine movement you're not attempting
to move at all so it's you're like

22618
07:29:01,708 --> 07:29:01,718
to move at all so it's you're like
 

22619
07:29:01,718 --> 07:29:05,190
to move at all so it's you're like
visualizing doing and then theoretically

22620
07:29:05,190 --> 07:29:05,200
visualizing doing and then theoretically
 

22621
07:29:05,200 --> 07:29:06,308
visualizing doing and then theoretically
is that supposed to be a different part

22622
07:29:06,308 --> 07:29:06,318
is that supposed to be a different part
 

22623
07:29:06,318 --> 07:29:08,150
is that supposed to be a different part
of the brain that lights up in those two

22624
07:29:08,150 --> 07:29:08,160
of the brain that lights up in those two
 

22625
07:29:08,160 --> 07:29:09,788
of the brain that lights up in those two
different situations yeah not

22626
07:29:09,788 --> 07:29:09,798
different situations yeah not
 

22627
07:29:09,798 --> 07:29:11,350
different situations yeah not
necessarily I think all these signals

22628
07:29:11,350 --> 07:29:11,360
necessarily I think all these signals
 

22629
07:29:11,360 --> 07:29:13,628
necessarily I think all these signals
can still be represented in Moto cortex

22630
07:29:13,628 --> 07:29:13,638
can still be represented in Moto cortex
 

22631
07:29:13,638 --> 07:29:15,110
can still be represented in Moto cortex
but the the difference I think has to do

22632
07:29:15,110 --> 07:29:15,120
but the the difference I think has to do
 

22633
07:29:15,120 --> 07:29:17,030
but the the difference I think has to do
with the naturalness of imagining

22634
07:29:17,030 --> 07:29:17,040
with the naturalness of imagining
 

22635
07:29:17,040 --> 07:29:18,948
with the naturalness of imagining
something inverse got it attempting it

22636
07:29:18,948 --> 07:29:18,958
something inverse got it attempting it
 

22637
07:29:18,958 --> 07:29:20,708
something inverse got it attempting it
and sort the fatigue of that over time

22638
07:29:20,708 --> 07:29:20,718
and sort the fatigue of that over time
 

22639
07:29:20,718 --> 07:29:25,350
and sort the fatigue of that over time
and by the way on the mic is bliss uh so

22640
07:29:25,350 --> 07:29:25,360
and by the way on the mic is bliss uh so
 

22641
07:29:25,360 --> 07:29:27,190
and by the way on the mic is bliss uh so
like this is just different ways to

22642
07:29:27,190 --> 07:29:27,200
like this is just different ways to
 

22643
07:29:27,200 --> 07:29:29,468
like this is just different ways to
prompt you to kind of get to the thing

22644
07:29:29,468 --> 07:29:29,478
prompt you to kind of get to the thing
 

22645
07:29:29,478 --> 07:29:32,070
prompt you to kind of get to the thing
that you're around that yeah attemp to

22646
07:29:32,070 --> 07:29:32,080
that you're around that yeah attemp to
 

22647
07:29:32,080 --> 07:29:35,030
that you're around that yeah attemp to
movement does sound like the right thing

22648
07:29:35,030 --> 07:29:35,040
movement does sound like the right thing
 

22649
07:29:35,040 --> 07:29:37,830
movement does sound like the right thing
try yeah I mean it makes sense to me cuz

22650
07:29:37,830 --> 07:29:37,840
try yeah I mean it makes sense to me cuz
 

22651
07:29:37,840 --> 07:29:39,868
try yeah I mean it makes sense to me cuz
imagine for me I'll be I would start

22652
07:29:39,868 --> 07:29:39,878
imagine for me I'll be I would start
 

22653
07:29:39,878 --> 07:29:42,708
imagine for me I'll be I would start
visualizing like in my mind visualizing

22654
07:29:42,708 --> 07:29:42,718
visualizing like in my mind visualizing
 

22655
07:29:42,718 --> 07:29:44,510
visualizing like in my mind visualizing
attempted I would actually start trying

22656
07:29:44,510 --> 07:29:44,520
attempted I would actually start trying
 

22657
07:29:44,520 --> 07:29:46,868
attempted I would actually start trying
to like yeah there's a I mean I you know

22658
07:29:46,868 --> 07:29:46,878
to like yeah there's a I mean I you know
 

22659
07:29:46,878 --> 07:29:48,548
to like yeah there's a I mean I you know
I did like Combat Sports my whole life

22660
07:29:48,548 --> 07:29:48,558
I did like Combat Sports my whole life
 

22661
07:29:48,558 --> 07:29:51,628
I did like Combat Sports my whole life
like wrestling when I'm imagining a move

22662
07:29:51,628 --> 07:29:51,638
like wrestling when I'm imagining a move
 

22663
07:29:51,638 --> 07:29:55,190
like wrestling when I'm imagining a move
see I'm like moving my muscle exactly

22664
07:29:55,190 --> 07:29:55,200
see I'm like moving my muscle exactly
 

22665
07:29:55,200 --> 07:29:56,708
see I'm like moving my muscle exactly
like there's a there is a bit of an

22666
07:29:56,708 --> 07:29:56,718
like there's a there is a bit of an
 

22667
07:29:56,718 --> 07:29:58,948
like there's a there is a bit of an
activation almost versus like

22668
07:29:58,948 --> 07:29:58,958
activation almost versus like
 

22669
07:29:58,958 --> 07:30:00,590
activation almost versus like
visualizing yourself like a picture

22670
07:30:00,590 --> 07:30:00,600
visualizing yourself like a picture
 

22671
07:30:00,600 --> 07:30:03,670
visualizing yourself like a picture
doing it yeah it's something that I feel

22672
07:30:03,670 --> 07:30:03,680
doing it yeah it's something that I feel
 

22673
07:30:03,680 --> 07:30:05,708
doing it yeah it's something that I feel
like naturally anyone would do if you

22674
07:30:05,708 --> 07:30:05,718
like naturally anyone would do if you
 

22675
07:30:05,718 --> 07:30:07,270
like naturally anyone would do if you
try to tell someone to imagine doing

22676
07:30:07,270 --> 07:30:07,280
try to tell someone to imagine doing
 

22677
07:30:07,280 --> 07:30:09,230
try to tell someone to imagine doing
something they might close their eyes

22678
07:30:09,230 --> 07:30:09,240
something they might close their eyes
 

22679
07:30:09,240 --> 07:30:11,910
something they might close their eyes
and then start physically doing it um

22680
07:30:11,910 --> 07:30:11,920
and then start physically doing it um
 

22681
07:30:11,920 --> 07:30:15,788
and then start physically doing it um
but it it's just just click yeah it's

22682
07:30:15,788 --> 07:30:15,798
but it it's just just click yeah it's
 

22683
07:30:15,798 --> 07:30:18,388
but it it's just just click yeah it's
it's hard it was very hard at the

22684
07:30:18,388 --> 07:30:18,398
it's hard it was very hard at the
 

22685
07:30:18,398 --> 07:30:20,548
it's hard it was very hard at the
beginning but attempted worked attempted

22686
07:30:20,548 --> 07:30:20,558
beginning but attempted worked attempted
 

22687
07:30:20,558 --> 07:30:23,070
beginning but attempted worked attempted
worked it worked just like it should

22688
07:30:23,070 --> 07:30:23,080
worked it worked just like it should
 

22689
07:30:23,080 --> 07:30:26,788
worked it worked just like it should
work like work like a charm um remember

22690
07:30:26,788 --> 07:30:26,798
work like work like a charm um remember
 

22691
07:30:26,798 --> 07:30:28,150
work like work like a charm um remember
there was like one Tuesday we were

22692
07:30:28,150 --> 07:30:28,160
there was like one Tuesday we were
 

22693
07:30:28,160 --> 07:30:30,230
there was like one Tuesday we were
messing around and I think I get what

22694
07:30:30,230 --> 07:30:30,240
messing around and I think I get what
 

22695
07:30:30,240 --> 07:30:31,708
messing around and I think I get what
swear word you used but there's a swear

22696
07:30:31,708 --> 07:30:31,718
swear word you used but there's a swear
 

22697
07:30:31,718 --> 07:30:32,830
swear word you used but there's a swear
word that came out of your mouth when

22698
07:30:32,830 --> 07:30:32,840
word that came out of your mouth when
 

22699
07:30:32,840 --> 07:30:33,990
word that came out of your mouth when
you figured out you could just do the

22700
07:30:33,990 --> 07:30:34,000
you figured out you could just do the
 

22701
07:30:34,000 --> 07:30:38,628
you figured out you could just do the
direct cursor control yeah that's it it

22702
07:30:38,628 --> 07:30:38,638
direct cursor control yeah that's it it
 

22703
07:30:38,638 --> 07:30:41,830
direct cursor control yeah that's it it
blew my mind like no pun intended blew

22704
07:30:41,830 --> 07:30:41,840
blew my mind like no pun intended blew
 

22705
07:30:41,840 --> 07:30:43,948
blew my mind like no pun intended blew
my mind when I

22706
07:30:43,948 --> 07:30:43,958
my mind when I
 

22707
07:30:43,958 --> 07:30:48,590
my mind when I
first um moved the cursor just with my

22708
07:30:48,590 --> 07:30:48,600
first um moved the cursor just with my
 

22709
07:30:48,600 --> 07:30:51,990
first um moved the cursor just with my
thoughts and not attempting to move it's

22710
07:30:51,990 --> 07:30:52,000
thoughts and not attempting to move it's
 

22711
07:30:52,000 --> 07:30:55,270
thoughts and not attempting to move it's
something that I found um like over the

22712
07:30:55,270 --> 07:30:55,280
something that I found um like over the
 

22713
07:30:55,280 --> 07:30:58,190
something that I found um like over the
couple of weeks like building up to that

22714
07:30:58,190 --> 07:30:58,200
couple of weeks like building up to that
 

22715
07:30:58,200 --> 07:31:02,350
couple of weeks like building up to that
um that as I get better cursor controls

22716
07:31:02,350 --> 07:31:02,360
um that as I get better cursor controls
 

22717
07:31:02,360 --> 07:31:08,308
um that as I get better cursor controls
like the model uh gets better um then it

22718
07:31:08,308 --> 07:31:08,318
like the model uh gets better um then it
 

22719
07:31:08,318 --> 07:31:12,910
like the model uh gets better um then it
gets easier for me to like um like I

22720
07:31:12,910 --> 07:31:12,920
gets easier for me to like um like I
 

22721
07:31:12,920 --> 07:31:15,990
gets easier for me to like um like I
don't have to attempt as much to move it

22722
07:31:15,990 --> 07:31:16,000
don't have to attempt as much to move it
 

22723
07:31:16,000 --> 07:31:18,308
don't have to attempt as much to move it
and part of that is something that I had

22724
07:31:18,308 --> 07:31:18,318
and part of that is something that I had
 

22725
07:31:18,318 --> 07:31:21,430
and part of that is something that I had
even talked with them about um when I

22726
07:31:21,430 --> 07:31:21,440
even talked with them about um when I
 

22727
07:31:21,440 --> 07:31:24,708
even talked with them about um when I
was watching the signals of my brain one

22728
07:31:24,708 --> 07:31:24,718
was watching the signals of my brain one
 

22729
07:31:24,718 --> 07:31:27,750
was watching the signals of my brain one
day I was watching when I like attempted

22730
07:31:27,750 --> 07:31:27,760
day I was watching when I like attempted
 

22731
07:31:27,760 --> 07:31:30,430
day I was watching when I like attempted
to move to the right and I watched the

22732
07:31:30,430 --> 07:31:30,440
to move to the right and I watched the
 

22733
07:31:30,440 --> 07:31:33,350
to move to the right and I watched the
screen as like I saw the spikes like I

22734
07:31:33,350 --> 07:31:33,360
screen as like I saw the spikes like I
 

22735
07:31:33,360 --> 07:31:34,708
screen as like I saw the spikes like I
was seeing the spike the signal was

22736
07:31:34,708 --> 07:31:34,718
was seeing the spike the signal was
 

22737
07:31:34,718 --> 07:31:37,270
was seeing the spike the signal was
being sent before I was actually

22738
07:31:37,270 --> 07:31:37,280
being sent before I was actually
 

22739
07:31:37,280 --> 07:31:40,868
being sent before I was actually
attempting to move um I imagine just

22740
07:31:40,868 --> 07:31:40,878
attempting to move um I imagine just
 

22741
07:31:40,878 --> 07:31:43,868
attempting to move um I imagine just
because you know when you go to say move

22742
07:31:43,868 --> 07:31:43,878
because you know when you go to say move
 

22743
07:31:43,878 --> 07:31:45,948
because you know when you go to say move
your hand or any body part that signal

22744
07:31:45,948 --> 07:31:45,958
your hand or any body part that signal
 

22745
07:31:45,958 --> 07:31:47,948
your hand or any body part that signal
gets sent before you're actually moving

22746
07:31:47,948 --> 07:31:47,958
gets sent before you're actually moving
 

22747
07:31:47,958 --> 07:31:49,830
gets sent before you're actually moving
has to make it all the way down and back

22748
07:31:49,830 --> 07:31:49,840
has to make it all the way down and back
 

22749
07:31:49,840 --> 07:31:51,230
has to make it all the way down and back
up before you actually do any sort of

22750
07:31:51,230 --> 07:31:51,240
up before you actually do any sort of
 

22751
07:31:51,240 --> 07:31:55,150
up before you actually do any sort of
movement so there's a delay there and I

22752
07:31:55,150 --> 07:31:55,160
movement so there's a delay there and I
 

22753
07:31:55,160 --> 07:31:57,110
movement so there's a delay there and I
noticed that there was something going

22754
07:31:57,110 --> 07:31:57,120
noticed that there was something going
 

22755
07:31:57,120 --> 07:31:59,030
noticed that there was something going
on in my brain before I was actually

22756
07:31:59,030 --> 07:31:59,040
on in my brain before I was actually
 

22757
07:31:59,040 --> 07:32:00,830
on in my brain before I was actually
attempting to move

22758
07:32:00,830 --> 07:32:00,840
attempting to move
 

22759
07:32:00,840 --> 07:32:04,830
attempting to move
that um my brain was like anticipating

22760
07:32:04,830 --> 07:32:04,840
that um my brain was like anticipating
 

22761
07:32:04,840 --> 07:32:08,510
that um my brain was like anticipating
what I wanted to do and that all started

22762
07:32:08,510 --> 07:32:08,520
what I wanted to do and that all started
 

22763
07:32:08,520 --> 07:32:12,708
what I wanted to do and that all started
sort of um I don't know like percolating

22764
07:32:12,708 --> 07:32:12,718
sort of um I don't know like percolating
 

22765
07:32:12,718 --> 07:32:14,868
sort of um I don't know like percolating
in my brain like it just it was just

22766
07:32:14,868 --> 07:32:14,878
in my brain like it just it was just
 

22767
07:32:14,878 --> 07:32:17,468
in my brain like it just it was just
sort of there like always in the back

22768
07:32:17,468 --> 07:32:17,478
sort of there like always in the back
 

22769
07:32:17,478 --> 07:32:19,910
sort of there like always in the back
like that's so weird that it could do

22770
07:32:19,910 --> 07:32:19,920
like that's so weird that it could do
 

22771
07:32:19,920 --> 07:32:22,388
like that's so weird that it could do
that it kind of makes sense but I wonder

22772
07:32:22,388 --> 07:32:22,398
that it kind of makes sense but I wonder
 

22773
07:32:22,398 --> 07:32:25,308
that it kind of makes sense but I wonder
what that means um as far as like using

22774
07:32:25,308 --> 07:32:25,318
what that means um as far as like using
 

22775
07:32:25,318 --> 07:32:29,590
what that means um as far as like using
the neuralink and um you know and then

22776
07:32:29,590 --> 07:32:29,600
the neuralink and um you know and then
 

22777
07:32:29,600 --> 07:32:30,388
the neuralink and um you know and then
as

22778
07:32:30,388 --> 07:32:30,398
as
 

22779
07:32:30,398 --> 07:32:32,388
as
I was playing around with the attempted

22780
07:32:32,388 --> 07:32:32,398
I was playing around with the attempted
 

22781
07:32:32,398 --> 07:32:33,628
I was playing around with the attempted
movement and playing around with the

22782
07:32:33,628 --> 07:32:33,638
movement and playing around with the
 

22783
07:32:33,638 --> 07:32:35,868
movement and playing around with the
cursor and I saw that like as the cursor

22784
07:32:35,868 --> 07:32:35,878
cursor and I saw that like as the cursor
 

22785
07:32:35,878 --> 07:32:38,590
cursor and I saw that like as the cursor
control got better that it

22786
07:32:38,590 --> 07:32:38,600
control got better that it
 

22787
07:32:38,600 --> 07:32:42,948
control got better that it
was anticipating my movements um and

22788
07:32:42,948 --> 07:32:42,958
was anticipating my movements um and
 

22789
07:32:42,958 --> 07:32:44,910
was anticipating my movements um and
what I wanted it to do like cursor

22790
07:32:44,910 --> 07:32:44,920
what I wanted it to do like cursor
 

22791
07:32:44,920 --> 07:32:46,670
what I wanted it to do like cursor
movements what I wanted to do a bit

22792
07:32:46,670 --> 07:32:46,680
movements what I wanted to do a bit
 

22793
07:32:46,680 --> 07:32:49,910
movements what I wanted to do a bit
better and a bit better and then one day

22794
07:32:49,910 --> 07:32:49,920
better and a bit better and then one day
 

22795
07:32:49,920 --> 07:32:52,350
better and a bit better and then one day
I just randomly as I was playing web

22796
07:32:52,350 --> 07:32:52,360
I just randomly as I was playing web
 

22797
07:32:52,360 --> 07:32:57,910
I just randomly as I was playing web
grid I um like looked at a Target before

22798
07:32:57,910 --> 07:32:57,920
grid I um like looked at a Target before
 

22799
07:32:57,920 --> 07:32:59,788
grid I um like looked at a Target before
I had started like attempting to move I

22800
07:32:59,788 --> 07:32:59,798
I had started like attempting to move I
 

22801
07:32:59,798 --> 07:33:02,388
I had started like attempting to move I
was just trying to like get over like

22802
07:33:02,388 --> 07:33:02,398
was just trying to like get over like
 

22803
07:33:02,398 --> 07:33:05,308
was just trying to like get over like
train um my eyes to start looking ahead

22804
07:33:05,308 --> 07:33:05,318
train um my eyes to start looking ahead
 

22805
07:33:05,318 --> 07:33:07,350
train um my eyes to start looking ahead
like okay this is the target I'm on but

22806
07:33:07,350 --> 07:33:07,360
like okay this is the target I'm on but
 

22807
07:33:07,360 --> 07:33:09,350
like okay this is the target I'm on but
if I look over here to this target I

22808
07:33:09,350 --> 07:33:09,360
if I look over here to this target I
 

22809
07:33:09,360 --> 07:33:11,190
if I look over here to this target I
know I can like maybe be a bit quicker

22810
07:33:11,190 --> 07:33:11,200
know I can like maybe be a bit quicker
 

22811
07:33:11,200 --> 07:33:12,990
know I can like maybe be a bit quicker
getting there and I looked over and the

22812
07:33:12,990 --> 07:33:13,000
getting there and I looked over and the
 

22813
07:33:13,000 --> 07:33:16,750
getting there and I looked over and the
cursor just shot over it it was wild

22814
07:33:16,750 --> 07:33:16,760
cursor just shot over it it was wild
 

22815
07:33:16,760 --> 07:33:19,270
cursor just shot over it it was wild
like it I had to take a step back like I

22816
07:33:19,270 --> 07:33:19,280
like it I had to take a step back like I
 

22817
07:33:19,280 --> 07:33:21,230
like it I had to take a step back like I
was like this should not be happening

22818
07:33:21,230 --> 07:33:21,240
was like this should not be happening
 

22819
07:33:21,240 --> 07:33:23,308
was like this should not be happening
all day I was just smiling I was so

22820
07:33:23,308 --> 07:33:23,318
all day I was just smiling I was so
 

22821
07:33:23,318 --> 07:33:25,308
all day I was just smiling I was so
giddy I was like guys do you know that

22822
07:33:25,308 --> 07:33:25,318
giddy I was like guys do you know that
 

22823
07:33:25,318 --> 07:33:27,270
giddy I was like guys do you know that
this works like I can just think it and

22824
07:33:27,270 --> 07:33:27,280
this works like I can just think it and
 

22825
07:33:27,280 --> 07:33:30,230
this works like I can just think it and
it happens which like they' all

22826
07:33:30,230 --> 07:33:30,240
it happens which like they' all
 

22827
07:33:30,240 --> 07:33:31,788
it happens which like they' all
been saying this entire time like I

22828
07:33:31,788 --> 07:33:31,798
been saying this entire time like I
 

22829
07:33:31,798 --> 07:33:33,750
been saying this entire time like I
can't believe like you're doing all this

22830
07:33:33,750 --> 07:33:33,760
can't believe like you're doing all this
 

22831
07:33:33,760 --> 07:33:35,308
can't believe like you're doing all this
with your mind I'm like yeah but is it

22832
07:33:35,308 --> 07:33:35,318
with your mind I'm like yeah but is it
 

22833
07:33:35,318 --> 07:33:37,388
with your mind I'm like yeah but is it
really with my mind like I'm attempting

22834
07:33:37,388 --> 07:33:37,398
really with my mind like I'm attempting
 

22835
07:33:37,398 --> 07:33:38,910
really with my mind like I'm attempting
to move and it's just picking that up so

22836
07:33:38,910 --> 07:33:38,920
to move and it's just picking that up so
 

22837
07:33:38,920 --> 07:33:40,708
to move and it's just picking that up so
it doesn't feel like it's with my mind

22838
07:33:40,708 --> 07:33:40,718
it doesn't feel like it's with my mind
 

22839
07:33:40,718 --> 07:33:42,150
it doesn't feel like it's with my mind
but when I moved it for the first time

22840
07:33:42,150 --> 07:33:42,160
but when I moved it for the first time
 

22841
07:33:42,160 --> 07:33:47,750
but when I moved it for the first time
like that it was oh man it like it made

22842
07:33:47,750 --> 07:33:47,760
like that it was oh man it like it made
 

22843
07:33:47,760 --> 07:33:51,110
like that it was oh man it like it made
me think that this technology that what

22844
07:33:51,110 --> 07:33:51,120
me think that this technology that what
 

22845
07:33:51,120 --> 07:33:53,468
me think that this technology that what
I'm doing is actually

22846
07:33:53,468 --> 07:33:53,478
I'm doing is actually
 

22847
07:33:53,478 --> 07:33:56,110
I'm doing is actually
way way more impressive than I ever

22848
07:33:56,110 --> 07:33:56,120
way way more impressive than I ever
 

22849
07:33:56,120 --> 07:33:57,990
way way more impressive than I ever
thought it was way cooler than I ever

22850
07:33:57,990 --> 07:33:58,000
thought it was way cooler than I ever
 

22851
07:33:58,000 --> 07:34:00,308
thought it was way cooler than I ever
thought and it just open open up a whole

22852
07:34:00,308 --> 07:34:00,318
thought and it just open open up a whole
 

22853
07:34:00,318 --> 07:34:03,548
thought and it just open open up a whole
new world of possibilities of like what

22854
07:34:03,548 --> 07:34:03,558
new world of possibilities of like what
 

22855
07:34:03,558 --> 07:34:05,270
new world of possibilities of like what
could possibly happen with this

22856
07:34:05,270 --> 07:34:05,280
could possibly happen with this
 

22857
07:34:05,280 --> 07:34:07,230
could possibly happen with this
technology and what I might be able to

22858
07:34:07,230 --> 07:34:07,240
technology and what I might be able to
 

22859
07:34:07,240 --> 07:34:09,110
technology and what I might be able to
be capable of with it because you had

22860
07:34:09,110 --> 07:34:09,120
be capable of with it because you had
 

22861
07:34:09,120 --> 07:34:10,750
be capable of with it because you had
felt for the first time like this was

22862
07:34:10,750 --> 07:34:10,760
felt for the first time like this was
 

22863
07:34:10,760 --> 07:34:13,110
felt for the first time like this was
digital telepathy like you're

22864
07:34:13,110 --> 07:34:13,120
digital telepathy like you're
 

22865
07:34:13,120 --> 07:34:15,110
digital telepathy like you're
controlling a digital device with your

22866
07:34:15,110 --> 07:34:15,120
controlling a digital device with your
 

22867
07:34:15,120 --> 07:34:18,030
controlling a digital device with your
mind y I mean this a that's a real

22868
07:34:18,030 --> 07:34:18,040
mind y I mean this a that's a real
 

22869
07:34:18,040 --> 07:34:19,868
mind y I mean this a that's a real
moment of Discovery that's really cool

22870
07:34:19,868 --> 07:34:19,878
moment of Discovery that's really cool
 

22871
07:34:19,878 --> 07:34:21,948
moment of Discovery that's really cool
like you've discovered something I've

22872
07:34:21,948 --> 07:34:21,958
like you've discovered something I've
 

22873
07:34:21,958 --> 07:34:24,868
like you've discovered something I've
seen like scientists talk about like a

22874
07:34:24,868 --> 07:34:24,878
seen like scientists talk about like a
 

22875
07:34:24,878 --> 07:34:27,150
seen like scientists talk about like a
big aha moment you know like Nobel prize

22876
07:34:27,150 --> 07:34:27,160
big aha moment you know like Nobel prize
 

22877
07:34:27,160 --> 07:34:29,750
big aha moment you know like Nobel prize
winning they'll have this like

22878
07:34:29,750 --> 07:34:29,760
winning they'll have this like
 

22879
07:34:29,760 --> 07:34:32,750
winning they'll have this like
holy crap yeah like that's what that's

22880
07:34:32,750 --> 07:34:32,760
holy crap yeah like that's what that's
 

22881
07:34:32,760 --> 07:34:34,590
holy crap yeah like that's what that's
what it felt like like I didn't feel

22882
07:34:34,590 --> 07:34:34,600
what it felt like like I didn't feel
 

22883
07:34:34,600 --> 07:34:36,948
what it felt like like I didn't feel
like like I felt like I had discovered

22884
07:34:36,948 --> 07:34:36,958
like like I felt like I had discovered
 

22885
07:34:36,958 --> 07:34:38,868
like like I felt like I had discovered
something but for me maybe not

22886
07:34:38,868 --> 07:34:38,878
something but for me maybe not
 

22887
07:34:38,878 --> 07:34:41,830
something but for me maybe not
necessarily for like the World At Large

22888
07:34:41,830 --> 07:34:41,840
necessarily for like the World At Large
 

22889
07:34:41,840 --> 07:34:44,308
necessarily for like the World At Large
or like this field at large it just felt

22890
07:34:44,308 --> 07:34:44,318
or like this field at large it just felt
 

22891
07:34:44,318 --> 07:34:47,910
or like this field at large it just felt
like an aaot moment for me like oh this

22892
07:34:47,910 --> 07:34:47,920
like an aaot moment for me like oh this
 

22893
07:34:47,920 --> 07:34:51,430
like an aaot moment for me like oh this
works like obviously it works um and so

22894
07:34:51,430 --> 07:34:51,440
works like obviously it works um and so
 

22895
07:34:51,440 --> 07:34:54,190
works like obviously it works um and so
that's what I do like all the time now

22896
07:34:54,190 --> 07:34:54,200
that's what I do like all the time now
 

22897
07:34:54,200 --> 07:34:57,230
that's what I do like all the time now
uh I kind of intermix um the attempted

22898
07:34:57,230 --> 07:34:57,240
uh I kind of intermix um the attempted
 

22899
07:34:57,240 --> 07:35:00,430
uh I kind of intermix um the attempted
movement and uh imagined movement I do

22900
07:35:00,430 --> 07:35:00,440
movement and uh imagined movement I do
 

22901
07:35:00,440 --> 07:35:03,350
movement and uh imagined movement I do
it all like together because I found

22902
07:35:03,350 --> 07:35:03,360
it all like together because I found
 

22903
07:35:03,360 --> 07:35:07,070
it all like together because I found
that there is some interplay with it

22904
07:35:07,070 --> 07:35:07,080
that there is some interplay with it
 

22905
07:35:07,080 --> 07:35:10,070
that there is some interplay with it
that maximizes efficiency with the

22906
07:35:10,070 --> 07:35:10,080
that maximizes efficiency with the
 

22907
07:35:10,080 --> 07:35:12,308
that maximizes efficiency with the
cursor so it's not all like one or the

22908
07:35:12,308 --> 07:35:12,318
cursor so it's not all like one or the
 

22909
07:35:12,318 --> 07:35:14,510
cursor so it's not all like one or the
other it's not all just I only use

22910
07:35:14,510 --> 07:35:14,520
other it's not all just I only use
 

22911
07:35:14,520 --> 07:35:16,590
other it's not all just I only use
attempted or I only use like imagine

22912
07:35:16,590 --> 07:35:16,600
attempted or I only use like imagine
 

22913
07:35:16,600 --> 07:35:20,388
attempted or I only use like imagine
movements it's more I use them um in

22914
07:35:20,388 --> 07:35:20,398
movements it's more I use them um in
 

22915
07:35:20,398 --> 07:35:23,548
movements it's more I use them um in
parallel and uh I can do one or the

22916
07:35:23,548 --> 07:35:23,558
parallel and uh I can do one or the
 

22917
07:35:23,558 --> 07:35:26,350
parallel and uh I can do one or the
other I can just completely think about

22918
07:35:26,350 --> 07:35:26,360
other I can just completely think about
 

22919
07:35:26,360 --> 07:35:29,868
other I can just completely think about
um whatever I'm doing but um I don't

22920
07:35:29,868 --> 07:35:29,878
um whatever I'm doing but um I don't
 

22921
07:35:29,878 --> 07:35:31,468
um whatever I'm doing but um I don't
know I I like to play around with it I

22922
07:35:31,468 --> 07:35:31,478
know I I like to play around with it I
 

22923
07:35:31,478 --> 07:35:33,270
know I I like to play around with it I
also like to just experiment with these

22924
07:35:33,270 --> 07:35:33,280
also like to just experiment with these
 

22925
07:35:33,280 --> 07:35:35,230
also like to just experiment with these
things like every now and again I'll get

22926
07:35:35,230 --> 07:35:35,240
things like every now and again I'll get
 

22927
07:35:35,240 --> 07:35:37,788
things like every now and again I'll get
this idea in my head like hm I wonder if

22928
07:35:37,788 --> 07:35:37,798
this idea in my head like hm I wonder if
 

22929
07:35:37,798 --> 07:35:39,510
this idea in my head like hm I wonder if
this works and I'll just start doing it

22930
07:35:39,510 --> 07:35:39,520
this works and I'll just start doing it
 

22931
07:35:39,520 --> 07:35:40,948
this works and I'll just start doing it
and then afterwards I'll tell them by

22932
07:35:40,948 --> 07:35:40,958
and then afterwards I'll tell them by
 

22933
07:35:40,958 --> 07:35:42,548
and then afterwards I'll tell them by
the way I wasn't doing that like you

22934
07:35:42,548 --> 07:35:42,558
the way I wasn't doing that like you
 

22935
07:35:42,558 --> 07:35:45,750
the way I wasn't doing that like you
guys wanted me to um I was I I thought

22936
07:35:45,750 --> 07:35:45,760
guys wanted me to um I was I I thought
 

22937
07:35:45,760 --> 07:35:47,510
guys wanted me to um I was I I thought
of something and I wanted to try it and

22938
07:35:47,510 --> 07:35:47,520
of something and I wanted to try it and
 

22939
07:35:47,520 --> 07:35:49,830
of something and I wanted to try it and
so I did it seems like it works so maybe

22940
07:35:49,830 --> 07:35:49,840
so I did it seems like it works so maybe
 

22941
07:35:49,840 --> 07:35:51,830
so I did it seems like it works so maybe
we should like explore that a little bit

22942
07:35:51,830 --> 07:35:51,840
we should like explore that a little bit
 

22943
07:35:51,840 --> 07:35:53,190
we should like explore that a little bit
so I think that Discovery is not just

22944
07:35:53,190 --> 07:35:53,200
so I think that Discovery is not just
 

22945
07:35:53,200 --> 07:35:55,230
so I think that Discovery is not just
for you at least from my perspective

22946
07:35:55,230 --> 07:35:55,240
for you at least from my perspective
 

22947
07:35:55,240 --> 07:35:56,910
for you at least from my perspective
that's a discovery

22948
07:35:56,910 --> 07:35:56,920
that's a discovery
 

22949
07:35:56,920 --> 07:35:59,628
that's a discovery
for everyone else who ever uses in your

22950
07:35:59,628 --> 07:35:59,638
for everyone else who ever uses in your
 

22951
07:35:59,638 --> 07:36:02,350
for everyone else who ever uses in your
link that this is possible like I don't

22952
07:36:02,350 --> 07:36:02,360
link that this is possible like I don't
 

22953
07:36:02,360 --> 07:36:03,788
link that this is possible like I don't
think that's an obvious thing that this

22954
07:36:03,788 --> 07:36:03,798
think that's an obvious thing that this
 

22955
07:36:03,798 --> 07:36:06,308
think that's an obvious thing that this
is even possible it's like uh I was

22956
07:36:06,308 --> 07:36:06,318
is even possible it's like uh I was
 

22957
07:36:06,318 --> 07:36:08,708
is even possible it's like uh I was
saying to Bliss earlier uh it's like the

22958
07:36:08,708 --> 07:36:08,718
saying to Bliss earlier uh it's like the
 

22959
07:36:08,718 --> 07:36:10,670
saying to Bliss earlier uh it's like the
4minute mile people thought it was

22960
07:36:10,670 --> 07:36:10,680
4minute mile people thought it was
 

22961
07:36:10,680 --> 07:36:12,788
4minute mile people thought it was
impossible to run a mile in four minutes

22962
07:36:12,788 --> 07:36:12,798
impossible to run a mile in four minutes
 

22963
07:36:12,798 --> 07:36:14,948
impossible to run a mile in four minutes
and once the first person did it then

22964
07:36:14,948 --> 07:36:14,958
and once the first person did it then
 

22965
07:36:14,958 --> 07:36:16,990
and once the first person did it then
everyone just started doing it so like

22966
07:36:16,990 --> 07:36:17,000
everyone just started doing it so like
 

22967
07:36:17,000 --> 07:36:19,070
everyone just started doing it so like
just to show that it's possible that

22968
07:36:19,070 --> 07:36:19,080
just to show that it's possible that
 

22969
07:36:19,080 --> 07:36:20,910
just to show that it's possible that
paves the way to like anyone can now do

22970
07:36:20,910 --> 07:36:20,920
paves the way to like anyone can now do
 

22971
07:36:20,920 --> 07:36:22,150
paves the way to like anyone can now do
it that's the thing that's actually

22972
07:36:22,150 --> 07:36:22,160
it that's the thing that's actually
 

22973
07:36:22,160 --> 07:36:23,830
it that's the thing that's actually
possible you don't need to do the

22974
07:36:23,830 --> 07:36:23,840
possible you don't need to do the
 

22975
07:36:23,840 --> 07:36:26,590
possible you don't need to do the
attempted movement you just go Direct

22976
07:36:26,590 --> 07:36:26,600
attempted movement you just go Direct
 

22977
07:36:26,600 --> 07:36:29,388
attempted movement you just go Direct
that's crazy that is crazy it is crazy

22978
07:36:29,388 --> 07:36:29,398
that's crazy that is crazy it is crazy
 

22979
07:36:29,398 --> 07:36:31,948
that's crazy that is crazy it is crazy
yeah uh for people who don't know can

22980
07:36:31,948 --> 07:36:31,958
yeah uh for people who don't know can
 

22981
07:36:31,958 --> 07:36:34,190
yeah uh for people who don't know can
you explain how the link app works you

22982
07:36:34,190 --> 07:36:34,200
you explain how the link app works you
 

22983
07:36:34,200 --> 07:36:36,910
you explain how the link app works you
have an amazing stream on the topic your

22984
07:36:36,910 --> 07:36:36,920
have an amazing stream on the topic your
 

22985
07:36:36,920 --> 07:36:40,110
have an amazing stream on the topic your
first stream I think on X uh describing

22986
07:36:40,110 --> 07:36:40,120
first stream I think on X uh describing
 

22987
07:36:40,120 --> 07:36:43,030
first stream I think on X uh describing
the app uh can can you just describe how

22988
07:36:43,030 --> 07:36:43,040
the app uh can can you just describe how
 

22989
07:36:43,040 --> 07:36:45,948
the app uh can can you just describe how
it works yeah so it's just an app that

22990
07:36:45,948 --> 07:36:45,958
it works yeah so it's just an app that
 

22991
07:36:45,958 --> 07:36:50,868
it works yeah so it's just an app that
Nur link created um to help me interact

22992
07:36:50,868 --> 07:36:50,878
Nur link created um to help me interact
 

22993
07:36:50,878 --> 07:36:53,788
Nur link created um to help me interact
with a computer so on the link app uh

22994
07:36:53,788 --> 07:36:53,798
with a computer so on the link app uh
 

22995
07:36:53,798 --> 07:36:56,910
with a computer so on the link app uh
there are a few different settings and

22996
07:36:56,910 --> 07:36:56,920
there are a few different settings and
 

22997
07:36:56,920 --> 07:36:59,548
there are a few different settings and
different uh modes and things I can do

22998
07:36:59,548 --> 07:36:59,558
different uh modes and things I can do
 

22999
07:36:59,558 --> 07:37:01,670
different uh modes and things I can do
on it so there's like the body mapping

23000
07:37:01,670 --> 07:37:01,680
on it so there's like the body mapping
 

23001
07:37:01,680 --> 07:37:04,670
on it so there's like the body mapping
which we kind of touched on um there's a

23002
07:37:04,670 --> 07:37:04,680
which we kind of touched on um there's a
 

23003
07:37:04,680 --> 07:37:08,548
which we kind of touched on um there's a
calibration um calibration is how I

23004
07:37:08,548 --> 07:37:08,558
calibration um calibration is how I
 

23005
07:37:08,558 --> 07:37:11,230
calibration um calibration is how I
actually get cursor control so

23006
07:37:11,230 --> 07:37:11,240
actually get cursor control so
 

23007
07:37:11,240 --> 07:37:14,308
actually get cursor control so
calibrating what's going on in my brain

23008
07:37:14,308 --> 07:37:14,318
calibrating what's going on in my brain
 

23009
07:37:14,318 --> 07:37:18,270
calibrating what's going on in my brain
to uh translate that into cursor control

23010
07:37:18,270 --> 07:37:18,280
to uh translate that into cursor control
 

23011
07:37:18,280 --> 07:37:23,150
to uh translate that into cursor control
so it will pop out um models what what

23012
07:37:23,150 --> 07:37:23,160
so it will pop out um models what what
 

23013
07:37:23,160 --> 07:37:26,388
so it will pop out um models what what
they use I think is like time so it

23014
07:37:26,388 --> 07:37:26,398
they use I think is like time so it
 

23015
07:37:26,398 --> 07:37:28,190
they use I think is like time so it
would be you know five minutes in

23016
07:37:28,190 --> 07:37:28,200
would be you know five minutes in
 

23017
07:37:28,200 --> 07:37:31,150
would be you know five minutes in
calibration will give me um so good of a

23018
07:37:31,150 --> 07:37:31,160
calibration will give me um so good of a
 

23019
07:37:31,160 --> 07:37:33,110
calibration will give me um so good of a
model and then if I'm in it for 10

23020
07:37:33,110 --> 07:37:33,120
model and then if I'm in it for 10
 

23021
07:37:33,120 --> 07:37:35,548
model and then if I'm in it for 10
minutes and 15 minutes uh the models

23022
07:37:35,548 --> 07:37:35,558
minutes and 15 minutes uh the models
 

23023
07:37:35,558 --> 07:37:39,350
minutes and 15 minutes uh the models
will progressively get better and um so

23024
07:37:39,350 --> 07:37:39,360
will progressively get better and um so
 

23025
07:37:39,360 --> 07:37:41,150
will progressively get better and um so
you know the longer I'm in it generally

23026
07:37:41,150 --> 07:37:41,160
you know the longer I'm in it generally
 

23027
07:37:41,160 --> 07:37:43,468
you know the longer I'm in it generally
the um better the models will get that's

23028
07:37:43,468 --> 07:37:43,478
the um better the models will get that's
 

23029
07:37:43,478 --> 07:37:45,110
the um better the models will get that's
really cool cuz you often refer to the

23030
07:37:45,110 --> 07:37:45,120
really cool cuz you often refer to the
 

23031
07:37:45,120 --> 07:37:47,150
really cool cuz you often refer to the
models the model is the thing that's

23032
07:37:47,150 --> 07:37:47,160
models the model is the thing that's
 

23033
07:37:47,160 --> 07:37:48,548
models the model is the thing that's
constructed once you go through the

23034
07:37:48,548 --> 07:37:48,558
constructed once you go through the
 

23035
07:37:48,558 --> 07:37:50,308
constructed once you go through the
calibration step and then you also

23036
07:37:50,308 --> 07:37:50,318
calibration step and then you also
 

23037
07:37:50,318 --> 07:37:51,830
calibration step and then you also
talked about some sometimes sometimes

23038
07:37:51,830 --> 07:37:51,840
talked about some sometimes sometimes
 

23039
07:37:51,840 --> 07:37:54,030
talked about some sometimes sometimes
you'll play like a really difficult game

23040
07:37:54,030 --> 07:37:54,040
you'll play like a really difficult game
 

23041
07:37:54,040 --> 07:37:55,990
you'll play like a really difficult game
like snake just to see how good the

23042
07:37:55,990 --> 07:37:56,000
like snake just to see how good the
 

23043
07:37:56,000 --> 07:37:58,510
like snake just to see how good the
model is yeah yeah so snake is kind of

23044
07:37:58,510 --> 07:37:58,520
model is yeah yeah so snake is kind of
 

23045
07:37:58,520 --> 07:38:01,030
model is yeah yeah so snake is kind of
like my litm best for models if I can

23046
07:38:01,030 --> 07:38:01,040
like my litm best for models if I can
 

23047
07:38:01,040 --> 07:38:04,030
like my litm best for models if I can
control snake decently well then I I

23048
07:38:04,030 --> 07:38:04,040
control snake decently well then I I
 

23049
07:38:04,040 --> 07:38:06,548
control snake decently well then I I
know I have a pretty good model so yeah

23050
07:38:06,548 --> 07:38:06,558
know I have a pretty good model so yeah
 

23051
07:38:06,558 --> 07:38:08,388
know I have a pretty good model so yeah
the link app has all of those it has web

23052
07:38:08,388 --> 07:38:08,398
the link app has all of those it has web
 

23053
07:38:08,398 --> 07:38:11,190
the link app has all of those it has web
Grid in it now um it's also how I like

23054
07:38:11,190 --> 07:38:11,200
Grid in it now um it's also how I like
 

23055
07:38:11,200 --> 07:38:13,590
Grid in it now um it's also how I like
connect to the computer just in general

23056
07:38:13,590 --> 07:38:13,600
connect to the computer just in general
 

23057
07:38:13,600 --> 07:38:16,150
connect to the computer just in general
um so uh they've given me a lot of like

23058
07:38:16,150 --> 07:38:16,160
um so uh they've given me a lot of like
 

23059
07:38:16,160 --> 07:38:18,590
um so uh they've given me a lot of like
voice controls with it at this point so

23060
07:38:18,590 --> 07:38:18,600
voice controls with it at this point so
 

23061
07:38:18,600 --> 07:38:21,070
voice controls with it at this point so
I can you know say like connect or

23062
07:38:21,070 --> 07:38:21,080
I can you know say like connect or
 

23063
07:38:21,080 --> 07:38:24,308
I can you know say like connect or
implant disconnect and um as long as I

23064
07:38:24,308 --> 07:38:24,318
implant disconnect and um as long as I
 

23065
07:38:24,318 --> 07:38:27,468
implant disconnect and um as long as I
have uh that charger handy then I can

23066
07:38:27,468 --> 07:38:27,478
have uh that charger handy then I can
 

23067
07:38:27,478 --> 07:38:28,990
have uh that charger handy then I can
connect to it so the charger is also how

23068
07:38:28,990 --> 07:38:29,000
connect to it so the charger is also how
 

23069
07:38:29,000 --> 07:38:30,910
connect to it so the charger is also how
I connect to the link app to connect to

23070
07:38:30,910 --> 07:38:30,920
I connect to the link app to connect to
 

23071
07:38:30,920 --> 07:38:33,548
I connect to the link app to connect to
the computer I have to have um the

23072
07:38:33,548 --> 07:38:33,558
the computer I have to have um the
 

23073
07:38:33,558 --> 07:38:36,468
the computer I have to have um the
implant charger uh over my head when I

23074
07:38:36,468 --> 07:38:36,478
implant charger uh over my head when I
 

23075
07:38:36,478 --> 07:38:38,788
implant charger uh over my head when I
want to connect to have it wake up cuz

23076
07:38:38,788 --> 07:38:38,798
want to connect to have it wake up cuz
 

23077
07:38:38,798 --> 07:38:41,270
want to connect to have it wake up cuz
the implant's in hibernation mode uh

23078
07:38:41,270 --> 07:38:41,280
the implant's in hibernation mode uh
 

23079
07:38:41,280 --> 07:38:44,070
the implant's in hibernation mode uh
like always when I'm not using it um I

23080
07:38:44,070 --> 07:38:44,080
like always when I'm not using it um I
 

23081
07:38:44,080 --> 07:38:45,388
like always when I'm not using it um I
think there's a setting to like wake it

23082
07:38:45,388 --> 07:38:45,398
think there's a setting to like wake it
 

23083
07:38:45,398 --> 07:38:49,350
think there's a setting to like wake it
up every you know so long so we could

23084
07:38:49,350 --> 07:38:49,360
up every you know so long so we could
 

23085
07:38:49,360 --> 07:38:51,628
up every you know so long so we could
set it to half an hour or 5 hours or

23086
07:38:51,628 --> 07:38:51,638
set it to half an hour or 5 hours or
 

23087
07:38:51,638 --> 07:38:53,670
set it to half an hour or 5 hours or
something if I just want it to wake up

23088
07:38:53,670 --> 07:38:53,680
something if I just want it to wake up
 

23089
07:38:53,680 --> 07:38:56,868
something if I just want it to wake up
uh periodically um so yeah I'll like

23090
07:38:56,868 --> 07:38:56,878
uh periodically um so yeah I'll like
 

23091
07:38:56,878 --> 07:38:59,070
uh periodically um so yeah I'll like
connect to the link app and then go

23092
07:38:59,070 --> 07:38:59,080
connect to the link app and then go
 

23093
07:38:59,080 --> 07:39:01,788
connect to the link app and then go
through all sorts of things uh

23094
07:39:01,788 --> 07:39:01,798
through all sorts of things uh
 

23095
07:39:01,798 --> 07:39:03,468
through all sorts of things uh
calibration for the day maybe body

23096
07:39:03,468 --> 07:39:03,478
calibration for the day maybe body
 

23097
07:39:03,478 --> 07:39:05,628
calibration for the day maybe body
mapping I have like I made them give me

23098
07:39:05,628 --> 07:39:05,638
mapping I have like I made them give me
 

23099
07:39:05,638 --> 07:39:09,270
mapping I have like I made them give me
like a little homework tab um because I

23100
07:39:09,270 --> 07:39:09,280
like a little homework tab um because I
 

23101
07:39:09,280 --> 07:39:12,190
like a little homework tab um because I
am very forgetful and I forget to do

23102
07:39:12,190 --> 07:39:12,200
am very forgetful and I forget to do
 

23103
07:39:12,200 --> 07:39:14,868
am very forgetful and I forget to do
things a lot um so I have like a lot of

23104
07:39:14,868 --> 07:39:14,878
things a lot um so I have like a lot of
 

23105
07:39:14,878 --> 07:39:16,990
things a lot um so I have like a lot of
data collection things uh that they want

23106
07:39:16,990 --> 07:39:17,000
data collection things uh that they want
 

23107
07:39:17,000 --> 07:39:19,430
data collection things uh that they want
me to do is the body mapping part of the

23108
07:39:19,430 --> 07:39:19,440
me to do is the body mapping part of the
 

23109
07:39:19,440 --> 07:39:20,910
me to do is the body mapping part of the
data collection or is that also part of

23110
07:39:20,910 --> 07:39:20,920
data collection or is that also part of
 

23111
07:39:20,920 --> 07:39:22,670
data collection or is that also part of
the yeah it is it's something that they

23112
07:39:22,670 --> 07:39:22,680
the yeah it is it's something that they
 

23113
07:39:22,680 --> 07:39:25,990
the yeah it is it's something that they
want me to do um daily which I've been

23114
07:39:25,990 --> 07:39:26,000
want me to do um daily which I've been
 

23115
07:39:26,000 --> 07:39:27,548
want me to do um daily which I've been
slacking on because I've been doing so

23116
07:39:27,548 --> 07:39:27,558
slacking on because I've been doing so
 

23117
07:39:27,558 --> 07:39:29,868
slacking on because I've been doing so
much media and traveling so much so I've

23118
07:39:29,868 --> 07:39:29,878
much media and traveling so much so I've
 

23119
07:39:29,878 --> 07:39:32,070
much media and traveling so much so I've
been you got super famous yeah I've I've

23120
07:39:32,070 --> 07:39:32,080
been you got super famous yeah I've I've
 

23121
07:39:32,080 --> 07:39:35,150
been you got super famous yeah I've I've
been a terrible um first candidate for

23122
07:39:35,150 --> 07:39:35,160
been a terrible um first candidate for
 

23123
07:39:35,160 --> 07:39:37,910
been a terrible um first candidate for
how much I've uh been slacking on my

23124
07:39:37,910 --> 07:39:37,920
how much I've uh been slacking on my
 

23125
07:39:37,920 --> 07:39:40,150
how much I've uh been slacking on my
homework um but yeah it's just something

23126
07:39:40,150 --> 07:39:40,160
homework um but yeah it's just something
 

23127
07:39:40,160 --> 07:39:42,510
homework um but yeah it's just something
that they want me to do every day to you

23128
07:39:42,510 --> 07:39:42,520
that they want me to do every day to you
 

23129
07:39:42,520 --> 07:39:46,830
that they want me to do every day to you
know track um how uh well the neuralink

23130
07:39:46,830 --> 07:39:46,840
know track um how uh well the neuralink
 

23131
07:39:46,840 --> 07:39:48,548
know track um how uh well the neuralink
is performing over time and have

23132
07:39:48,548 --> 07:39:48,558
is performing over time and have
 

23133
07:39:48,558 --> 07:39:50,388
is performing over time and have
something to give I imagine to give to

23134
07:39:50,388 --> 07:39:50,398
something to give I imagine to give to
 

23135
07:39:50,398 --> 07:39:52,590
something to give I imagine to give to
the FDA to you know create all sorts of

23136
07:39:52,590 --> 07:39:52,600
the FDA to you know create all sorts of
 

23137
07:39:52,600 --> 07:39:55,670
the FDA to you know create all sorts of
fancy charts and stuff and show like hey

23138
07:39:55,670 --> 07:39:55,680
fancy charts and stuff and show like hey
 

23139
07:39:55,680 --> 07:39:57,388
fancy charts and stuff and show like hey
this is what the neuralink this is how

23140
07:39:57,388 --> 07:39:57,398
this is what the neuralink this is how
 

23141
07:39:57,398 --> 07:39:59,788
this is what the neuralink this is how
it's performing you know day one versus

23142
07:39:59,788 --> 07:39:59,798
it's performing you know day one versus
 

23143
07:39:59,798 --> 07:40:02,150
it's performing you know day one versus
day 90 versus day 180 and things like

23144
07:40:02,150 --> 07:40:02,160
day 90 versus day 180 and things like
 

23145
07:40:02,160 --> 07:40:03,990
day 90 versus day 180 and things like
that what's the calibration step like is

23146
07:40:03,990 --> 07:40:04,000
that what's the calibration step like is
 

23147
07:40:04,000 --> 07:40:07,910
that what's the calibration step like is
it is it like move left move right it's

23148
07:40:07,910 --> 07:40:07,920
it is it like move left move right it's
 

23149
07:40:07,920 --> 07:40:09,670
it is it like move left move right it's
uh a bubble game so there will be like

23150
07:40:09,670 --> 07:40:09,680
uh a bubble game so there will be like
 

23151
07:40:09,680 --> 07:40:12,150
uh a bubble game so there will be like
yellow bubbles that pop up on the screen

23152
07:40:12,150 --> 07:40:12,160
yellow bubbles that pop up on the screen
 

23153
07:40:12,160 --> 07:40:15,708
yellow bubbles that pop up on the screen
at first it is open loop so open loop

23154
07:40:15,708 --> 07:40:15,718
at first it is open loop so open loop
 

23155
07:40:15,718 --> 07:40:18,070
at first it is open loop so open loop
this is something that I still don't

23156
07:40:18,070 --> 07:40:18,080
this is something that I still don't
 

23157
07:40:18,080 --> 07:40:20,190
this is something that I still don't
fully understand the open loop and

23158
07:40:20,190 --> 07:40:20,200
fully understand the open loop and
 

23159
07:40:20,200 --> 07:40:22,030
fully understand the open loop and
closed loop thing me and Bliss talked

23160
07:40:22,030 --> 07:40:22,040
closed loop thing me and Bliss talked
 

23161
07:40:22,040 --> 07:40:23,350
closed loop thing me and Bliss talked
for a long time about the difference

23162
07:40:23,350 --> 07:40:23,360
for a long time about the difference
 

23163
07:40:23,360 --> 07:40:24,510
for a long time about the difference
between the two from the on the

23164
07:40:24,510 --> 07:40:24,520
between the two from the on the
 

23165
07:40:24,520 --> 07:40:26,548
between the two from the on the
technical side so it' be great to hear

23166
07:40:26,548 --> 07:40:26,558
technical side so it' be great to hear
 

23167
07:40:26,558 --> 07:40:30,510
technical side so it' be great to hear
your okay your side of the story Loop is

23168
07:40:30,510 --> 07:40:30,520
your okay your side of the story Loop is
 

23169
07:40:30,520 --> 07:40:32,948
your okay your side of the story Loop is
basically um I have no control over the

23170
07:40:32,948 --> 07:40:32,958
basically um I have no control over the
 

23171
07:40:32,958 --> 07:40:36,150
basically um I have no control over the
cursor um the cursor will be moving on

23172
07:40:36,150 --> 07:40:36,160
cursor um the cursor will be moving on
 

23173
07:40:36,160 --> 07:40:38,150
cursor um the cursor will be moving on
its own across the screen and I am

23174
07:40:38,150 --> 07:40:38,160
its own across the screen and I am
 

23175
07:40:38,160 --> 07:40:42,230
its own across the screen and I am
following by intention um the cursor to

23176
07:40:42,230 --> 07:40:42,240
following by intention um the cursor to
 

23177
07:40:42,240 --> 07:40:45,430
following by intention um the cursor to
different Bubbles and then my um the

23178
07:40:45,430 --> 07:40:45,440
different Bubbles and then my um the
 

23179
07:40:45,440 --> 07:40:48,190
different Bubbles and then my um the
algorithm is training off of what like

23180
07:40:48,190 --> 07:40:48,200
algorithm is training off of what like
 

23181
07:40:48,200 --> 07:40:50,430
algorithm is training off of what like
the signals it's getting are as I'm

23182
07:40:50,430 --> 07:40:50,440
the signals it's getting are as I'm
 

23183
07:40:50,440 --> 07:40:51,628
the signals it's getting are as I'm
doing this there are a couple different

23184
07:40:51,628 --> 07:40:51,638
doing this there are a couple different
 

23185
07:40:51,638 --> 07:40:53,628
doing this there are a couple different
ways that they've done it they call it

23186
07:40:53,628 --> 07:40:53,638
ways that they've done it they call it
 

23187
07:40:53,638 --> 07:40:55,948
ways that they've done it they call it
Center out Target so there will be a

23188
07:40:55,948 --> 07:40:55,958
Center out Target so there will be a
 

23189
07:40:55,958 --> 07:40:57,388
Center out Target so there will be a
bubble in the middle and then eight

23190
07:40:57,388 --> 07:40:57,398
bubble in the middle and then eight
 

23191
07:40:57,398 --> 07:40:59,590
bubble in the middle and then eight
bubbles around that and the cursor will

23192
07:40:59,590 --> 07:40:59,600
bubbles around that and the cursor will
 

23193
07:40:59,600 --> 07:41:02,670
bubbles around that and the cursor will
go from uh the middle uh to one side so

23194
07:41:02,670 --> 07:41:02,680
go from uh the middle uh to one side so
 

23195
07:41:02,680 --> 07:41:05,590
go from uh the middle uh to one side so
say middle to left back to Middle to up

23196
07:41:05,590 --> 07:41:05,600
say middle to left back to Middle to up
 

23197
07:41:05,600 --> 07:41:07,990
say middle to left back to Middle to up
to Middle like up right and they'll do

23198
07:41:07,990 --> 07:41:08,000
to Middle like up right and they'll do
 

23199
07:41:08,000 --> 07:41:10,190
to Middle like up right and they'll do
that all the way around uh the circle

23200
07:41:10,190 --> 07:41:10,200
that all the way around uh the circle
 

23201
07:41:10,200 --> 07:41:12,868
that all the way around uh the circle
and I will follow that cursor um the

23202
07:41:12,868 --> 07:41:12,878
and I will follow that cursor um the
 

23203
07:41:12,878 --> 07:41:15,990
and I will follow that cursor um the
whole time and then it will train off of

23204
07:41:15,990 --> 07:41:16,000
whole time and then it will train off of
 

23205
07:41:16,000 --> 07:41:19,308
whole time and then it will train off of
my intentions what it is expecting my

23206
07:41:19,308 --> 07:41:19,318
my intentions what it is expecting my
 

23207
07:41:19,318 --> 07:41:21,510
my intentions what it is expecting my
intentions to be um throughout the whole

23208
07:41:21,510 --> 07:41:21,520
intentions to be um throughout the whole
 

23209
07:41:21,520 --> 07:41:24,230
intentions to be um throughout the whole
process can you actually speak to when

23210
07:41:24,230 --> 07:41:24,240
process can you actually speak to when
 

23211
07:41:24,240 --> 07:41:26,388
process can you actually speak to when
you say follow yes you don't mean with

23212
07:41:26,388 --> 07:41:26,398
you say follow yes you don't mean with
 

23213
07:41:26,398 --> 07:41:28,590
you say follow yes you don't mean with
your eyes you mean with your intentions

23214
07:41:28,590 --> 07:41:28,600
your eyes you mean with your intentions
 

23215
07:41:28,600 --> 07:41:30,910
your eyes you mean with your intentions
yeah so uh generally for calibration I'm

23216
07:41:30,910 --> 07:41:30,920
yeah so uh generally for calibration I'm
 

23217
07:41:30,920 --> 07:41:32,948
yeah so uh generally for calibration I'm
doing attempted movements uh because I

23218
07:41:32,948 --> 07:41:32,958
doing attempted movements uh because I
 

23219
07:41:32,958 --> 07:41:36,468
doing attempted movements uh because I
think it works better I think the better

23220
07:41:36,468 --> 07:41:36,478
think it works better I think the better
 

23221
07:41:36,478 --> 07:41:40,430
think it works better I think the better
models as I progress through calibration

23222
07:41:40,430 --> 07:41:40,440
models as I progress through calibration
 

23223
07:41:40,440 --> 07:41:41,948
models as I progress through calibration
um make it

23224
07:41:41,948 --> 07:41:41,958
um make it
 

23225
07:41:41,958 --> 07:41:45,628
um make it
easier um to use imagine movement wait

23226
07:41:45,628 --> 07:41:45,638
easier um to use imagine movement wait
 

23227
07:41:45,638 --> 07:41:49,548
easier um to use imagine movement wait
wait so calibrated on attempted movement

23228
07:41:49,548 --> 07:41:49,558
wait so calibrated on attempted movement
 

23229
07:41:49,558 --> 07:41:52,788
wait so calibrated on attempted movement
will create a model that makes it really

23230
07:41:52,788 --> 07:41:52,798
will create a model that makes it really
 

23231
07:41:52,798 --> 07:41:55,910
will create a model that makes it really
effective for you to then use the force

23232
07:41:55,910 --> 07:41:55,920
effective for you to then use the force
 

23233
07:41:55,920 --> 07:42:00,628
effective for you to then use the force
yes I've tried um doing calibration with

23234
07:42:00,628 --> 07:42:00,638
yes I've tried um doing calibration with
 

23235
07:42:00,638 --> 07:42:03,468
yes I've tried um doing calibration with
imagined movement and it just doesn't

23236
07:42:03,468 --> 07:42:03,478
imagined movement and it just doesn't
 

23237
07:42:03,478 --> 07:42:06,150
imagined movement and it just doesn't
work as well um for some reason so that

23238
07:42:06,150 --> 07:42:06,160
work as well um for some reason so that
 

23239
07:42:06,160 --> 07:42:07,990
work as well um for some reason so that
was the center out targets there's also

23240
07:42:07,990 --> 07:42:08,000
was the center out targets there's also
 

23241
07:42:08,000 --> 07:42:10,190
was the center out targets there's also
one where you know a random Target will

23242
07:42:10,190 --> 07:42:10,200
one where you know a random Target will
 

23243
07:42:10,200 --> 07:42:12,270
one where you know a random Target will
pop up on the screen and it's the same I

23244
07:42:12,270 --> 07:42:12,280
pop up on the screen and it's the same I
 

23245
07:42:12,280 --> 07:42:15,388
pop up on the screen and it's the same I
just like move I follow along um with

23246
07:42:15,388 --> 07:42:15,398
just like move I follow along um with
 

23247
07:42:15,398 --> 07:42:16,788
just like move I follow along um with
wherever the cursor is to that Target

23248
07:42:16,788 --> 07:42:16,798
wherever the cursor is to that Target
 

23249
07:42:16,798 --> 07:42:19,468
wherever the cursor is to that Target
all across the screen um I've tried

23250
07:42:19,468 --> 07:42:19,478
all across the screen um I've tried
 

23251
07:42:19,478 --> 07:42:23,150
all across the screen um I've tried
those with imagine movement and for some

23252
07:42:23,150 --> 07:42:23,160
those with imagine movement and for some
 

23253
07:42:23,160 --> 07:42:27,270
those with imagine movement and for some
reason models just don't

23254
07:42:27,270 --> 07:42:27,280
reason models just don't
 

23255
07:42:27,280 --> 07:42:29,708
reason models just don't
um they don't give

23256
07:42:29,708 --> 07:42:29,718
um they don't give
 

23257
07:42:29,718 --> 07:42:32,308
um they don't give
as high level as quality when we get

23258
07:42:32,308 --> 07:42:32,318
as high level as quality when we get
 

23259
07:42:32,318 --> 07:42:35,830
as high level as quality when we get
into Clos Loop um I haven't played

23260
07:42:35,830 --> 07:42:35,840
into Clos Loop um I haven't played
 

23261
07:42:35,840 --> 07:42:37,948
into Clos Loop um I haven't played
around with it a ton so maybe like the

23262
07:42:37,948 --> 07:42:37,958
around with it a ton so maybe like the
 

23263
07:42:37,958 --> 07:42:39,430
around with it a ton so maybe like the
different ways we're doing calibration

23264
07:42:39,430 --> 07:42:39,440
different ways we're doing calibration
 

23265
07:42:39,440 --> 07:42:42,308
different ways we're doing calibration
now might make it a bit better but what

23266
07:42:42,308 --> 07:42:42,318
now might make it a bit better but what
 

23267
07:42:42,318 --> 07:42:45,910
now might make it a bit better but what
I've found is there will be a point in

23268
07:42:45,910 --> 07:42:45,920
I've found is there will be a point in
 

23269
07:42:45,920 --> 07:42:49,510
I've found is there will be a point in
calibration where I can use uh imagine

23270
07:42:49,510 --> 07:42:49,520
calibration where I can use uh imagine
 

23271
07:42:49,520 --> 07:42:52,350
calibration where I can use uh imagine
movement before that point it doesn't

23272
07:42:52,350 --> 07:42:52,360
movement before that point it doesn't
 

23273
07:42:52,360 --> 07:42:56,868
movement before that point it doesn't
really work so if I do calibration for

23274
07:42:56,868 --> 07:42:56,878
really work so if I do calibration for
 

23275
07:42:56,878 --> 07:43:00,070
really work so if I do calibration for
45 minutes the first

23276
07:43:00,070 --> 07:43:00,080
45 minutes the first
 

23277
07:43:00,080 --> 07:43:03,030
45 minutes the first
15 minutes I can't use imagine movement

23278
07:43:03,030 --> 07:43:03,040
15 minutes I can't use imagine movement
 

23279
07:43:03,040 --> 07:43:04,468
15 minutes I can't use imagine movement
it just like doesn't work for some

23280
07:43:04,468 --> 07:43:04,478
it just like doesn't work for some
 

23281
07:43:04,478 --> 07:43:09,788
it just like doesn't work for some
reason um and after a certain point uh I

23282
07:43:09,788 --> 07:43:09,798
reason um and after a certain point uh I
 

23283
07:43:09,798 --> 07:43:12,430
reason um and after a certain point uh I
I can just sort of feel it I can tell it

23284
07:43:12,430 --> 07:43:12,440
I can just sort of feel it I can tell it
 

23285
07:43:12,440 --> 07:43:15,190
I can just sort of feel it I can tell it
moves different uh that's the best way I

23286
07:43:15,190 --> 07:43:15,200
moves different uh that's the best way I
 

23287
07:43:15,200 --> 07:43:17,670
moves different uh that's the best way I
can I can describe it like it's almost

23288
07:43:17,670 --> 07:43:17,680
can I can describe it like it's almost
 

23289
07:43:17,680 --> 07:43:21,430
can I can describe it like it's almost
as if it is anticipating what I am going

23290
07:43:21,430 --> 07:43:21,440
as if it is anticipating what I am going
 

23291
07:43:21,440 --> 07:43:25,670
as if it is anticipating what I am going
to do again before I go to do it um and

23292
07:43:25,670 --> 07:43:25,680
to do again before I go to do it um and
 

23293
07:43:25,680 --> 07:43:28,750
to do again before I go to do it um and
so using attempted movement for 15

23294
07:43:28,750 --> 07:43:28,760
so using attempted movement for 15
 

23295
07:43:28,760 --> 07:43:31,788
so using attempted movement for 15
minutes at some point I can kind of tell

23296
07:43:31,788 --> 07:43:31,798
minutes at some point I can kind of tell
 

23297
07:43:31,798 --> 07:43:34,308
minutes at some point I can kind of tell
when I like move my eyes to the next

23298
07:43:34,308 --> 07:43:34,318
when I like move my eyes to the next
 

23299
07:43:34,318 --> 07:43:36,308
when I like move my eyes to the next
Target that the cursor is starting to

23300
07:43:36,308 --> 07:43:36,318
Target that the cursor is starting to
 

23301
07:43:36,318 --> 07:43:38,628
Target that the cursor is starting to
like pick up like it's starting to

23302
07:43:38,628 --> 07:43:38,638
like pick up like it's starting to
 

23303
07:43:38,638 --> 07:43:40,070
like pick up like it's starting to
understand it's learning like what I'm

23304
07:43:40,070 --> 07:43:40,080
understand it's learning like what I'm
 

23305
07:43:40,080 --> 07:43:42,030
understand it's learning like what I'm
going to do so first of all it's really

23306
07:43:42,030 --> 07:43:42,040
going to do so first of all it's really
 

23307
07:43:42,040 --> 07:43:44,230
going to do so first of all it's really
cool that I mean you are a true Pioneer

23308
07:43:44,230 --> 07:43:44,240
cool that I mean you are a true Pioneer
 

23309
07:43:44,240 --> 07:43:46,110
cool that I mean you are a true Pioneer
in all of this you're like

23310
07:43:46,110 --> 07:43:46,120
in all of this you're like
 

23311
07:43:46,120 --> 07:43:48,910
in all of this you're like
exploring how to do every aspect of this

23312
07:43:48,910 --> 07:43:48,920
exploring how to do every aspect of this
 

23313
07:43:48,920 --> 07:43:51,750
exploring how to do every aspect of this
most effectively and there's just uh I

23314
07:43:51,750 --> 07:43:51,760
most effectively and there's just uh I
 

23315
07:43:51,760 --> 07:43:53,548
most effectively and there's just uh I
imagine so many lessons learn from this

23316
07:43:53,548 --> 07:43:53,558
imagine so many lessons learn from this
 

23317
07:43:53,558 --> 07:43:55,670
imagine so many lessons learn from this
so thank you for being a Pioneer in all

23318
07:43:55,670 --> 07:43:55,680
so thank you for being a Pioneer in all
 

23319
07:43:55,680 --> 07:43:57,150
so thank you for being a Pioneer in all
these kinds of different like super

23320
07:43:57,150 --> 07:43:57,160
these kinds of different like super
 

23321
07:43:57,160 --> 07:43:59,230
these kinds of different like super
technical ways and it's also cool they

23322
07:43:59,230 --> 07:43:59,240
technical ways and it's also cool they
 

23323
07:43:59,240 --> 07:44:02,590
technical ways and it's also cool they
hear that there's like a different like

23324
07:44:02,590 --> 07:44:02,600
hear that there's like a different like
 

23325
07:44:02,600 --> 07:44:05,190
hear that there's like a different like
feeling to the experience when it's

23326
07:44:05,190 --> 07:44:05,200
feeling to the experience when it's
 

23327
07:44:05,200 --> 07:44:08,388
feeling to the experience when it's
calibrated in different ways like just

23328
07:44:08,388 --> 07:44:08,398
calibrated in different ways like just
 

23329
07:44:08,398 --> 07:44:10,670
calibrated in different ways like just
cuz I mean I imagine your brain is doing

23330
07:44:10,670 --> 07:44:10,680
cuz I mean I imagine your brain is doing
 

23331
07:44:10,680 --> 07:44:12,670
cuz I mean I imagine your brain is doing
something different and that's why

23332
07:44:12,670 --> 07:44:12,680
something different and that's why
 

23333
07:44:12,680 --> 07:44:14,350
something different and that's why
there's a different feeling to it and

23334
07:44:14,350 --> 07:44:14,360
there's a different feeling to it and
 

23335
07:44:14,360 --> 07:44:17,388
there's a different feeling to it and
then try and Define the words and the

23336
07:44:17,388 --> 07:44:17,398
then try and Define the words and the
 

23337
07:44:17,398 --> 07:44:19,110
then try and Define the words and the
measurements to those feelings would be

23338
07:44:19,110 --> 07:44:19,120
measurements to those feelings would be
 

23339
07:44:19,120 --> 07:44:20,430
measurements to those feelings would be
also interesting but at the end of the

23340
07:44:20,430 --> 07:44:20,440
also interesting but at the end of the
 

23341
07:44:20,440 --> 07:44:21,990
also interesting but at the end of the
day you can also measure that your

23342
07:44:21,990 --> 07:44:22,000
day you can also measure that your
 

23343
07:44:22,000 --> 07:44:24,590
day you can also measure that your
actual performance on whether it's snake

23344
07:44:24,590 --> 07:44:24,600
actual performance on whether it's snake
 

23345
07:44:24,600 --> 07:44:26,910
actual performance on whether it's snake
or web grid you can see like what

23346
07:44:26,910 --> 07:44:26,920
or web grid you can see like what
 

23347
07:44:26,920 --> 07:44:28,990
or web grid you can see like what
actually works well and you're saying

23348
07:44:28,990 --> 07:44:29,000
actually works well and you're saying
 

23349
07:44:29,000 --> 07:44:30,948
actually works well and you're saying
for the open loop

23350
07:44:30,948 --> 07:44:30,958
for the open loop
 

23351
07:44:30,958 --> 07:44:33,708
for the open loop
calibration the attempted movement works

23352
07:44:33,708 --> 07:44:33,718
calibration the attempted movement works
 

23353
07:44:33,718 --> 07:44:37,830
calibration the attempted movement works
best for now yep yep so the so the open

23354
07:44:37,830 --> 07:44:37,840
best for now yep yep so the so the open
 

23355
07:44:37,840 --> 07:44:39,548
best for now yep yep so the so the open
loop you don't get the feedback that's

23356
07:44:39,548 --> 07:44:39,558
loop you don't get the feedback that's
 

23357
07:44:39,558 --> 07:44:41,868
loop you don't get the feedback that's
something that you did something yeah

23358
07:44:41,868 --> 07:44:41,878
something that you did something yeah
 

23359
07:44:41,878 --> 07:44:44,628
something that you did something yeah
I'm is that frustrating no no it makes

23360
07:44:44,628 --> 07:44:44,638
I'm is that frustrating no no it makes
 

23361
07:44:44,638 --> 07:44:47,070
I'm is that frustrating no no it makes
sense to me like uh we've done it with a

23362
07:44:47,070 --> 07:44:47,080
sense to me like uh we've done it with a
 

23363
07:44:47,080 --> 07:44:49,110
sense to me like uh we've done it with a
cursor and without a cursor in open loop

23364
07:44:49,110 --> 07:44:49,120
cursor and without a cursor in open loop
 

23365
07:44:49,120 --> 07:44:52,510
cursor and without a cursor in open loop
so sometimes it's just um say for like

23366
07:44:52,510 --> 07:44:52,520
so sometimes it's just um say for like
 

23367
07:44:52,520 --> 07:44:56,270
so sometimes it's just um say for like
the center out the um you'll start

23368
07:44:56,270 --> 07:44:56,280
the center out the um you'll start
 

23369
07:44:56,280 --> 07:44:59,788
the center out the um you'll start
calibration with a bubble lighting up

23370
07:44:59,788 --> 07:44:59,798
calibration with a bubble lighting up
 

23371
07:44:59,798 --> 07:45:02,230
calibration with a bubble lighting up
and I push towards that bubble and then

23372
07:45:02,230 --> 07:45:02,240
and I push towards that bubble and then
 

23373
07:45:02,240 --> 07:45:04,548
and I push towards that bubble and then
when that bubble you know when it's

23374
07:45:04,548 --> 07:45:04,558
when that bubble you know when it's
 

23375
07:45:04,558 --> 07:45:06,548
when that bubble you know when it's
pushed towards that bubble for say 3

23376
07:45:06,548 --> 07:45:06,558
pushed towards that bubble for say 3
 

23377
07:45:06,558 --> 07:45:08,350
pushed towards that bubble for say 3
seconds the bubble will pop and then I

23378
07:45:08,350 --> 07:45:08,360
seconds the bubble will pop and then I
 

23379
07:45:08,360 --> 07:45:10,510
seconds the bubble will pop and then I
come back to the middle um so I'm doing

23380
07:45:10,510 --> 07:45:10,520
come back to the middle um so I'm doing
 

23381
07:45:10,520 --> 07:45:13,270
come back to the middle um so I'm doing
it all Ju Just by my intentions like

23382
07:45:13,270 --> 07:45:13,280
it all Ju Just by my intentions like
 

23383
07:45:13,280 --> 07:45:14,990
it all Ju Just by my intentions like
that's what it's learning anyway so it

23384
07:45:14,990 --> 07:45:15,000
that's what it's learning anyway so it
 

23385
07:45:15,000 --> 07:45:17,150
that's what it's learning anyway so it
makes sense that as long as I follow

23386
07:45:17,150 --> 07:45:17,160
makes sense that as long as I follow
 

23387
07:45:17,160 --> 07:45:18,468
makes sense that as long as I follow
what they want me to do you know like

23388
07:45:18,468 --> 07:45:18,478
what they want me to do you know like
 

23389
07:45:18,478 --> 07:45:20,230
what they want me to do you know like
Follow the yellow brick road that it'll

23390
07:45:20,230 --> 07:45:20,240
Follow the yellow brick road that it'll
 

23391
07:45:20,240 --> 07:45:23,350
Follow the yellow brick road that it'll
all work out um you're full of great

23392
07:45:23,350 --> 07:45:23,360
all work out um you're full of great
 

23393
07:45:23,360 --> 07:45:25,590
all work out um you're full of great
references uh is the is the bubble game

23394
07:45:25,590 --> 07:45:25,600
references uh is the is the bubble game
 

23395
07:45:25,600 --> 07:45:28,430
references uh is the is the bubble game
fun like yeah they always feel so bad

23396
07:45:28,430 --> 07:45:28,440
fun like yeah they always feel so bad
 

23397
07:45:28,440 --> 07:45:30,788
fun like yeah they always feel so bad
making me do calibration like oh we're

23398
07:45:30,788 --> 07:45:30,798
making me do calibration like oh we're
 

23399
07:45:30,798 --> 07:45:32,350
making me do calibration like oh we're
about to do you know a 40-minute

23400
07:45:32,350 --> 07:45:32,360
about to do you know a 40-minute
 

23401
07:45:32,360 --> 07:45:34,430
about to do you know a 40-minute
calibration I'm like all right do you

23402
07:45:34,430 --> 07:45:34,440
calibration I'm like all right do you
 

23403
07:45:34,440 --> 07:45:36,468
calibration I'm like all right do you
guys want to do two of them um like I'm

23404
07:45:36,468 --> 07:45:36,478
guys want to do two of them um like I'm
 

23405
07:45:36,478 --> 07:45:39,548
guys want to do two of them um like I'm
always asking to like whatever they need

23406
07:45:39,548 --> 07:45:39,558
always asking to like whatever they need
 

23407
07:45:39,558 --> 07:45:41,948
always asking to like whatever they need
I'm more than happy to do and it's not

23408
07:45:41,948 --> 07:45:41,958
I'm more than happy to do and it's not
 

23409
07:45:41,958 --> 07:45:45,150
I'm more than happy to do and it's not
it's not bad like I get to lie there and

23410
07:45:45,150 --> 07:45:45,160
it's not bad like I get to lie there and
 

23411
07:45:45,160 --> 07:45:48,150
it's not bad like I get to lie there and
um or sit in my chair and like do these

23412
07:45:48,150 --> 07:45:48,160
um or sit in my chair and like do these
 

23413
07:45:48,160 --> 07:45:51,030
um or sit in my chair and like do these
things with some great people I get to

23414
07:45:51,030 --> 07:45:51,040
things with some great people I get to
 

23415
07:45:51,040 --> 07:45:53,510
things with some great people I get to
have great conversations I can give them

23416
07:45:53,510 --> 07:45:53,520
have great conversations I can give them
 

23417
07:45:53,520 --> 07:45:56,350
have great conversations I can give them
feedback um I can talk about all sorts

23418
07:45:56,350 --> 07:45:56,360
feedback um I can talk about all sorts
 

23419
07:45:56,360 --> 07:45:58,590
feedback um I can talk about all sorts
of things uh I could throw something on

23420
07:45:58,590 --> 07:45:58,600
of things uh I could throw something on
 

23421
07:45:58,600 --> 07:46:00,830
of things uh I could throw something on
on my TV in the background and kind of

23422
07:46:00,830 --> 07:46:00,840
on my TV in the background and kind of
 

23423
07:46:00,840 --> 07:46:03,868
on my TV in the background and kind of
like split my attention between them um

23424
07:46:03,868 --> 07:46:03,878
like split my attention between them um
 

23425
07:46:03,878 --> 07:46:05,868
like split my attention between them um
like it's not bad at all I don't like is

23426
07:46:05,868 --> 07:46:05,878
like it's not bad at all I don't like is
 

23427
07:46:05,878 --> 07:46:07,708
like it's not bad at all I don't like is
there score that you get like can you do

23428
07:46:07,708 --> 07:46:07,718
there score that you get like can you do
 

23429
07:46:07,718 --> 07:46:09,308
there score that you get like can you do
better on the bubble game no I would

23430
07:46:09,308 --> 07:46:09,318
better on the bubble game no I would
 

23431
07:46:09,318 --> 07:46:13,708
better on the bubble game no I would
love that um I I I would love Yeah

23432
07:46:13,708 --> 07:46:13,718
love that um I I I would love Yeah
 

23433
07:46:13,718 --> 07:46:17,948
love that um I I I would love Yeah
writing down uh s suggests from noan

23434
07:46:17,948 --> 07:46:17,958
writing down uh s suggests from noan
 

23435
07:46:17,958 --> 07:46:20,990
writing down uh s suggests from noan
that's uh make it more fun gamified yeah

23436
07:46:20,990 --> 07:46:21,000
that's uh make it more fun gamified yeah
 

23437
07:46:21,000 --> 07:46:22,388
that's uh make it more fun gamified yeah
that's one thing that I really really

23438
07:46:22,388 --> 07:46:22,398
that's one thing that I really really
 

23439
07:46:22,398 --> 07:46:26,110
that's one thing that I really really
enjoy about web grid is because I'm so

23440
07:46:26,110 --> 07:46:26,120
enjoy about web grid is because I'm so
 

23441
07:46:26,120 --> 07:46:29,590
enjoy about web grid is because I'm so
competitive um like the higher the

23442
07:46:29,590 --> 07:46:29,600
competitive um like the higher the
 

23443
07:46:29,600 --> 07:46:32,230
competitive um like the higher the
BPS the higher the score I know the

23444
07:46:32,230 --> 07:46:32,240
BPS the higher the score I know the
 

23445
07:46:32,240 --> 07:46:34,830
BPS the higher the score I know the
better I'm doing and so if I I think

23446
07:46:34,830 --> 07:46:34,840
better I'm doing and so if I I think
 

23447
07:46:34,840 --> 07:46:37,230
better I'm doing and so if I I think
I've asked at one point one of the guys

23448
07:46:37,230 --> 07:46:37,240
I've asked at one point one of the guys
 

23449
07:46:37,240 --> 07:46:38,910
I've asked at one point one of the guys
like if he could give me some sort of

23450
07:46:38,910 --> 07:46:38,920
like if he could give me some sort of
 

23451
07:46:38,920 --> 07:46:41,110
like if he could give me some sort of
numerical feedback for calibration like

23452
07:46:41,110 --> 07:46:41,120
numerical feedback for calibration like
 

23453
07:46:41,120 --> 07:46:42,270
numerical feedback for calibration like
I would like to know what they're

23454
07:46:42,270 --> 07:46:42,280
I would like to know what they're
 

23455
07:46:42,280 --> 07:46:46,030
I would like to know what they're
looking at like oh you know it is um we

23456
07:46:46,030 --> 07:46:46,040
looking at like oh you know it is um we
 

23457
07:46:46,040 --> 07:46:48,190
looking at like oh you know it is um we
see like this number while you're doing

23458
07:46:48,190 --> 07:46:48,200
see like this number while you're doing
 

23459
07:46:48,200 --> 07:46:49,868
see like this number while you're doing
calibration and that means at least on

23460
07:46:49,868 --> 07:46:49,878
calibration and that means at least on
 

23461
07:46:49,878 --> 07:46:51,510
calibration and that means at least on
our end that we think calibration is

23462
07:46:51,510 --> 07:46:51,520
our end that we think calibration is
 

23463
07:46:51,520 --> 07:46:54,788
our end that we think calibration is
going well um and I would love that

23464
07:46:54,788 --> 07:46:54,798
going well um and I would love that
 

23465
07:46:54,798 --> 07:46:56,868
going well um and I would love that
because I would like to know if what I'm

23466
07:46:56,868 --> 07:46:56,878
because I would like to know if what I'm
 

23467
07:46:56,878 --> 07:46:58,308
because I would like to know if what I'm
doing is going well or not but then

23468
07:46:58,308 --> 07:46:58,318
doing is going well or not but then
 

23469
07:46:58,318 --> 07:47:00,230
doing is going well or not but then
theyve also told like yeah not

23470
07:47:00,230 --> 07:47:00,240
theyve also told like yeah not
 

23471
07:47:00,240 --> 07:47:02,150
theyve also told like yeah not
necessarily like one to one it doesn't

23472
07:47:02,150 --> 07:47:02,160
necessarily like one to one it doesn't
 

23473
07:47:02,160 --> 07:47:04,070
necessarily like one to one it doesn't
actually mean that calibration is going

23474
07:47:04,070 --> 07:47:04,080
actually mean that calibration is going
 

23475
07:47:04,080 --> 07:47:07,070
actually mean that calibration is going
well in some ways um so it's not like

23476
07:47:07,070 --> 07:47:07,080
well in some ways um so it's not like
 

23477
07:47:07,080 --> 07:47:09,270
well in some ways um so it's not like
100% And they don't want to like skew

23478
07:47:09,270 --> 07:47:09,280
100% And they don't want to like skew
 

23479
07:47:09,280 --> 07:47:11,590
100% And they don't want to like skew
what I'm experiencing or want me to

23480
07:47:11,590 --> 07:47:11,600
what I'm experiencing or want me to
 

23481
07:47:11,600 --> 07:47:13,308
what I'm experiencing or want me to
change things based on that if that

23482
07:47:13,308 --> 07:47:13,318
change things based on that if that
 

23483
07:47:13,318 --> 07:47:15,270
change things based on that if that
number isn't always accurate to like how

23484
07:47:15,270 --> 07:47:15,280
number isn't always accurate to like how
 

23485
07:47:15,280 --> 07:47:17,110
number isn't always accurate to like how
the model will turn out or how like the

23486
07:47:17,110 --> 07:47:17,120
the model will turn out or how like the
 

23487
07:47:17,120 --> 07:47:18,990
the model will turn out or how like the
end result that's at least what I got

23488
07:47:18,990 --> 07:47:19,000
end result that's at least what I got
 

23489
07:47:19,000 --> 07:47:21,830
end result that's at least what I got
from it uh one thing I do uh I have

23490
07:47:21,830 --> 07:47:21,840
from it uh one thing I do uh I have
 

23491
07:47:21,840 --> 07:47:23,830
from it uh one thing I do uh I have
asked them in something that I really

23492
07:47:23,830 --> 07:47:23,840
asked them in something that I really
 

23493
07:47:23,840 --> 07:47:27,110
asked them in something that I really
enjoy um striving for is towards the end

23494
07:47:27,110 --> 07:47:27,120
enjoy um striving for is towards the end
 

23495
07:47:27,120 --> 07:47:29,590
enjoy um striving for is towards the end
of calibration there is like a time

23496
07:47:29,590 --> 07:47:29,600
of calibration there is like a time
 

23497
07:47:29,600 --> 07:47:33,110
of calibration there is like a time
between targets um and so I like to keep

23498
07:47:33,110 --> 07:47:33,120
between targets um and so I like to keep
 

23499
07:47:33,120 --> 07:47:35,430
between targets um and so I like to keep
like at the end that number as low as

23500
07:47:35,430 --> 07:47:35,440
like at the end that number as low as
 

23501
07:47:35,440 --> 07:47:36,788
like at the end that number as low as
possible so at the beginning it can be

23502
07:47:36,788 --> 07:47:36,798
possible so at the beginning it can be
 

23503
07:47:36,798 --> 07:47:39,270
possible so at the beginning it can be
you know four five six seconds between

23504
07:47:39,270 --> 07:47:39,280
you know four five six seconds between
 

23505
07:47:39,280 --> 07:47:41,388
you know four five six seconds between
me popping bubbles but towards the end I

23506
07:47:41,388 --> 07:47:41,398
me popping bubbles but towards the end I
 

23507
07:47:41,398 --> 07:47:44,628
me popping bubbles but towards the end I
like to keep it below like 1.5 or if I

23508
07:47:44,628 --> 07:47:44,638
like to keep it below like 1.5 or if I
 

23509
07:47:44,638 --> 07:47:46,868
like to keep it below like 1.5 or if I
could get it to like one second between

23510
07:47:46,868 --> 07:47:46,878
could get it to like one second between
 

23511
07:47:46,878 --> 07:47:49,230
could get it to like one second between
like bubbles because in my mind that

23512
07:47:49,230 --> 07:47:49,240
like bubbles because in my mind that
 

23513
07:47:49,240 --> 07:47:51,430
like bubbles because in my mind that
translates um really nicely to something

23514
07:47:51,430 --> 07:47:51,440
translates um really nicely to something
 

23515
07:47:51,440 --> 07:47:53,510
translates um really nicely to something
like web grid where I know if I can hit

23516
07:47:53,510 --> 07:47:53,520
like web grid where I know if I can hit
 

23517
07:47:53,520 --> 07:47:57,110
like web grid where I know if I can hit
a Target uh one every second that I'm

23518
07:47:57,110 --> 07:47:57,120
a Target uh one every second that I'm
 

23519
07:47:57,120 --> 07:47:59,190
a Target uh one every second that I'm
doing real real well there you that's a

23520
07:47:59,190 --> 07:47:59,200
doing real real well there you that's a
 

23521
07:47:59,200 --> 07:48:00,750
doing real real well there you that's a
way to get a score on the calibrations

23522
07:48:00,750 --> 07:48:00,760
way to get a score on the calibrations
 

23523
07:48:00,760 --> 07:48:02,750
way to get a score on the calibrations
like the speed how quickly can you get

23524
07:48:02,750 --> 07:48:02,760
like the speed how quickly can you get
 

23525
07:48:02,760 --> 07:48:05,628
like the speed how quickly can you get
from Bubble to Bubble yeah uh so there's

23526
07:48:05,628 --> 07:48:05,638
from Bubble to Bubble yeah uh so there's
 

23527
07:48:05,638 --> 07:48:07,350
from Bubble to Bubble yeah uh so there's
the open loop and then it goes to the

23528
07:48:07,350 --> 07:48:07,360
the open loop and then it goes to the
 

23529
07:48:07,360 --> 07:48:10,110
the open loop and then it goes to the
closed loop the closed loop can already

23530
07:48:10,110 --> 07:48:10,120
closed loop the closed loop can already
 

23531
07:48:10,120 --> 07:48:11,708
closed loop the closed loop can already
start giving you a sense because you're

23532
07:48:11,708 --> 07:48:11,718
start giving you a sense because you're
 

23533
07:48:11,718 --> 07:48:13,150
start giving you a sense because you're
getting feedback of like how good the

23534
07:48:13,150 --> 07:48:13,160
getting feedback of like how good the
 

23535
07:48:13,160 --> 07:48:16,230
getting feedback of like how good the
model is yeah so closed loop is when I

23536
07:48:16,230 --> 07:48:16,240
model is yeah so closed loop is when I
 

23537
07:48:16,240 --> 07:48:19,270
model is yeah so closed loop is when I
um first get cursor control and how

23538
07:48:19,270 --> 07:48:19,280
um first get cursor control and how
 

23539
07:48:19,280 --> 07:48:21,548
um first get cursor control and how
they've uh described it to me someone

23540
07:48:21,548 --> 07:48:21,558
they've uh described it to me someone
 

23541
07:48:21,558 --> 07:48:23,990
they've uh described it to me someone
who does not understand this stuff I am

23542
07:48:23,990 --> 07:48:24,000
who does not understand this stuff I am
 

23543
07:48:24,000 --> 07:48:25,670
who does not understand this stuff I am
the dumbest person in the room every

23544
07:48:25,670 --> 07:48:25,680
the dumbest person in the room every
 

23545
07:48:25,680 --> 07:48:27,510
the dumbest person in the room every
time I'm with any of

23546
07:48:27,510 --> 07:48:27,520
time I'm with any of
 

23547
07:48:27,520 --> 07:48:30,388
time I'm with any of
humility um is that I am closing the

23548
07:48:30,388 --> 07:48:30,398
humility um is that I am closing the
 

23549
07:48:30,398 --> 07:48:33,910
humility um is that I am closing the
loop so I am actually now um the one

23550
07:48:33,910 --> 07:48:33,920
loop so I am actually now um the one
 

23551
07:48:33,920 --> 07:48:36,750
loop so I am actually now um the one
that is like finishing the loop of

23552
07:48:36,750 --> 07:48:36,760
that is like finishing the loop of
 

23553
07:48:36,760 --> 07:48:38,388
that is like finishing the loop of
whatever this Loop is I don't even know

23554
07:48:38,388 --> 07:48:38,398
whatever this Loop is I don't even know
 

23555
07:48:38,398 --> 07:48:40,030
whatever this Loop is I don't even know
what the loop is they've never told me

23556
07:48:40,030 --> 07:48:40,040
what the loop is they've never told me
 

23557
07:48:40,040 --> 07:48:42,350
what the loop is they've never told me
they just say there is a loop and at one

23558
07:48:42,350 --> 07:48:42,360
they just say there is a loop and at one
 

23559
07:48:42,360 --> 07:48:44,590
they just say there is a loop and at one
point it's open and I can't control and

23560
07:48:44,590 --> 07:48:44,600
point it's open and I can't control and
 

23561
07:48:44,600 --> 07:48:47,430
point it's open and I can't control and
then I get control and it's closed so

23562
07:48:47,430 --> 07:48:47,440
then I get control and it's closed so
 

23563
07:48:47,440 --> 07:48:49,750
then I get control and it's closed so
I'm finishing the loop so how long the

23564
07:48:49,750 --> 07:48:49,760
I'm finishing the loop so how long the
 

23565
07:48:49,760 --> 07:48:51,230
I'm finishing the loop so how long the
calibration usually take you said like

23566
07:48:51,230 --> 07:48:51,240
calibration usually take you said like
 

23567
07:48:51,240 --> 07:48:53,270
calibration usually take you said like
10 15 minutes well yeah they're they're

23568
07:48:53,270 --> 07:48:53,280
10 15 minutes well yeah they're they're
 

23569
07:48:53,280 --> 07:48:54,788
10 15 minutes well yeah they're they're
trying to get that number down pretty

23570
07:48:54,788 --> 07:48:54,798
trying to get that number down pretty
 

23571
07:48:54,798 --> 07:48:56,548
trying to get that number down pretty
low um that's what we've been working on

23572
07:48:56,548 --> 07:48:56,558
low um that's what we've been working on
 

23573
07:48:56,558 --> 07:48:58,948
low um that's what we've been working on
a lot recently is getting that down is

23574
07:48:58,948 --> 07:48:58,958
a lot recently is getting that down is
 

23575
07:48:58,958 --> 07:49:01,150
a lot recently is getting that down is
uh low as possible so that way you know

23576
07:49:01,150 --> 07:49:01,160
uh low as possible so that way you know
 

23577
07:49:01,160 --> 07:49:02,430
uh low as possible so that way you know
if this is something that people need to

23578
07:49:02,430 --> 07:49:02,440
if this is something that people need to
 

23579
07:49:02,440 --> 07:49:05,308
if this is something that people need to
do on a daily basis or if something

23580
07:49:05,308 --> 07:49:05,318
do on a daily basis or if something
 

23581
07:49:05,318 --> 07:49:08,948
do on a daily basis or if something
people need to do on a um like every

23582
07:49:08,948 --> 07:49:08,958
people need to do on a um like every
 

23583
07:49:08,958 --> 07:49:11,230
people need to do on a um like every
other day basis or once a week they

23584
07:49:11,230 --> 07:49:11,240
other day basis or once a week they
 

23585
07:49:11,240 --> 07:49:12,590
other day basis or once a week they
don't want people to be sitting in

23586
07:49:12,590 --> 07:49:12,600
don't want people to be sitting in
 

23587
07:49:12,600 --> 07:49:15,110
don't want people to be sitting in
calibration for long periods of time I

23588
07:49:15,110 --> 07:49:15,120
calibration for long periods of time I
 

23589
07:49:15,120 --> 07:49:17,308
calibration for long periods of time I
think they wanted to get it down s

23590
07:49:17,308 --> 07:49:17,318
think they wanted to get it down s
 

23591
07:49:17,318 --> 07:49:19,350
think they wanted to get it down s
minutes or below um at least where we're

23592
07:49:19,350 --> 07:49:19,360
minutes or below um at least where we're
 

23593
07:49:19,360 --> 07:49:21,788
minutes or below um at least where we're
at right now it'd be nice if they you

23594
07:49:21,788 --> 07:49:21,798
at right now it'd be nice if they you
 

23595
07:49:21,798 --> 07:49:24,510
at right now it'd be nice if they you
never had to do calibration um so we'll

23596
07:49:24,510 --> 07:49:24,520
never had to do calibration um so we'll
 

23597
07:49:24,520 --> 07:49:26,350
never had to do calibration um so we'll
get there at some point I'm sure the

23598
07:49:26,350 --> 07:49:26,360
get there at some point I'm sure the
 

23599
07:49:26,360 --> 07:49:29,150
get there at some point I'm sure the
more we learn about the brain and um

23600
07:49:29,150 --> 07:49:29,160
more we learn about the brain and um
 

23601
07:49:29,160 --> 07:49:31,388
more we learn about the brain and um
like I think that's you know the dream

23602
07:49:31,388 --> 07:49:31,398
like I think that's you know the dream
 

23603
07:49:31,398 --> 07:49:34,548
like I think that's you know the dream
um I think right now for me to get like

23604
07:49:34,548 --> 07:49:34,558
um I think right now for me to get like
 

23605
07:49:34,558 --> 07:49:37,230
um I think right now for me to get like
really really good models um I'm in

23606
07:49:37,230 --> 07:49:37,240
really really good models um I'm in
 

23607
07:49:37,240 --> 07:49:41,190
really really good models um I'm in
calibration 40 or 45 minutes um and I

23608
07:49:41,190 --> 07:49:41,200
calibration 40 or 45 minutes um and I
 

23609
07:49:41,200 --> 07:49:43,110
calibration 40 or 45 minutes um and I
don't mind like I said they always feel

23610
07:49:43,110 --> 07:49:43,120
don't mind like I said they always feel
 

23611
07:49:43,120 --> 07:49:45,110
don't mind like I said they always feel
really bad but if it's going to get me a

23612
07:49:45,110 --> 07:49:45,120
really bad but if it's going to get me a
 

23613
07:49:45,120 --> 07:49:47,030
really bad but if it's going to get me a
model that can like break these records

23614
07:49:47,030 --> 07:49:47,040
model that can like break these records
 

23615
07:49:47,040 --> 07:49:49,350
model that can like break these records
on web grid I'll stay in it for flipping

23616
07:49:49,350 --> 07:49:49,360
on web grid I'll stay in it for flipping
 

23617
07:49:49,360 --> 07:49:52,030
on web grid I'll stay in it for flipping
two hours let's talk business so web

23618
07:49:52,030 --> 07:49:52,040
two hours let's talk business so web
 

23619
07:49:52,040 --> 07:49:55,350
two hours let's talk business so web
grid um I saw a presentation that where

23620
07:49:55,350 --> 07:49:55,360
grid um I saw a presentation that where
 

23621
07:49:55,360 --> 07:49:58,350
grid um I saw a presentation that where
Bliss said by March you selected 89,000

23622
07:49:58,350 --> 07:49:58,360
Bliss said by March you selected 89,000
 

23623
07:49:58,360 --> 07:50:00,590
Bliss said by March you selected 89,000
Target gets a web grid can you explain

23624
07:50:00,590 --> 07:50:00,600
Target gets a web grid can you explain
 

23625
07:50:00,600 --> 07:50:03,510
Target gets a web grid can you explain
this game what what what is web grid and

23626
07:50:03,510 --> 07:50:03,520
this game what what what is web grid and
 

23627
07:50:03,520 --> 07:50:05,750
this game what what what is web grid and
what does it take to be a worldclass

23628
07:50:05,750 --> 07:50:05,760
what does it take to be a worldclass
 

23629
07:50:05,760 --> 07:50:08,190
what does it take to be a worldclass
performer and web grid as you continue

23630
07:50:08,190 --> 07:50:08,200
performer and web grid as you continue
 

23631
07:50:08,200 --> 07:50:12,750
performer and web grid as you continue
to break World Records yeah

23632
07:50:12,750 --> 07:50:12,760

like that template yeah so so um so web
grid is grid it it's it's literally just

23652
07:50:43,308 --> 07:50:43,318
grid is grid it it's it's literally just
 

23653
07:50:43,318 --> 07:50:46,788
grid is grid it it's it's literally just
a grid they can make it as big or small

23654
07:50:46,788 --> 07:50:46,798
a grid they can make it as big or small
 

23655
07:50:46,798 --> 07:50:49,548
a grid they can make it as big or small
as you can make a grid a single box on

23656
07:50:49,548 --> 07:50:49,558
as you can make a grid a single box on
 

23657
07:50:49,558 --> 07:50:50,990
as you can make a grid a single box on
that grid will light up and you go and

23658
07:50:50,990 --> 07:50:51,000
that grid will light up and you go and
 

23659
07:50:51,000 --> 07:50:53,708
that grid will light up and you go and
click it and it is a way for them to

23660
07:50:53,708 --> 07:50:53,718
click it and it is a way for them to
 

23661
07:50:53,718 --> 07:50:58,948
click it and it is a way for them to
Benchmark how good a BCI is so it's you

23662
07:50:58,948 --> 07:50:58,958
Benchmark how good a BCI is so it's you
 

23663
07:50:58,958 --> 07:51:00,510
Benchmark how good a BCI is so it's you
know pretty straightforward you just

23664
07:51:00,510 --> 07:51:00,520
know pretty straightforward you just
 

23665
07:51:00,520 --> 07:51:03,708
know pretty straightforward you just
click targets only one blue cell appears

23666
07:51:03,708 --> 07:51:03,718
click targets only one blue cell appears
 

23667
07:51:03,718 --> 07:51:05,308
click targets only one blue cell appears
and you're supposed to move the mouse to

23668
07:51:05,308 --> 07:51:05,318
and you're supposed to move the mouse to
 

23669
07:51:05,318 --> 07:51:07,388
and you're supposed to move the mouse to
there and click on it so I I like

23670
07:51:07,388 --> 07:51:07,398
there and click on it so I I like
 

23671
07:51:07,398 --> 07:51:11,270
there and click on it so I I like
playing on like bigger grids cuz it the

23672
07:51:11,270 --> 07:51:11,280
playing on like bigger grids cuz it the
 

23673
07:51:11,280 --> 07:51:15,070
playing on like bigger grids cuz it the
bigger the grid the like more BPS it's

23674
07:51:15,070 --> 07:51:15,080
bigger the grid the like more BPS it's
 

23675
07:51:15,080 --> 07:51:17,590
bigger the grid the like more BPS it's
bits per second um that you get every

23676
07:51:17,590 --> 07:51:17,600
bits per second um that you get every
 

23677
07:51:17,600 --> 07:51:19,910
bits per second um that you get every
time you click one so I'll say I'll play

23678
07:51:19,910 --> 07:51:19,920
time you click one so I'll say I'll play
 

23679
07:51:19,920 --> 07:51:24,110
time you click one so I'll say I'll play
on like a 35x 35 um grid and then one of

23680
07:51:24,110 --> 07:51:24,120
on like a 35x 35 um grid and then one of
 

23681
07:51:24,120 --> 07:51:27,548
on like a 35x 35 um grid and then one of
those little squares cell call it Target

23682
07:51:27,548 --> 07:51:27,558
those little squares cell call it Target
 

23683
07:51:27,558 --> 07:51:29,270
those little squares cell call it Target
whatever will light up and you move the

23684
07:51:29,270 --> 07:51:29,280
whatever will light up and you move the
 

23685
07:51:29,280 --> 07:51:31,510
whatever will light up and you move the
cursor there and you click it and then

23686
07:51:31,510 --> 07:51:31,520
cursor there and you click it and then
 

23687
07:51:31,520 --> 07:51:33,750
cursor there and you click it and then
you do that um

23688
07:51:33,750 --> 07:51:33,760
you do that um
 

23689
07:51:33,760 --> 07:51:36,270
you do that um
forever and you've been able to achieve

23690
07:51:36,270 --> 07:51:36,280
forever and you've been able to achieve
 

23691
07:51:36,280 --> 07:51:39,070
forever and you've been able to achieve
at first eight bits per second and You'

23692
07:51:39,070 --> 07:51:39,080
at first eight bits per second and You'
 

23693
07:51:39,080 --> 07:51:41,830
at first eight bits per second and You'
recently broke that yeah I'm I'm at 8.5

23694
07:51:41,830 --> 07:51:41,840
recently broke that yeah I'm I'm at 8.5
 

23695
07:51:41,840 --> 07:51:43,868
recently broke that yeah I'm I'm at 8.5
right now I would have beaten that

23696
07:51:43,868 --> 07:51:43,878
right now I would have beaten that
 

23697
07:51:43,878 --> 07:51:46,510
right now I would have beaten that
literally the day before I came to

23698
07:51:46,510 --> 07:51:46,520
literally the day before I came to
 

23699
07:51:46,520 --> 07:51:50,430
literally the day before I came to
Austin um but I had like a I don't know

23700
07:51:50,430 --> 07:51:50,440
Austin um but I had like a I don't know
 

23701
07:51:50,440 --> 07:51:53,990
Austin um but I had like a I don't know
like a 5-second lag right at the end and

23702
07:51:53,990 --> 07:51:54,000
like a 5-second lag right at the end and
 

23703
07:51:54,000 --> 07:51:56,308
like a 5-second lag right at the end and
um I just had to wait until the latency

23704
07:51:56,308 --> 07:51:56,318
um I just had to wait until the latency
 

23705
07:51:56,318 --> 07:51:59,350
um I just had to wait until the latency
calm down and then I kept clicking but

23706
07:51:59,350 --> 07:51:59,360
calm down and then I kept clicking but
 

23707
07:51:59,360 --> 07:52:01,110
calm down and then I kept clicking but
um I was at like

23708
07:52:01,110 --> 07:52:01,120
um I was at like
 

23709
07:52:01,120 --> 07:52:03,830
um I was at like
8.01 and then 5 Seconds of lag and then

23710
07:52:03,830 --> 07:52:03,840
8.01 and then 5 Seconds of lag and then
 

23711
07:52:03,840 --> 07:52:05,388
8.01 and then 5 Seconds of lag and then
the next like three targets I clicked

23712
07:52:05,388 --> 07:52:05,398
the next like three targets I clicked
 

23713
07:52:05,398 --> 07:52:08,230
the next like three targets I clicked
all stayed at 8.01 so if I would have

23714
07:52:08,230 --> 07:52:08,240
all stayed at 8.01 so if I would have
 

23715
07:52:08,240 --> 07:52:10,948
all stayed at 8.01 so if I would have
been able to click um during that time

23716
07:52:10,948 --> 07:52:10,958
been able to click um during that time
 

23717
07:52:10,958 --> 07:52:12,830
been able to click um during that time
of lag I probably would have hit I don't

23718
07:52:12,830 --> 07:52:12,840
of lag I probably would have hit I don't
 

23719
07:52:12,840 --> 07:52:15,190
of lag I probably would have hit I don't
know I might have hit nine so I'm there

23720
07:52:15,190 --> 07:52:15,200
know I might have hit nine so I'm there
 

23721
07:52:15,200 --> 07:52:17,070
know I might have hit nine so I'm there
I'm like I'm really close and then this

23722
07:52:17,070 --> 07:52:17,080
I'm like I'm really close and then this
 

23723
07:52:17,080 --> 07:52:19,308
I'm like I'm really close and then this
whole Austin trip has really gotten in

23724
07:52:19,308 --> 07:52:19,318
whole Austin trip has really gotten in
 

23725
07:52:19,318 --> 07:52:21,430
whole Austin trip has really gotten in
the way of my web grid playing ability

23726
07:52:21,430 --> 07:52:21,440
the way of my web grid playing ability
 

23727
07:52:21,440 --> 07:52:23,270
the way of my web grid playing ability
frustrating yeah so that's all you

23728
07:52:23,270 --> 07:52:23,280
frustrating yeah so that's all you
 

23729
07:52:23,280 --> 07:52:25,230
frustrating yeah so that's all you
thinking about right now yeah I know I

23730

thinking about right now yeah I know I
 

23731
07:52:25,240 --> 07:52:28,110
thinking about right now yeah I know I
just I just want I want to do better at

23732
07:52:28,110 --> 07:52:28,120
just I just want I want to do better at
 

23733
07:52:28,120 --> 07:52:29,868
just I just want I want to do better at
nine I want to do better I want to hit

23734

nine I think well I know nine is very

23736
07:52:32,468 --> 07:52:32,478
nine I think well I know nine is very
 

23737
07:52:32,478 --> 07:52:35,628
nine I think well I know nine is very
very achievable I'm right there um I

23738
07:52:35,628 --> 07:52:35,638
very achievable I'm right there um I
 

23739
07:52:35,638 --> 07:52:38,388
very achievable I'm right there um I
think 10 I could hit maybe in the next

23740
07:52:38,388 --> 07:52:38,398
think 10 I could hit maybe in the next
 

23741
07:52:38,398 --> 07:52:40,150
think 10 I could hit maybe in the next
month like I could do it probably in the

23742
07:52:40,150 --> 07:52:40,160
month like I could do it probably in the
 

23743
07:52:40,160 --> 07:52:42,030

everything you're doing there has impact
by striving to do well on web grid

23780
07:53:22,910 --> 07:53:22,920
by striving to do well on web grid
 

23781
07:53:22,920 --> 07:53:25,750
by striving to do well on web grid
you're helping everybody figure out how

23782
07:53:25,750 --> 07:53:25,760
you're helping everybody figure out how
 

23783
07:53:25,760 --> 07:53:27,590
you're helping everybody figure out how
to create the system all along like the

23784
07:53:27,590 --> 07:53:27,600
to create the system all along like the
 

23785
07:53:27,600 --> 07:53:30,548
to create the system all along like the
decoding the software the hardware the

23786
07:53:30,548 --> 07:53:30,558
decoding the software the hardware the
 

23787
07:53:30,558 --> 07:53:32,830
decoding the software the hardware the
calibration all of it how to make all of

23788
07:53:32,830 --> 07:53:32,840
calibration all of it how to make all of
 

23789
07:53:32,840 --> 07:53:34,948
calibration all of it how to make all of
that work so you can do everything else

23790
07:53:34,948 --> 07:53:34,958
that work so you can do everything else
 

23791
07:53:34,958 --> 07:53:37,868
that work so you can do everything else
really well yeah it's just really

23792
07:53:37,868 --> 07:53:37,878
really well yeah it's just really
 

23793
07:53:37,878 --> 07:53:40,150
really well yeah it's just really
fun well that's also that's part of the

23794
07:53:40,150 --> 07:53:40,160
fun well that's also that's part of the
 

23795
07:53:40,160 --> 07:53:43,150
fun well that's also that's part of the
thing is like making it fun yeah it's

23796
07:53:43,150 --> 07:53:43,160
thing is like making it fun yeah it's
 

23797
07:53:43,160 --> 07:53:47,308
thing is like making it fun yeah it's
addicting I'm I've joked about um like

23798
07:53:47,308 --> 07:53:47,318
addicting I'm I've joked about um like
 

23799
07:53:47,318 --> 07:53:49,070
addicting I'm I've joked about um like
what they actually did when they went in

23800
07:53:49,070 --> 07:53:49,080
what they actually did when they went in
 

23801
07:53:49,080 --> 07:53:50,708
what they actually did when they went in
and put this thing in my brain they must

23802
07:53:50,708 --> 07:53:50,718
and put this thing in my brain they must
 

23803
07:53:50,718 --> 07:53:53,910
and put this thing in my brain they must
have flipped a switch to make me uh more

23804
07:53:53,910 --> 07:53:53,920
have flipped a switch to make me uh more
 

23805
07:53:53,920 --> 07:53:55,670
have flipped a switch to make me uh more
susceptible to these kinds of games to

23806
07:53:55,670 --> 07:53:55,680
susceptible to these kinds of games to
 

23807
07:53:55,680 --> 07:53:58,070
susceptible to these kinds of games to
make me addicted to like web Grid or

23808
07:53:58,070 --> 07:53:58,080
make me addicted to like web Grid or
 

23809
07:53:58,080 --> 07:53:59,948
make me addicted to like web Grid or
something yeah do you know bliss's high

23810
07:53:59,948 --> 07:53:59,958
something yeah do you know bliss's high
 

23811
07:53:59,958 --> 07:54:02,150
something yeah do you know bliss's high
score yeah he said like 14 or something

23812
07:54:02,150 --> 07:54:02,160
score yeah he said like 14 or something
 

23813
07:54:02,160 --> 07:54:07,750
score yeah he said like 14 or something
17 oh boy 17.1 or something 177 a01 yeah

23814
07:54:07,750 --> 07:54:07,760
17 oh boy 17.1 or something 177 a01 yeah
 

23815

he told me he like does it on the floor

23816
07:54:09,830 --> 07:54:09,840
he told me he like does it on the floor
 

23817
07:54:09,840 --> 07:54:11,868

with peanut butter and he like fasts
it's it's it's weird it sounds like

23820
07:54:13,948 --> 07:54:13,958
it's it's it's weird it sounds like
 

23821
07:54:13,958 --> 07:54:15,548
it's it's it's weird it sounds like
cheating sounds like performance

23822
07:54:15,548 --> 07:54:15,558
cheating sounds like performance
 

23823
07:54:15,558 --> 07:54:17,990
cheating sounds like performance
enhancing uh noan like the first time

23824
07:54:17,990 --> 07:54:18,000
enhancing uh noan like the first time
 

23825
07:54:18,000 --> 07:54:19,868
enhancing uh noan like the first time
Nolan uh played this game he asked you

23826
07:54:19,868 --> 07:54:19,878
Nolan uh played this game he asked you
 

23827
07:54:19,878 --> 07:54:21,910
Nolan uh played this game he asked you
know how good are we at this game and I

23828
07:54:21,910 --> 07:54:21,920
know how good are we at this game and I
 

23829
07:54:21,920 --> 07:54:22,868
know how good are we at this game and I
think you told me right then you're

23830
07:54:22,868 --> 07:54:22,878
think you told me right then you're
 

23831
07:54:22,878 --> 07:54:24,150
think you told me right then you're
going to you're going to try to beat me

23832
07:54:24,150 --> 07:54:24,160
going to you're going to try to beat me
 

23833
07:54:24,160 --> 07:54:25,468
going to you're going to try to beat me
I'm going to get there someday I think I

23834
07:54:25,468 --> 07:54:25,478
I'm going to get there someday I think I
 

23835
07:54:25,478 --> 07:54:27,308
I'm going to get there someday I think I
I fully believe you I think I can I'm

23836
07:54:27,308 --> 07:54:27,318
I fully believe you I think I can I'm
 

23837
07:54:27,318 --> 07:54:28,910
I fully believe you I think I can I'm
excited for that yeah so I've been

23838
07:54:28,910 --> 07:54:28,920
excited for that yeah so I've been
 

23839
07:54:28,920 --> 07:54:32,830
excited for that yeah so I've been
playing first off with the dwell cursor

23840
07:54:32,830 --> 07:54:32,840
playing first off with the dwell cursor
 

23841
07:54:32,840 --> 07:54:35,830
playing first off with the dwell cursor
which really hampers my web grid playing

23842
07:54:35,830 --> 07:54:35,840
which really hampers my web grid playing
 

23843
07:54:35,840 --> 07:54:38,270
which really hampers my web grid playing
ability basically I have to wait3

23844
07:54:38,270 --> 07:54:38,280
ability basically I have to wait3
 

23845
07:54:38,280 --> 07:54:40,868
ability basically I have to wait3
seconds for every click oh so you can't

23846
07:54:40,868 --> 07:54:40,878
seconds for every click oh so you can't
 

23847
07:54:40,878 --> 07:54:42,750
seconds for every click oh so you can't
do the click so you have to you have to

23848
07:54:42,750 --> 07:54:42,760
do the click so you have to you have to
 

23849
07:54:42,760 --> 07:54:45,990
do the click so you have to you have to
so you click by dwelling you said three3

23850
07:54:45,990 --> 07:54:46,000
so you click by dwelling you said three3
 

23851
07:54:46,000 --> 07:54:50,070
so you click by dwelling you said three3
seconds which which sucks it really

23852
07:54:50,070 --> 07:54:50,080
seconds which which sucks it really
 

23853
07:54:50,080 --> 07:54:54,030
seconds which which sucks it really
slows down how much I'm able to like how

23854
07:54:54,030 --> 07:54:54,040
slows down how much I'm able to like how
 

23855
07:54:54,040 --> 07:54:57,190
slows down how much I'm able to like how
high I'm able to get I still hit like 50

23856
07:54:57,190 --> 07:54:57,200
high I'm able to get I still hit like 50
 

23857
07:54:57,200 --> 07:54:58,990
high I'm able to get I still hit like 50
I think I hit like 50

23858
07:54:58,990 --> 07:54:59,000
I think I hit like 50
 

23859
07:54:59,000 --> 07:55:00,910
I think I hit like 50
something trials net trials per minute

23860
07:55:00,910 --> 07:55:00,920
something trials net trials per minute
 

23861
07:55:00,920 --> 07:55:03,510
something trials net trials per minute
in that um which was pretty good um

23862
07:55:03,510 --> 07:55:03,520
in that um which was pretty good um
 

23863
07:55:03,520 --> 07:55:06,628
in that um which was pretty good um
because I'm able to like um there's one

23864
07:55:06,628 --> 07:55:06,638
because I'm able to like um there's one
 

23865
07:55:06,638 --> 07:55:09,190
because I'm able to like um there's one
of the settings is also like how slow

23866
07:55:09,190 --> 07:55:09,200
of the settings is also like how slow
 

23867
07:55:09,200 --> 07:55:11,430
of the settings is also like how slow
you need to be moving in order to

23868
07:55:11,430 --> 07:55:11,440
you need to be moving in order to
 

23869
07:55:11,440 --> 07:55:13,628
you need to be moving in order to
initiate a click to start a click so I

23870
07:55:13,628 --> 07:55:13,638
initiate a click to start a click so I
 

23871
07:55:13,638 --> 07:55:17,590
initiate a click to start a click so I
can tell sort of when I'm on that um

23872
07:55:17,590 --> 07:55:17,600
can tell sort of when I'm on that um
 

23873
07:55:17,600 --> 07:55:20,510
can tell sort of when I'm on that um
threshold to start initiating a click

23874
07:55:20,510 --> 07:55:20,520
threshold to start initiating a click
 

23875
07:55:20,520 --> 07:55:23,150
threshold to start initiating a click
just a bit early so I'm not fully

23876
07:55:23,150 --> 07:55:23,160
just a bit early so I'm not fully
 

23877
07:55:23,160 --> 07:55:24,948
just a bit early so I'm not fully
stopped over the Target when I go to

23878
07:55:24,948 --> 07:55:24,958
stopped over the Target when I go to
 

23879
07:55:24,958 --> 07:55:27,150
stopped over the Target when I go to
click I'm doing it like on my way to the

23880
07:55:27,150 --> 07:55:27,160
click I'm doing it like on my way to the
 

23881
07:55:27,160 --> 07:55:29,510
click I'm doing it like on my way to the
targets a little to try to time it just

23882
07:55:29,510 --> 07:55:29,520
targets a little to try to time it just
 

23883
07:55:29,520 --> 07:55:31,990
targets a little to try to time it just
right wow so you're slowing down yeah

23884
07:55:31,990 --> 07:55:32,000
right wow so you're slowing down yeah
 

23885
07:55:32,000 --> 07:55:34,628
right wow so you're slowing down yeah
just a just a hair right before the TS

23886
07:55:34,628 --> 07:55:34,638
just a just a hair right before the TS
 

23887
07:55:34,638 --> 07:55:37,590
just a just a hair right before the TS
this is like a lead performance okay but

23888
07:55:37,590 --> 07:55:37,600
this is like a lead performance okay but
 

23889
07:55:37,600 --> 07:55:39,830
this is like a lead performance okay but
that's still it's it sucks that there's

23890
07:55:39,830 --> 07:55:39,840
that's still it's it sucks that there's
 

23891
07:55:39,840 --> 07:55:42,430
that's still it's it sucks that there's
a ceiling of the three well there I can

23892
07:55:42,430 --> 07:55:42,440
a ceiling of the three well there I can
 

23893
07:55:42,440 --> 07:55:45,628
a ceiling of the three well there I can
get down to 0 2 and 0.1 Point one's what

23894
07:55:45,628 --> 07:55:45,638
get down to 0 2 and 0.1 Point one's what
 

23895
07:55:45,638 --> 07:55:47,030
get down to 0 2 and 0.1 Point one's what
yeah and I've played with that a little

23896
07:55:47,030 --> 07:55:47,040
yeah and I've played with that a little
 

23897
07:55:47,040 --> 07:55:49,468
yeah and I've played with that a little
bit too um I have to adjust a ton of

23898
07:55:49,468 --> 07:55:49,478
bit too um I have to adjust a ton of
 

23899
07:55:49,478 --> 07:55:51,190
bit too um I have to adjust a ton of
different parameters in order to play

23900
07:55:51,190 --> 07:55:51,200
different parameters in order to play
 

23901
07:55:51,200 --> 07:55:53,388
different parameters in order to play
with 0.1 and I don't have control over

23902
07:55:53,388 --> 07:55:53,398
with 0.1 and I don't have control over
 

23903
07:55:53,398 --> 07:55:56,308
with 0.1 and I don't have control over
all that on my end yet it also changes

23904
07:55:56,308 --> 07:55:56,318
all that on my end yet it also changes
 

23905
07:55:56,318 --> 07:55:58,590
all that on my end yet it also changes
like how the models are trained like if

23906
07:55:58,590 --> 07:55:58,600
like how the models are trained like if
 

23907
07:55:58,600 --> 07:56:00,830
like how the models are trained like if
I train a model like in web grid like a

23908
07:56:00,830 --> 07:56:00,840
I train a model like in web grid like a
 

23909
07:56:00,840 --> 07:56:02,468
I train a model like in web grid like a
bootstrap on a model which basically is

23910
07:56:02,468 --> 07:56:02,478
bootstrap on a model which basically is
 

23911
07:56:02,478 --> 07:56:04,708
bootstrap on a model which basically is
them uh training models as I'm playing

23912
07:56:04,708 --> 07:56:04,718
them uh training models as I'm playing
 

23913
07:56:04,718 --> 07:56:07,788
them uh training models as I'm playing
web grid um based off of like the web

23914
07:56:07,788 --> 07:56:07,798
web grid um based off of like the web
 

23915
07:56:07,798 --> 07:56:09,628
web grid um based off of like the web
grid data that I'm so like if I play web

23916
07:56:09,628 --> 07:56:09,638
grid data that I'm so like if I play web
 

23917
07:56:09,638 --> 07:56:12,070
grid data that I'm so like if I play web
grid for 10 minutes they can train off

23918
07:56:12,070 --> 07:56:12,080
grid for 10 minutes they can train off
 

23919
07:56:12,080 --> 07:56:14,190
grid for 10 minutes they can train off
that data specifically um in order to

23920
07:56:14,190 --> 07:56:14,200
that data specifically um in order to
 

23921
07:56:14,200 --> 07:56:16,788
that data specifically um in order to
get me a better model um if I do that

23922
07:56:16,788 --> 07:56:16,798
get me a better model um if I do that
 

23923
07:56:16,798 --> 07:56:19,830
get me a better model um if I do that
with. 3 versus 0.1 the models come out

23924
07:56:19,830 --> 07:56:19,840
with. 3 versus 0.1 the models come out
 

23925
07:56:19,840 --> 07:56:22,628
with. 3 versus 0.1 the models come out
different um the way that they um

23926
07:56:22,628 --> 07:56:22,638
different um the way that they um
 

23927
07:56:22,638 --> 07:56:25,110
different um the way that they um
interact it's just much much different

23928
07:56:25,110 --> 07:56:25,120
interact it's just much much different
 

23929
07:56:25,120 --> 07:56:26,830
interact it's just much much different
so I have to be really careful I found

23930
07:56:26,830 --> 07:56:26,840
so I have to be really careful I found
 

23931
07:56:26,840 --> 07:56:29,230
so I have to be really careful I found
that doing it with3 is actually better

23932
07:56:29,230 --> 07:56:29,240
that doing it with3 is actually better
 

23933
07:56:29,240 --> 07:56:31,830
that doing it with3 is actually better
in some ways unless I can do it with 01

23934
07:56:31,830 --> 07:56:31,840
in some ways unless I can do it with 01
 

23935
07:56:31,840 --> 07:56:33,110
in some ways unless I can do it with 01
and change all of the different

23936
07:56:33,110 --> 07:56:33,120
and change all of the different
 

23937
07:56:33,120 --> 07:56:35,548
and change all of the different
parameters then that's more ideal cuz

23938
07:56:35,548 --> 07:56:35,558
parameters then that's more ideal cuz
 

23939
07:56:35,558 --> 07:56:38,388
parameters then that's more ideal cuz
obviously point3 is faster than 0.1 so

23940
07:56:38,388 --> 07:56:38,398
obviously point3 is faster than 0.1 so
 

23941
07:56:38,398 --> 07:56:42,388
obviously point3 is faster than 0.1 so
uh I could I could get there I can get

23942
07:56:42,388 --> 07:56:42,398
uh I could I could get there I can get
 

23943
07:56:42,398 --> 07:56:46,070
uh I could I could get there I can get
there can you click using your brain for

23944
07:56:46,070 --> 07:56:46,080
there can you click using your brain for
 

23945
07:56:46,080 --> 07:56:47,788
there can you click using your brain for
right now it's the hover clicking with

23946
07:56:47,788 --> 07:56:47,798
right now it's the hover clicking with
 

23947
07:56:47,798 --> 07:56:50,788
right now it's the hover clicking with
the dwell cursor um we before all the

23948
07:56:50,788 --> 07:56:50,798
the dwell cursor um we before all the
 

23949
07:56:50,798 --> 07:56:52,750
the dwell cursor um we before all the
thread retraction stuff happened we were

23950
07:56:52,750 --> 07:56:52,760
thread retraction stuff happened we were
 

23951
07:56:52,760 --> 07:56:54,670
thread retraction stuff happened we were
calibrating clicks left click right

23952
07:56:54,670 --> 07:56:54,680
calibrating clicks left click right
 

23953
07:56:54,680 --> 07:56:58,190
calibrating clicks left click right
click that was um my previous ceiling um

23954
07:56:58,190 --> 07:56:58,200
click that was um my previous ceiling um
 

23955
07:56:58,200 --> 07:56:59,388
click that was um my previous ceiling um
before I broke the record again with the

23956
07:56:59,388 --> 07:56:59,398
before I broke the record again with the
 

23957
07:56:59,398 --> 07:57:03,270
before I broke the record again with the
dwell cursor was I think on a 35x 35

23958
07:57:03,270 --> 07:57:03,280
dwell cursor was I think on a 35x 35
 

23959
07:57:03,280 --> 07:57:05,468
dwell cursor was I think on a 35x 35
grid with left and right click and you

23960
07:57:05,468 --> 07:57:05,478
grid with left and right click and you
 

23961
07:57:05,478 --> 07:57:09,468
grid with left and right click and you
get more um BPS more bits per second

23962
07:57:09,468 --> 07:57:09,478
get more um BPS more bits per second
 

23963
07:57:09,478 --> 07:57:11,548
get more um BPS more bits per second
using multiple clicks because it's more

23964
07:57:11,548 --> 07:57:11,558
using multiple clicks because it's more
 

23965
07:57:11,558 --> 07:57:14,388
using multiple clicks because it's more
difficult oh because what is it the you

23966
07:57:14,388 --> 07:57:14,398
difficult oh because what is it the you
 

23967
07:57:14,398 --> 07:57:15,830
difficult oh because what is it the you
get you're supposed to do either a left

23968
07:57:15,830 --> 07:57:15,840
get you're supposed to do either a left
 

23969
07:57:15,840 --> 07:57:18,190
get you're supposed to do either a left
click or a like right click is it

23970
07:57:18,190 --> 07:57:18,200
click or a like right click is it
 

23971
07:57:18,200 --> 07:57:19,990
click or a like right click is it
different color like this yeah blue

23972
07:57:19,990 --> 07:57:20,000
different color like this yeah blue
 

23973
07:57:20,000 --> 07:57:21,910
different color like this yeah blue
targets for left click orange targets

23974
07:57:21,910 --> 07:57:21,920
targets for left click orange targets
 

23975
07:57:21,920 --> 07:57:23,830
targets for left click orange targets
for right click is what they had done so

23976
07:57:23,830 --> 07:57:23,840
for right click is what they had done so
 

23977
07:57:23,840 --> 07:57:26,150
for right click is what they had done so
uh my previous record of

23978
07:57:26,150 --> 07:57:26,160
uh my previous record of
 

23979
07:57:26,160 --> 07:57:28,910
uh my previous record of
7.5 with the blue and the orange targets

23980
07:57:28,910 --> 07:57:28,920
7.5 with the blue and the orange targets
 

23981
07:57:28,920 --> 07:57:32,070
7.5 with the blue and the orange targets
yeah which um I think if I went back to

23982
07:57:32,070 --> 07:57:32,080
yeah which um I think if I went back to
 

23983
07:57:32,080 --> 07:57:35,308
yeah which um I think if I went back to
that now um doing the click calibration

23984
07:57:35,308 --> 07:57:35,318
that now um doing the click calibration
 

23985
07:57:35,318 --> 07:57:36,868
that now um doing the click calibration
I would be able to and being able to

23986
07:57:36,868 --> 07:57:36,878
I would be able to and being able to
 

23987
07:57:36,878 --> 07:57:38,830
I would be able to and being able to
like initiate clicks on my own I think I

23988
07:57:38,830 --> 07:57:38,840
like initiate clicks on my own I think I
 

23989
07:57:38,840 --> 07:57:41,510
like initiate clicks on my own I think I
would break that 10 ceiling like in a

23990
07:57:41,510 --> 07:57:41,520
would break that 10 ceiling like in a
 

23991
07:57:41,520 --> 07:57:44,670
would break that 10 ceiling like in a
couple days max like yeah you'll start

23992
07:57:44,670 --> 07:57:44,680
couple days max like yeah you'll start
 

23993
07:57:44,680 --> 07:57:47,430
couple days max like yeah you'll start
making Bliss nervous about his 17 why do

23994
07:57:47,430 --> 07:57:47,440
making Bliss nervous about his 17 why do
 

23995
07:57:47,440 --> 07:57:50,990
making Bliss nervous about his 17 why do
you think we haven't given him the EXA

23996
07:57:50,990 --> 07:57:51,000
you think we haven't given him the EXA
 

23997
07:57:51,000 --> 07:57:53,468
you think we haven't given him the EXA
exactly uh so what would it feel like

23998
07:57:53,468 --> 07:57:53,478
exactly uh so what would it feel like
 

23999
07:57:53,478 --> 07:57:55,708
exactly uh so what would it feel like
with the retractions that there is uh

24000
07:57:55,708 --> 07:57:55,718
with the retractions that there is uh
 

24001
07:57:55,718 --> 07:57:57,510
with the retractions that there is uh
some of the threads retracted that

24002
07:57:57,510 --> 07:57:57,520
some of the threads retracted that
 

24003
07:57:57,520 --> 07:58:01,708
some of the threads retracted that
sucked it it was really really hard the

24004
07:58:01,708 --> 07:58:01,718
sucked it it was really really hard the
 

24005
07:58:01,718 --> 07:58:06,070
sucked it it was really really hard the
day they told me was the day of my big

24006
07:58:06,070 --> 07:58:06,080
day they told me was the day of my big
 

24007
07:58:06,080 --> 07:58:09,628
day they told me was the day of my big
neuralink tour at their Fremont facility

24008
07:58:09,628 --> 07:58:09,638
neuralink tour at their Fremont facility
 

24009
07:58:09,638 --> 07:58:11,230
neuralink tour at their Fremont facility
they told me like right before we went

24010
07:58:11,230 --> 07:58:11,240
they told me like right before we went
 

24011
07:58:11,240 --> 07:58:13,708
they told me like right before we went
over there it was really hard to hear my

24012
07:58:13,708 --> 07:58:13,718
over there it was really hard to hear my
 

24013
07:58:13,718 --> 07:58:16,430
over there it was really hard to hear my
initial reaction was all right go in fix

24014
07:58:16,430 --> 07:58:16,440
initial reaction was all right go in fix
 

24015
07:58:16,440 --> 07:58:18,510
initial reaction was all right go in fix
it like go in take it out and fix it the

24016
07:58:18,510 --> 07:58:18,520
it like go in take it out and fix it the
 

24017
07:58:18,520 --> 07:58:21,070
it like go in take it out and fix it the
first surgery was so easy like like I

24018
07:58:21,070 --> 07:58:21,080
first surgery was so easy like like I
 

24019
07:58:21,080 --> 07:58:22,628
first surgery was so easy like like I
went to sleep couple hours later I woke

24020
07:58:22,628 --> 07:58:22,638
went to sleep couple hours later I woke
 

24021
07:58:22,638 --> 07:58:25,948
went to sleep couple hours later I woke
up and here we are um I didn't feel any

24022
07:58:25,948 --> 07:58:25,958
up and here we are um I didn't feel any
 

24023
07:58:25,958 --> 07:58:28,670
up and here we are um I didn't feel any
pain didn't take like any um

24024
07:58:28,670 --> 07:58:28,680
pain didn't take like any um
 

24025
07:58:28,680 --> 07:58:31,628
pain didn't take like any um
um pain pills or anything so I just knew

24026
07:58:31,628 --> 07:58:31,638
um pain pills or anything so I just knew
 

24027
07:58:31,638 --> 07:58:34,270
um pain pills or anything so I just knew
that if they wanted to they could go in

24028
07:58:34,270 --> 07:58:34,280
that if they wanted to they could go in
 

24029
07:58:34,280 --> 07:58:37,230
that if they wanted to they could go in
and put in a new one like next day if

24030
07:58:37,230 --> 07:58:37,240
and put in a new one like next day if
 

24031
07:58:37,240 --> 07:58:39,750
and put in a new one like next day if
that's what it took cuz I just wanted I

24032
07:58:39,750 --> 07:58:39,760
that's what it took cuz I just wanted I
 

24033
07:58:39,760 --> 07:58:42,990
that's what it took cuz I just wanted I
wanted it to be better and I wanted not

24034
07:58:42,990 --> 07:58:43,000
wanted it to be better and I wanted not
 

24035
07:58:43,000 --> 07:58:48,150
wanted it to be better and I wanted not
to lose the capability I had so much fun

24036
07:58:48,150 --> 07:58:48,160
to lose the capability I had so much fun
 

24037
07:58:48,160 --> 07:58:50,590
to lose the capability I had so much fun
um playing with it for a few weeks for a

24038
07:58:50,590 --> 07:58:50,600
um playing with it for a few weeks for a
 

24039
07:58:50,600 --> 07:58:53,430
um playing with it for a few weeks for a
month I had like it had opened up so

24040
07:58:53,430 --> 07:58:53,440
month I had like it had opened up so
 

24041
07:58:53,440 --> 07:58:55,070
month I had like it had opened up so
many doors for me it had opened up so

24042
07:58:55,070 --> 07:58:55,080
many doors for me it had opened up so
 

24043
07:58:55,080 --> 07:58:56,910
many doors for me it had opened up so
many more possibilities that I didn't

24044
07:58:56,910 --> 07:58:56,920
many more possibilities that I didn't
 

24045
07:58:56,920 --> 07:58:58,990
many more possibilities that I didn't
want to lose it after mon I thought it

24046
07:58:58,990 --> 07:58:59,000
want to lose it after mon I thought it
 

24047
07:58:59,000 --> 07:59:02,590
want to lose it after mon I thought it
would have been a cruel twist of fate if

24048
07:59:02,590 --> 07:59:02,600
would have been a cruel twist of fate if
 

24049
07:59:02,600 --> 07:59:04,750
would have been a cruel twist of fate if
I had gotten to

24050
07:59:04,750 --> 07:59:04,760
I had gotten to
 

24051
07:59:04,760 --> 07:59:07,430
I had gotten to
see the view from like the top of this

24052
07:59:07,430 --> 07:59:07,440
see the view from like the top of this
 

24053
07:59:07,440 --> 07:59:09,510
see the view from like the top of this
mountain and then have it all come

24054
07:59:09,510 --> 07:59:09,520
mountain and then have it all come
 

24055
07:59:09,520 --> 07:59:11,590
mountain and then have it all come
crashing down after a month and I knew

24056
07:59:11,590 --> 07:59:11,600
crashing down after a month and I knew
 

24057
07:59:11,600 --> 07:59:14,548
crashing down after a month and I knew
like say the top of the mountain but uh

24058
07:59:14,548 --> 07:59:14,558
like say the top of the mountain but uh
 

24059
07:59:14,558 --> 07:59:18,070
like say the top of the mountain but uh
like I how I saw it was I was just now

24060
07:59:18,070 --> 07:59:18,080
like I how I saw it was I was just now
 

24061
07:59:18,080 --> 07:59:21,030
like I how I saw it was I was just now
starting to climb the mountain and I was

24062
07:59:21,030 --> 07:59:21,040
starting to climb the mountain and I was
 

24063
07:59:21,040 --> 07:59:22,430
starting to climb the mountain and I was
it like there was so much more that I

24064
07:59:22,430 --> 07:59:22,440
it like there was so much more that I
 

24065
07:59:22,440 --> 07:59:24,948
it like there was so much more that I
knew was possible and so to have all of

24066
07:59:24,948 --> 07:59:24,958
knew was possible and so to have all of
 

24067
07:59:24,958 --> 07:59:26,430
knew was possible and so to have all of
that be taken away was really really

24068
07:59:26,430 --> 07:59:26,440
that be taken away was really really
 

24069
07:59:26,440 --> 07:59:29,150
that be taken away was really really
hard um

24070
07:59:29,150 --> 07:59:29,160
hard um
 

24071
07:59:29,160 --> 07:59:31,948
hard um
but then on the drive over to the

24072
07:59:31,948 --> 07:59:31,958
but then on the drive over to the
 

24073
07:59:31,958 --> 07:59:34,030

been privileged to experience and then
for a few days uh I was pretty down in

24104
08:00:13,030 --> 08:00:13,040
for a few days uh I was pretty down in
 

24105
08:00:13,040 --> 08:00:16,230
for a few days uh I was pretty down in
the dumps but uh for like the first few

08:00:28,030 --> 08:00:28,040
it
 

24115
08:00:28,040 --> 08:00:31,150
it
even if I lost the ability to use the

24116
08:00:31,150 --> 08:00:31,160
even if I lost the ability to use the
 

24117
08:00:31,160 --> 08:00:34,628
even if I lost the ability to use the
neuralink even if I lost um even if I

24118
08:00:34,628 --> 08:00:34,638
neuralink even if I lost um even if I
 

24119
08:00:34,638 --> 08:00:37,270
neuralink even if I lost um even if I
like lost out on everything to come um

24120
08:00:37,270 --> 08:00:37,280
like lost out on everything to come um
 

24121
08:00:37,280 --> 08:00:39,708
like lost out on everything to come um
if I could keep giving them data in any

24122
08:00:39,708 --> 08:00:39,718
if I could keep giving them data in any
 

24123
08:00:39,718 --> 08:00:42,230
if I could keep giving them data in any
way then I would do that if I needed to

24124
08:00:42,230 --> 08:00:42,240
way then I would do that if I needed to
 

24125
08:00:42,240 --> 08:00:44,670
way then I would do that if I needed to
just do um like some the data collection

24126
08:00:44,670 --> 08:00:44,680
just do um like some the data collection
 

24127
08:00:44,680 --> 08:00:46,510
just do um like some the data collection
every day or body mapping every day for

24128
08:00:46,510 --> 08:00:46,520
every day or body mapping every day for
 

24129
08:00:46,520 --> 08:00:49,708
every day or body mapping every day for
a year then I would do it um because I

24130
08:00:49,708 --> 08:00:49,718
a year then I would do it um because I
 

24131
08:00:49,718 --> 08:00:53,548
a year then I would do it um because I
know that everything I'm doing helps

24132
08:00:53,548 --> 08:00:53,558
know that everything I'm doing helps
 

24133
08:00:53,558 --> 08:00:55,750
know that everything I'm doing helps
everyone to come after me and that's all

24134
08:00:55,750 --> 08:00:55,760
everyone to come after me and that's all
 

24135
08:00:55,760 --> 08:00:57,708
everyone to come after me and that's all
I wanted I guess the whole reason that I

24136
08:00:57,708 --> 08:00:57,718
I wanted I guess the whole reason that I
 

24137
08:00:57,718 --> 08:01:00,230
I wanted I guess the whole reason that I
did did this was to help people and I

did did this was to help people and I
 

24139
08:01:00,240 --> 08:01:02,190
did did this was to help people and I
knew that anything I could do to help I

24140
08:01:02,190 --> 08:01:02,200
knew that anything I could do to help I
 

24141
08:01:02,200 --> 08:01:04,628
knew that anything I could do to help I
would continue to do even if I never got

24142
08:01:04,628 --> 08:01:04,638
would continue to do even if I never got
 

24143
08:01:04,638 --> 08:01:07,548
would continue to do even if I never got
to use the cursor again then you know I

24144
08:01:07,548 --> 08:01:07,558
to use the cursor again then you know I
 

24145
08:01:07,558 --> 08:01:10,308
to use the cursor again then you know I
was just happy to be a part of it and

24146
08:01:10,308 --> 08:01:10,318
was just happy to be a part of it and
 

24147
08:01:10,318 --> 08:01:12,190
was just happy to be a part of it and
everything that I had done was just a

24148
08:01:12,190 --> 08:01:12,200
everything that I had done was just a
 

24149
08:01:12,200 --> 08:01:13,750
everything that I had done was just a
perk it was something that I got to

24150
08:01:13,750 --> 08:01:13,760
perk it was something that I got to
 

24151
08:01:13,760 --> 08:01:15,468
perk it was something that I got to
experience and I know how amazing it's

going to be for everyone to come after
 

24155
08:01:16,680 --> 08:01:18,910
going to be for everyone to come after
me so might as well just

24156
08:01:18,910 --> 08:01:18,920
me so might as well just
 

24157
08:01:18,920 --> 08:01:22,468
me so might as well just
keep trucking along you know well that

24158
08:01:22,468 --> 08:01:22,478
keep trucking along you know well that
 

24159

keep trucking along you know well that
said you were able to get to work your

24160
08:01:25,350 --> 08:01:25,360
said you were able to get to work your
 

24161
08:01:25,360 --> 08:01:27,468
said you were able to get to work your
way up to get the performance back so

way up to get the performance back so
 

24163
08:01:27,478 --> 08:01:29,230
way up to get the performance back so
this is like going from Rocky one to

24164
08:01:29,230 --> 08:01:29,240
this is like going from Rocky one to
 

24165
08:01:29,240 --> 08:01:31,590
this is like going from Rocky one to
Rocky two so when did you first

24166
08:01:31,590 --> 08:01:31,600
Rocky two so when did you first
 

24167
08:01:31,600 --> 08:01:34,510
Rocky two so when did you first
realize that this is possible and what

24168
08:01:34,510 --> 08:01:34,520
realize that this is possible and what
 

24169
08:01:34,520 --> 08:01:35,990
realize that this is possible and what
gave you sort of the strength the

24170
08:01:35,990 --> 08:01:36,000
gave you sort of the strength the
 

24171
08:01:36,000 --> 08:01:38,990
gave you sort of the strength the
motivation DET determination to do it to

24172
08:01:38,990 --> 08:01:39,000
motivation DET determination to do it to
 

24173

24181
08:01:46,558 --> 08:01:49,628
interviewing an
athlete this is great I like to thing my

24182
08:01:49,628 --> 08:01:49,638
athlete this is great I like to thing my
 

24183
08:01:49,638 --> 08:01:51,868
athlete this is great I like to thing my
parents uh the road the road back was

24184
08:01:51,868 --> 08:01:51,878
parents uh the road the road back was
 

24185
08:01:51,878 --> 08:01:55,110
parents uh the road the road back was
long and hard prob many difficulties

24186
08:01:55,110 --> 08:01:55,120
long and hard prob many difficulties
 

24187
08:01:55,120 --> 08:01:56,628
long and hard prob many difficulties
there were Dark

24188
08:01:56,628 --> 08:01:56,638
there were Dark
 

24189
08:01:56,638 --> 08:01:59,388
there were Dark
Days uh

24190
08:01:59,388 --> 08:01:59,398
Days uh
 

24191
08:01:59,398 --> 08:02:01,830
Days uh
uh it was it was a couple weeks uh I

24192
08:02:01,830 --> 08:02:01,840
uh it was it was a couple weeks uh I
 

24193
08:02:01,840 --> 08:02:03,990
uh it was it was a couple weeks uh I
think and then there was just a turning

24194
08:02:03,990 --> 08:02:04,000
think and then there was just a turning
 

24195
08:02:04,000 --> 08:02:07,990
think and then there was just a turning
point I think they had switched how um

24196
08:02:07,990 --> 08:02:08,000
point I think they had switched how um
 

24197
08:02:08,000 --> 08:02:11,150
point I think they had switched how um
they were measuring um the neuron spikes

24198
08:02:11,150 --> 08:02:11,160
they were measuring um the neuron spikes
 

24199
08:02:11,160 --> 08:02:14,270
they were measuring um the neuron spikes
in my brain like the Bliss help me out

24200
08:02:14,270 --> 08:02:14,280
in my brain like the Bliss help me out
 

24201
08:02:14,280 --> 08:02:15,868
in my brain like the Bliss help me out
uh yeah the way in which we were

24202
08:02:15,868 --> 08:02:15,878
uh yeah the way in which we were
 

24203
08:02:15,878 --> 08:02:17,628
uh yeah the way in which we were
measuring uh the behavior of individual

24204
08:02:17,628 --> 08:02:17,638
measuring uh the behavior of individual
 

24205
08:02:17,638 --> 08:02:19,830
measuring uh the behavior of individual
neurons yeah so we're switching from uh

24206
08:02:19,830 --> 08:02:19,840
neurons yeah so we're switching from uh
 

24207
08:02:19,840 --> 08:02:21,510
neurons yeah so we're switching from uh
sort of individual Spike detection to

24208
08:02:21,510 --> 08:02:21,520
sort of individual Spike detection to
 

24209
08:02:21,520 --> 08:02:23,230
sort of individual Spike detection to
something called Spike band power which

24210
08:02:23,230 --> 08:02:23,240
something called Spike band power which
 

24211
08:02:23,240 --> 08:02:24,708
something called Spike band power which
uh if you watch the previous segments

24212
08:02:24,708 --> 08:02:24,718
uh if you watch the previous segments
 

24213
08:02:24,718 --> 08:02:25,948
uh if you watch the previous segments
with either me or DJ you probably have

24214
08:02:25,948 --> 08:02:25,958
with either me or DJ you probably have
 

24215
08:02:25,958 --> 08:02:28,070
with either me or DJ you probably have
some content yeah okay so when when they

24216
08:02:28,070 --> 08:02:28,080
some content yeah okay so when when they
 

24217
08:02:28,080 --> 08:02:31,070
some content yeah okay so when when they
did that it was kind of like uh you know

24218
08:02:31,070 --> 08:02:31,080
did that it was kind of like uh you know
 

24219
08:02:31,080 --> 08:02:32,628
did that it was kind of like uh you know
light over the head like light bulb

24220
08:02:32,628 --> 08:02:32,638
light over the head like light bulb
 

24221
08:02:32,638 --> 08:02:36,910
light over the head like light bulb
moment like oh this works and um this

24222
08:02:36,910 --> 08:02:36,920
moment like oh this works and um this
 

24223
08:02:36,920 --> 08:02:39,350
moment like oh this works and um this
seems like like we can run with this and

24224
08:02:39,350 --> 08:02:39,360
seems like like we can run with this and
 

24225
08:02:39,360 --> 08:02:43,190
seems like like we can run with this and
I saw the um uptick performance

24226
08:02:43,190 --> 08:02:43,200
I saw the um uptick performance
 

24227
08:02:43,200 --> 08:02:45,150
I saw the um uptick performance
immediately like I could feel it when

24228
08:02:45,150 --> 08:02:45,160
immediately like I could feel it when
 

24229
08:02:45,160 --> 08:02:46,468
immediately like I could feel it when
they switched over I was like this is

24230
08:02:46,468 --> 08:02:46,478
they switched over I was like this is
 

24231
08:02:46,478 --> 08:02:49,270
they switched over I was like this is
better like this is good like everything

24232
08:02:49,270 --> 08:02:49,280
better like this is good like everything
 

24233
08:02:49,280 --> 08:02:50,628
better like this is good like everything
up till this point for the last few

24234
08:02:50,628 --> 08:02:50,638
up till this point for the last few
 

24235
08:02:50,638 --> 08:02:52,708
up till this point for the last few
weeks last like whatever three or four

24236
08:02:52,708 --> 08:02:52,718
weeks last like whatever three or four
 

24237
08:02:52,718 --> 08:02:54,270
weeks last like whatever three or four
weeks cuz it was before they even told

24238
08:02:54,270 --> 08:02:54,280
weeks cuz it was before they even told
 

24239
08:02:54,280 --> 08:02:56,830
weeks cuz it was before they even told
me like everything before this sucked

24240
08:02:56,830 --> 08:02:56,840
me like everything before this sucked
 

24241
08:02:56,840 --> 08:02:58,350
me like everything before this sucked
like let's keep doing what we're doing

24242
08:02:58,350 --> 08:02:58,360
like let's keep doing what we're doing
 

24243
08:02:58,360 --> 08:03:02,030
like let's keep doing what we're doing
now and at that point it was not like oh

24244
08:03:02,030 --> 08:03:02,040
now and at that point it was not like oh
 

24245
08:03:02,040 --> 08:03:05,070
now and at that point it was not like oh
I know I'm still only at like say in web

24246
08:03:05,070 --> 08:03:05,080
I know I'm still only at like say in web
 

24247
08:03:05,080 --> 08:03:07,070
I know I'm still only at like say in web
grid terms like four or five BPS

24248
08:03:07,070 --> 08:03:07,080
grid terms like four or five BPS
 

24249
08:03:07,080 --> 08:03:10,510
grid terms like four or five BPS
compared to my 7.5 before but I know

24250
08:03:10,510 --> 08:03:10,520
compared to my 7.5 before but I know
 

24251
08:03:10,520 --> 08:03:13,670
compared to my 7.5 before but I know
that if we keep doing this then like I

24252
08:03:13,670 --> 08:03:13,680
that if we keep doing this then like I
 

24253
08:03:13,680 --> 08:03:16,270
that if we keep doing this then like I
can I can get back there and then they

24254
08:03:16,270 --> 08:03:16,280
can I can get back there and then they
 

24255
08:03:16,280 --> 08:03:18,590
can I can get back there and then they
gave me the dwell cursor and the dwell

24256
08:03:18,590 --> 08:03:18,600
gave me the dwell cursor and the dwell
 

24257
08:03:18,600 --> 08:03:20,430
gave me the dwell cursor and the dwell
cursor sucked at first it's not

24258
08:03:20,430 --> 08:03:20,440
cursor sucked at first it's not
 

24259
08:03:20,440 --> 08:03:24,910
cursor sucked at first it's not
obviously not what I want but it gave me

24260
08:03:24,910 --> 08:03:24,920
obviously not what I want but it gave me
 

24261
08:03:24,920 --> 08:03:26,948
obviously not what I want but it gave me
a path forward to be able to continue

24262
08:03:26,948 --> 08:03:26,958
a path forward to be able to continue
 

24263
08:03:26,958 --> 08:03:30,030
a path forward to be able to continue
using it and um hopefully to continue to

24264
08:03:30,030 --> 08:03:30,040
using it and um hopefully to continue to
 

24265
08:03:30,040 --> 08:03:33,270
using it and um hopefully to continue to
help out and so I just ran with it never

24266
08:03:33,270 --> 08:03:33,280
help out and so I just ran with it never
 

24267
08:03:33,280 --> 08:03:35,548
help out and so I just ran with it never
looked back like I said I just kind of

24268
08:03:35,548 --> 08:03:35,558
looked back like I said I just kind of
 

24269
08:03:35,558 --> 08:03:37,030
looked back like I said I just kind of
person I roll with the punches anyways

24270
08:03:37,030 --> 08:03:37,040
person I roll with the punches anyways
 

24271
08:03:37,040 --> 08:03:39,990
person I roll with the punches anyways
so what was the process what was the

24272
08:03:39,990 --> 08:03:40,000
so what was the process what was the
 

24273
08:03:40,000 --> 08:03:41,910
so what was the process what was the
feedback loop on the figuring out how to

24274
08:03:41,910 --> 08:03:41,920
feedback loop on the figuring out how to
 

24275
08:03:41,920 --> 08:03:43,230
feedback loop on the figuring out how to
do the spike detection in a way that

24276
08:03:43,230 --> 08:03:43,240
do the spike detection in a way that
 

24277
08:03:43,240 --> 08:03:45,190
do the spike detection in a way that
would actually work well for Noah yeah

24278
08:03:45,190 --> 08:03:45,200
would actually work well for Noah yeah
 

24279
08:03:45,200 --> 08:03:46,590
would actually work well for Noah yeah
it's a great question so maybe just to

24280
08:03:46,590 --> 08:03:46,600
it's a great question so maybe just to
 

24281
08:03:46,600 --> 08:03:49,070
it's a great question so maybe just to
describe first how the actual update

24282
08:03:49,070 --> 08:03:49,080
describe first how the actual update
 

24283
08:03:49,080 --> 08:03:50,270
describe first how the actual update
worked it basically an update to your

24284
08:03:50,270 --> 08:03:50,280
worked it basically an update to your
 

24285
08:03:50,280 --> 08:03:52,030
worked it basically an update to your
implant so we just did an over the a

24286
08:03:52,030 --> 08:03:52,040
implant so we just did an over the a
 

24287
08:03:52,040 --> 08:03:53,830
implant so we just did an over the a
software update to his implant and way

24288
08:03:53,830 --> 08:03:53,840
software update to his implant and way
 

24289
08:03:53,840 --> 08:03:56,070
software update to his implant and way
you'd update your Tesla or your iPhone

24290
08:03:56,070 --> 08:03:56,080
you'd update your Tesla or your iPhone
 

24291
08:03:56,080 --> 08:03:58,708
you'd update your Tesla or your iPhone
and uh that firmware change enabl us to

24292
08:03:58,708 --> 08:03:58,718
and uh that firmware change enabl us to
 

24293
08:03:58,718 --> 08:04:01,030
and uh that firmware change enabl us to
record sort of averages of populations

24294
08:04:01,030 --> 08:04:01,040
record sort of averages of populations
 

24295
08:04:01,040 --> 08:04:02,628
record sort of averages of populations
of neurons nearby individual electrodes

24296
08:04:02,628 --> 08:04:02,638
of neurons nearby individual electrodes
 

24297
08:04:02,638 --> 08:04:04,990
of neurons nearby individual electrodes
so we have uh of less resolution about

24298
08:04:04,990 --> 08:04:05,000
so we have uh of less resolution about
 

24299
08:04:05,000 --> 08:04:06,708
so we have uh of less resolution about
which individual neuron is doing what

24300
08:04:06,708 --> 08:04:06,718
which individual neuron is doing what
 

24301
08:04:06,718 --> 08:04:08,110
which individual neuron is doing what
but we have a broader picture of what's

24302
08:04:08,110 --> 08:04:08,120
but we have a broader picture of what's
 

24303
08:04:08,120 --> 08:04:10,948
but we have a broader picture of what's
going on nearby an electrode overall and

24304
08:04:10,948 --> 08:04:10,958
going on nearby an electrode overall and
 

24305
08:04:10,958 --> 08:04:12,910
going on nearby an electrode overall and
uh that feedback I mean basically as no

24306
08:04:12,910 --> 08:04:12,920
uh that feedback I mean basically as no
 

24307
08:04:12,920 --> 08:04:14,190
uh that feedback I mean basically as no
one described it was immediate when we

24308
08:04:14,190 --> 08:04:14,200
one described it was immediate when we
 

24309
08:04:14,200 --> 08:04:16,308
one described it was immediate when we
flipped that switch uh I think the first

24310
08:04:16,308 --> 08:04:16,318
flipped that switch uh I think the first
 

24311
08:04:16,318 --> 08:04:17,388
flipped that switch uh I think the first
day we did that you hit three or four

24312
08:04:17,388 --> 08:04:17,398
day we did that you hit three or four
 

24313
08:04:17,398 --> 08:04:19,708
day we did that you hit three or four
BPS right out of the box and that was a

24314
08:04:19,708 --> 08:04:19,718
BPS right out of the box and that was a
 

24315
08:04:19,718 --> 08:04:21,150
BPS right out of the box and that was a
light bul moment for okay this is the

24316
08:04:21,150 --> 08:04:21,160
light bul moment for okay this is the
 

24317
08:04:21,160 --> 08:04:22,948
light bul moment for okay this is the
right path to go down and from there

24318
08:04:22,948 --> 08:04:22,958
right path to go down and from there
 

24319
08:04:22,958 --> 08:04:24,750
right path to go down and from there
there's a lot of feedback around like

24320
08:04:24,750 --> 08:04:24,760
there's a lot of feedback around like
 

24321
08:04:24,760 --> 08:04:26,868
there's a lot of feedback around like
how to make this useful for independent

24322
08:04:26,868 --> 08:04:26,878
how to make this useful for independent
 

24323
08:04:26,878 --> 08:04:28,708
how to make this useful for independent
use so what we about ultimately is that

24324
08:04:28,708 --> 08:04:28,718
use so what we about ultimately is that
 

24325
08:04:28,718 --> 08:04:29,910
use so what we about ultimately is that
you can use it independently to do

24326
08:04:29,910 --> 08:04:29,920
you can use it independently to do
 

24327
08:04:29,920 --> 08:04:32,030
you can use it independently to do
whatever you want and uh to get to that

24328
08:04:32,030 --> 08:04:32,040
whatever you want and uh to get to that
 

24329
08:04:32,040 --> 08:04:33,430
whatever you want and uh to get to that
point it required us to re-engineer the

24330
08:04:33,430 --> 08:04:33,440
point it required us to re-engineer the
 

24331
08:04:33,440 --> 08:04:35,468
point it required us to re-engineer the
ux as you talked about the dwell cursor

24332
08:04:35,468 --> 08:04:35,478
ux as you talked about the dwell cursor
 

24333
08:04:35,478 --> 08:04:36,548
ux as you talked about the dwell cursor
to make it something that you can use

24334
08:04:36,548 --> 08:04:36,558
to make it something that you can use
 

24335
08:04:36,558 --> 08:04:37,788
to make it something that you can use
independently without us need to be

24336
08:04:37,788 --> 08:04:37,798
independently without us need to be
 

24337
08:04:37,798 --> 08:04:39,910
independently without us need to be
involved all the time and uh yeah this

24338
08:04:39,910 --> 08:04:39,920
involved all the time and uh yeah this
 

24339
08:04:39,920 --> 08:04:41,030
involved all the time and uh yeah this
is obviously the start of this journey

24340
08:04:41,030 --> 08:04:41,040
is obviously the start of this journey
 

24341
08:04:41,040 --> 08:04:42,110
is obviously the start of this journey
still hopefully we get back to the

24342
08:04:42,110 --> 08:04:42,120
still hopefully we get back to the
 

24343
08:04:42,120 --> 08:04:43,670
still hopefully we get back to the
places where you're doing multiple

24344
08:04:43,670 --> 08:04:43,680
places where you're doing multiple
 

24345
08:04:43,680 --> 08:04:46,230
places where you're doing multiple
clicks and uh using that to control much

24346
08:04:46,230 --> 08:04:46,240
clicks and uh using that to control much
 

24347
08:04:46,240 --> 08:04:47,830
clicks and uh using that to control much
more fluidly everything and much more

24348
08:04:47,830 --> 08:04:47,840
more fluidly everything and much more
 

24349
08:04:47,840 --> 08:04:49,270
more fluidly everything and much more
naturally the applications that you're

24350
08:04:49,270 --> 08:04:49,280
naturally the applications that you're
 

24351
08:04:49,280 --> 08:04:52,468
naturally the applications that you're
trying to interface with and most

24352
08:04:52,468 --> 08:04:52,478
trying to interface with and most
 

24353
08:04:52,478 --> 08:04:55,670
trying to interface with and most
importantly get that web grid number up

24354
08:04:55,670 --> 08:04:55,680
importantly get that web grid number up
 

24355
08:04:55,680 --> 08:04:58,350
importantly get that web grid number up
yes yeah so how's the

24356
08:04:58,350 --> 08:04:58,360
yes yeah so how's the
 

24357
08:04:58,360 --> 08:04:59,468
yes yeah so how's the
on the hover

24358
08:04:59,468 --> 08:04:59,478
on the hover
 

24359
08:04:59,478 --> 08:05:02,110
on the hover
click do you accidentally click stuff

24360
08:05:02,110 --> 08:05:02,120
click do you accidentally click stuff
 

24361
08:05:02,120 --> 08:05:04,070
click do you accidentally click stuff
sometimes y like what's how hard is it

24362
08:05:04,070 --> 08:05:04,080
sometimes y like what's how hard is it
 

24363
08:05:04,080 --> 08:05:07,070
sometimes y like what's how hard is it
to avoid accidentally clicking I have to

24364
08:05:07,070 --> 08:05:07,080
to avoid accidentally clicking I have to
 

24365
08:05:07,080 --> 08:05:09,830
to avoid accidentally clicking I have to
continuously keep it moving basically so

24366
08:05:09,830 --> 08:05:09,840
continuously keep it moving basically so
 

24367
08:05:09,840 --> 08:05:11,510
continuously keep it moving basically so
like I said there's a threshold where it

24368
08:05:11,510 --> 08:05:11,520
like I said there's a threshold where it
 

24369
08:05:11,520 --> 08:05:15,110
like I said there's a threshold where it
will initiate a click so if I ever um

24370
08:05:15,110 --> 08:05:15,120
will initiate a click so if I ever um
 

24371
08:05:15,120 --> 08:05:17,590
will initiate a click so if I ever um
drop below that it'll start and I have3

24372
08:05:17,590 --> 08:05:17,600
drop below that it'll start and I have3
 

24373
08:05:17,600 --> 08:05:19,590
drop below that it'll start and I have3
seconds to move it before it clicks

24374
08:05:19,590 --> 08:05:19,600
seconds to move it before it clicks
 

24375

a couple weeks back that I was when I
was not using the implant I was just

was not using the implant I was just
moving my hand back and forth or in

24395
08:05:45,398 --> 08:05:47,190
circles like I was trying to keep the
cursor from clicking and I was just

24396
08:05:47,190 --> 08:05:47,200
cursor from clicking and I was just
 

24397
08:05:47,200 --> 08:05:48,868
cursor from clicking and I was just
doing it like while I was trying to go

24398
08:05:48,868 --> 08:05:48,878
doing it like while I was trying to go
 

24399
08:05:48,878 --> 08:05:50,910
doing it like while I was trying to go
to sleep and I was like okay this is a

24400
08:05:50,910 --> 08:05:50,920
to sleep and I was like okay this is a
 

24401
08:05:50,920 --> 08:05:53,708
to sleep and I was like okay this is a
problem yeah to avoid the clicking I

24402

them maybe until someone is actually
actually using the app using the implant

actually using the app using the implant

24769
08:13:32,160 --> 08:13:35,150
rocking out to music and then it's also
just like a Race Against Time because

24770
08:13:35,150 --> 08:13:35,160
just like a Race Against Time because
 

24771
08:13:35,160 --> 08:13:37,868
just like a Race Against Time because
I'm constantly constantly looking at how

24772
08:13:37,868 --> 08:13:37,878
I'm constantly constantly looking at how
 

24773
08:13:37,878 --> 08:13:40,910
I'm constantly constantly looking at how
much battery percentage I have left on

24774
08:13:40,910 --> 08:13:40,920
much battery percentage I have left on
 

24775
08:13:40,920 --> 08:13:44,270
much battery percentage I have left on
my implant like all right I have 30%

24776
08:13:44,270 --> 08:13:44,280
my implant like all right I have 30%
 

24777
08:13:44,280 --> 08:13:46,190
my implant like all right I have 30%
which equates to you know x amount of

24778
08:13:46,190 --> 08:13:46,200
which equates to you know x amount of
 

24779
08:13:46,200 --> 08:13:48,230
which equates to you know x amount of
time which means I have to break this

24780
08:13:48,230 --> 08:13:48,240
time which means I have to break this
 

24781
08:13:48,240 --> 08:13:50,350
time which means I have to break this
record in the next you know hour and a

24782
08:13:50,350 --> 08:13:50,360
record in the next you know hour and a
 

24783

half or else it's not happening tonight
 

24785
08:13:52,878 --> 08:13:56,150
half or else it's not happening tonight
um and so it's it's a little stressful

24786
08:13:56,150 --> 08:13:56,160
um and so it's it's a little stressful
 

24787
08:13:56,160 --> 08:13:57,628
um and so it's it's a little stressful
when that happens when it's like when

08:14:30,110 --> 08:14:30,120
I'm like all right that means I have you
 

24821
08:14:30,120 --> 08:14:32,670
I'm like all right that means I have you
know 10 minutes left before this thing's

24822
08:14:32,670 --> 08:14:32,680
know 10 minutes left before this thing's
 

24823
08:14:32,680 --> 08:14:34,548
know 10 minutes left before this thing's
dead that's what's going on in my head

24824
08:14:34,548 --> 08:14:34,558
dead that's what's going on in my head
 

24825
08:14:34,558 --> 08:14:36,150
dead that's what's going on in my head
generally that and whatever song is

24826
08:14:36,150 --> 08:14:36,160
generally that and whatever song is
 

24827
08:14:36,160 --> 08:14:40,110
generally that and whatever song is
playing um and I just I just want I want

24828
08:14:40,110 --> 08:14:40,120
playing um and I just I just want I want
 

24829
08:14:40,120 --> 08:14:43,110
playing um and I just I just want I want
to break those records so bad like it's

24830
08:14:43,110 --> 08:14:43,120
to break those records so bad like it's
 

24831
08:14:43,120 --> 08:14:45,468
to break those records so bad like it's
all I want when I'm playing web grid it

24832
08:14:45,468 --> 08:14:45,478
all I want when I'm playing web grid it
 

24833
08:14:45,478 --> 08:14:48,228
all I want when I'm playing web grid it
it has become less of like oh this is

24834
08:14:48,228 --> 08:14:48,238
it has become less of like oh this is
 

24835
08:14:48,238 --> 08:14:50,510
it has become less of like oh this is
just a leisurely activity like I just

24836
08:14:50,510 --> 08:14:50,520
just a leisurely activity like I just
 

24837
08:14:50,520 --> 08:14:52,468
just a leisurely activity like I just
enjoy doing this because it just feels

24838
08:14:52,468 --> 08:14:52,478
enjoy doing this because it just feels
 

24839
08:14:52,478 --> 08:14:54,910
enjoy doing this because it just feels
so nice and it puts me at ease it is no

24840
08:14:54,910 --> 08:14:54,920
so nice and it puts me at ease it is no
 

24841
08:14:54,920 --> 08:14:57,070
so nice and it puts me at ease it is no
once I'm in web grid you better break

24842
08:14:57,070 --> 08:14:57,080
once I'm in web grid you better break
 

24843
08:14:57,080 --> 08:14:58,388
once I'm in web grid you better break
this record or you're going to waste

24844
08:14:58,388 --> 08:14:58,398
this record or you're going to waste
 

24845
08:14:58,398 --> 08:15:01,910
this record or you're going to waste
like 5 hours of your life right now and

24846
08:15:01,910 --> 08:15:01,920
like 5 hours of your life right now and
 

24847
08:15:01,920 --> 08:15:05,030
like 5 hours of your life right now and
um I don't know it's just fun it's fun

24848
08:15:05,030 --> 08:15:05,040
um I don't know it's just fun it's fun
 

24849
08:15:05,040 --> 08:15:06,788
um I don't know it's just fun it's fun
man uh have you ever tried web grid with

24850
08:15:06,788 --> 08:15:06,798
man uh have you ever tried web grid with
 

24851
08:15:06,798 --> 08:15:08,628
man uh have you ever tried web grid with
like two Targets and three targets can

24852
08:15:08,628 --> 08:15:08,638
like two Targets and three targets can
 

24853
08:15:08,638 --> 08:15:10,868
like two Targets and three targets can
you get higher BPS with that can you can

24854
08:15:10,868 --> 08:15:10,878
you get higher BPS with that can you can
 

24855
08:15:10,878 --> 08:15:12,868
you get higher BPS with that can you can
you do that you mean like different

24856
08:15:12,868 --> 08:15:12,878
you do that you mean like different
 

24857
08:15:12,878 --> 08:15:14,788
you do that you mean like different
color targets or you being oh multiple

24858
08:15:14,788 --> 08:15:14,798
color targets or you being oh multiple
 

24859
08:15:14,798 --> 08:15:16,548
color targets or you being oh multiple
targets does that change the thing yeah

24860
08:15:16,548 --> 08:15:16,558
targets does that change the thing yeah
 

24861
08:15:16,558 --> 08:15:18,788
targets does that change the thing yeah
so BPS is a log of number of targets

24862
08:15:18,788 --> 08:15:18,798
so BPS is a log of number of targets
 

24863
08:15:18,798 --> 08:15:21,070
so BPS is a log of number of targets
times correct minus incorrect divided by

24864
08:15:21,070 --> 08:15:21,080
times correct minus incorrect divided by
 

24865
08:15:21,080 --> 08:15:22,270
times correct minus incorrect divided by
time and so you can think of like

24866
08:15:22,270 --> 08:15:22,280
time and so you can think of like
 

24867
08:15:22,280 --> 08:15:24,270
time and so you can think of like
different clicks as basically doubling

24868
08:15:24,270 --> 08:15:24,280
different clicks as basically doubling
 

24869
08:15:24,280 --> 08:15:26,388
different clicks as basically doubling
the number of active targets got it so

24870
08:15:26,388 --> 08:15:26,398
the number of active targets got it so
 

24871
08:15:26,398 --> 08:15:28,308
the number of active targets got it so
you know you basically higher BPS the

24872
08:15:28,308 --> 08:15:28,318
you know you basically higher BPS the
 

24873
08:15:28,318 --> 08:15:29,468
you know you basically higher BPS the
more options there are the more

24874
08:15:29,468 --> 08:15:29,478
more options there are the more
 

24875
08:15:29,478 --> 08:15:31,548
more options there are the more
difficult to task and uh there's also

24876
08:15:31,548 --> 08:15:31,558
difficult to task and uh there's also
 

24877
08:15:31,558 --> 08:15:32,990
difficult to task and uh there's also
like Zen mode you've played in before

24878
08:15:32,990 --> 08:15:33,000
like Zen mode you've played in before
 

24879
08:15:33,000 --> 08:15:35,350
like Zen mode you've played in before
which is like infinite can covers it

24880
08:15:35,350 --> 08:15:35,360
which is like infinite can covers it
 

24881
08:15:35,360 --> 08:15:39,430
which is like infinite can covers it
covers the whole screen with a grid and

24882
08:15:39,430 --> 08:15:39,440
covers the whole screen with a grid and
 

24883
08:15:39,440 --> 08:15:42,190
covers the whole screen with a grid and
um I don't know what yeah and so you can

24884
08:15:42,190 --> 08:15:42,200
um I don't know what yeah and so you can
 

24885
08:15:42,200 --> 08:15:45,190
um I don't know what yeah and so you can
go like that's that's insane yeah he

24886
08:15:45,190 --> 08:15:45,200
go like that's that's insane yeah he
 

24887
08:15:45,200 --> 08:15:46,110
go like that's that's insane yeah he
doesn't like it because it didn't show

24888
08:15:46,110 --> 08:15:46,120
doesn't like it because it didn't show
 

24889
08:15:46,120 --> 08:15:49,350
doesn't like it because it didn't show
BPS so like you know oh yeah I had them

24890
08:15:49,350 --> 08:15:49,360
BPS so like you know oh yeah I had them
 

24891
08:15:49,360 --> 08:15:52,190
BPS so like you know oh yeah I had them
I had them put in a giant BPS in the

24892
08:15:52,190 --> 08:15:52,200
I had them put in a giant BPS in the
 

24893
08:15:52,200 --> 08:15:54,150
I had them put in a giant BPS in the
background so now it's like the opposite

24894
08:15:54,150 --> 08:15:54,160
background so now it's like the opposite
 

24895
08:15:54,160 --> 08:15:56,948
background so now it's like the opposite
of Zen mode it's like it's like super

24896
08:15:56,948 --> 08:15:56,958
of Zen mode it's like it's like super
 

24897
08:15:56,958 --> 08:15:59,548
of Zen mode it's like it's like super
hard mode like just metal mode if it's

24898
08:15:59,548 --> 08:15:59,558
hard mode like just metal mode if it's
 

24899
08:15:59,558 --> 08:16:01,430
hard mode like just metal mode if it's
just like a giant number in the back C

24900
08:16:01,430 --> 08:16:01,440
just like a giant number in the back C
 

24901
08:16:01,440 --> 08:16:02,910
just like a giant number in the back C
we should name that metal mode is a much

24902
08:16:02,910 --> 08:16:02,920
we should name that metal mode is a much
 

24903
08:16:02,920 --> 08:16:04,030
we should name that metal mode is a much
better

24904
08:16:04,030 --> 08:16:04,040
better
 

24905
08:16:04,040 --> 08:16:08,308
better
name so you also play Civilization 6 I

24906
08:16:08,308 --> 08:16:08,318
name so you also play Civilization 6 I
 

24907
08:16:08,318 --> 08:16:10,708
name so you also play Civilization 6 I
love Civ six yeah um usually go with

24908
08:16:10,708 --> 08:16:10,718
love Civ six yeah um usually go with
 

24909
08:16:10,718 --> 08:16:14,228
love Civ six yeah um usually go with
Korea I do yeah so the great part about

24910
08:16:14,228 --> 08:16:14,238
Korea I do yeah so the great part about
 

24911
08:16:14,238 --> 08:16:17,548
Korea I do yeah so the great part about
Korea is they um focus on like Science

24912
08:16:17,548 --> 08:16:17,558
Korea is they um focus on like Science
 

24913
08:16:17,558 --> 08:16:20,070
Korea is they um focus on like Science
Tech victories which was not planned

24914
08:16:20,070 --> 08:16:20,080
Tech victories which was not planned
 

24915
08:16:20,080 --> 08:16:22,350
Tech victories which was not planned
like I've been playing Korea for years

24916
08:16:22,350 --> 08:16:22,360
like I've been playing Korea for years
 

24917
08:16:22,360 --> 08:16:23,910
like I've been playing Korea for years
and then all of the nuring stuff

24918
08:16:23,910 --> 08:16:23,920
and then all of the nuring stuff
 

24919
08:16:23,920 --> 08:16:27,670
and then all of the nuring stuff
happened um so it kind of aligns

24920
08:16:27,670 --> 08:16:27,680
happened um so it kind of aligns
 

24921
08:16:27,680 --> 08:16:31,430
happened um so it kind of aligns
um but what I've noticed with tech

24922
08:16:31,430 --> 08:16:31,440
um but what I've noticed with tech
 

24923
08:16:31,440 --> 08:16:35,190
um but what I've noticed with tech
victories is if you can just rush Tech

24924
08:16:35,190 --> 08:16:35,200
victories is if you can just rush Tech
 

24925
08:16:35,200 --> 08:16:39,750
victories is if you can just rush Tech
Rush science um then you can do anything

24926
08:16:39,750 --> 08:16:39,760
Rush science um then you can do anything
 

24927
08:16:39,760 --> 08:16:41,628
Rush science um then you can do anything
like at one point in the game you will

24928
08:16:41,628 --> 08:16:41,638
like at one point in the game you will
 

24929
08:16:41,638 --> 08:16:43,910
like at one point in the game you will
be so far ahead of everyone

24930
08:16:43,910 --> 08:16:43,920
be so far ahead of everyone
 

24931
08:16:43,920 --> 08:16:46,910
be so far ahead of everyone
technologically that you will have like

24932
08:16:46,910 --> 08:16:46,920
technologically that you will have like
 

24933
08:16:46,920 --> 08:16:50,228
technologically that you will have like
musket men infantrymen planes sometimes

24934
08:16:50,228 --> 08:16:50,238
musket men infantrymen planes sometimes
 

24935
08:16:50,238 --> 08:16:51,590
musket men infantrymen planes sometimes
and people will still be fighting with

24936
08:16:51,590 --> 08:16:51,600
and people will still be fighting with
 

24937
08:16:51,600 --> 08:16:54,190
and people will still be fighting with
like bows and arrows and so if you want

24938
08:16:54,190 --> 08:16:54,200
like bows and arrows and so if you want
 

24939
08:16:54,200 --> 08:16:57,228
like bows and arrows and so if you want
to win a domination Victory you just get

24940
08:16:57,228 --> 08:16:57,238
to win a domination Victory you just get
 

24941
08:16:57,238 --> 08:16:59,150
to win a domination Victory you just get
to a certain point with the science and

24942
08:16:59,150 --> 08:16:59,160
to a certain point with the science and
 

24943
08:16:59,160 --> 08:17:00,868
to a certain point with the science and
then go and wipe out the rest of the

24944
08:17:00,868 --> 08:17:00,878
then go and wipe out the rest of the
 

24945
08:17:00,878 --> 08:17:05,350
then go and wipe out the rest of the
world or um you can just take science

24946
08:17:05,350 --> 08:17:05,360
world or um you can just take science
 

24947
08:17:05,360 --> 08:17:07,190
world or um you can just take science
all the way and win that way and you're

24948
08:17:07,190 --> 08:17:07,200
all the way and win that way and you're
 

24949
08:17:07,200 --> 08:17:08,590
all the way and win that way and you're
going to be so far ahead of everyone

24950
08:17:08,590 --> 08:17:08,600
going to be so far ahead of everyone
 

24951
08:17:08,600 --> 08:17:10,070
going to be so far ahead of everyone
because you're producing so much science

24952
08:17:10,070 --> 08:17:10,080
because you're producing so much science
 

24953
08:17:10,080 --> 08:17:13,388
because you're producing so much science
that it's not even close um I've

24954
08:17:13,388 --> 08:17:13,398
that it's not even close um I've
 

24955
08:17:13,398 --> 08:17:16,788
that it's not even close um I've
accidentally won in different ways just

24956
08:17:16,788 --> 08:17:16,798
accidentally won in different ways just
 

24957
08:17:16,798 --> 08:17:19,308
accidentally won in different ways just
by focusing on science accidentally won

24958
08:17:19,308 --> 08:17:19,318
by focusing on science accidentally won
 

24959
08:17:19,318 --> 08:17:21,910
by focusing on science accidentally won
by focusing on science I was yeah I like

24960
08:17:21,910 --> 08:17:21,920
by focusing on science I was yeah I like
 

24961
08:17:21,920 --> 08:17:24,990
by focusing on science I was yeah I like
I I was playing only science obviously

24962
08:17:24,990 --> 08:17:25,000
I I was playing only science obviously
 

24963
08:17:25,000 --> 08:17:27,350
I I was playing only science obviously
like just science all the way way just

24964
08:17:27,350 --> 08:17:27,360
like just science all the way way just
 

24965
08:17:27,360 --> 08:17:29,670
like just science all the way way just
Tech and I was trying to get like every

24966
08:17:29,670 --> 08:17:29,680
Tech and I was trying to get like every
 

24967
08:17:29,680 --> 08:17:31,750
Tech and I was trying to get like every
Tech in the tech tree and stuff and then

24968
08:17:31,750 --> 08:17:31,760
Tech in the tech tree and stuff and then
 

24969
08:17:31,760 --> 08:17:34,228
Tech in the tech tree and stuff and then
I accidentally won through a diplomatic

24970
08:17:34,228 --> 08:17:34,238
I accidentally won through a diplomatic
 

24971
08:17:34,238 --> 08:17:38,388
I accidentally won through a diplomatic
Victory and I was so mad I was so mad uh

24972
08:17:38,388 --> 08:17:38,398
Victory and I was so mad I was so mad uh
 

24973
08:17:38,398 --> 08:17:39,948
Victory and I was so mad I was so mad uh
it because it just like ends the game

24974
08:17:39,948 --> 08:17:39,958
it because it just like ends the game
 

24975
08:17:39,958 --> 08:17:41,910
it because it just like ends the game
one turn it was like oh you won you're

24976
08:17:41,910 --> 08:17:41,920
one turn it was like oh you won you're
 

24977
08:17:41,920 --> 08:17:43,388
one turn it was like oh you won you're
so diplomatic I'm like I don't want to

24978
08:17:43,388 --> 08:17:43,398
so diplomatic I'm like I don't want to
 

24979
08:17:43,398 --> 08:17:45,190
so diplomatic I'm like I don't want to
do this I should have declared war on

24980
08:17:45,190 --> 08:17:45,200
do this I should have declared war on
 

24981
08:17:45,200 --> 08:17:47,590
do this I should have declared war on
more people or something um it was

24982
08:17:47,590 --> 08:17:47,600
more people or something um it was
 

24983
08:17:47,600 --> 08:17:50,228
more people or something um it was
terrible but you don't need like giant

24984
08:17:50,228 --> 08:17:50,238
terrible but you don't need like giant
 

24985
08:17:50,238 --> 08:17:52,110
terrible but you don't need like giant
civilizations with tech especially with

24986
08:17:52,110 --> 08:17:52,120
civilizations with tech especially with
 

24987
08:17:52,120 --> 08:17:54,868
civilizations with tech especially with
Korea you can keep it pretty small so I

24988
08:17:54,868 --> 08:17:54,878
Korea you can keep it pretty small so I
 

24989
08:17:54,878 --> 08:17:56,990
Korea you can keep it pretty small so I
generally just you know get to a certain

24990
08:17:56,990 --> 08:17:57,000
generally just you know get to a certain
 

24991
08:17:57,000 --> 08:17:59,308
generally just you know get to a certain
military unit and put them all around my

24992
08:17:59,308 --> 08:17:59,318
military unit and put them all around my
 

24993
08:17:59,318 --> 08:18:02,110
military unit and put them all around my
border to keep everyone out and then I

24994
08:18:02,110 --> 08:18:02,120
border to keep everyone out and then I
 

24995
08:18:02,120 --> 08:18:05,228
border to keep everyone out and then I
will just build up so very isolationist

24996
08:18:05,228 --> 08:18:05,238
will just build up so very isolationist
 

24997
08:18:05,238 --> 08:18:07,468
will just build up so very isolationist
um nice just work on the science and the

24998
08:18:07,468 --> 08:18:07,478
um nice just work on the science and the
 

24999
08:18:07,478 --> 08:18:09,830
um nice just work on the science and the
tech that's it you're making it sound so

25000
08:18:09,830 --> 08:18:09,840
tech that's it you're making it sound so
 

25001
08:18:09,840 --> 08:18:12,070
tech that's it you're making it sound so
fun it's so much fun and I also saw a

25002
08:18:12,070 --> 08:18:12,080
fun it's so much fun and I also saw a
 

25003
08:18:12,080 --> 08:18:14,190
fun it's so much fun and I also saw a
civilization 7 trailer oh man I'm so

25004
08:18:14,190 --> 08:18:14,200
civilization 7 trailer oh man I'm so
 

25005
08:18:14,200 --> 08:18:16,190
civilization 7 trailer oh man I'm so
pumped and that's probably coming out

25006
08:18:16,190 --> 08:18:16,200
pumped and that's probably coming out
 

25007
08:18:16,200 --> 08:18:18,788
pumped and that's probably coming out
come on S7 hit me up I'll alpha beta

25008
08:18:18,788 --> 08:18:18,798
come on S7 hit me up I'll alpha beta
 

25009
08:18:18,798 --> 08:18:20,548
come on S7 hit me up I'll alpha beta
test whatever that'd be wait when does

25010
08:18:20,548 --> 08:18:20,558
test whatever that'd be wait when does
 

25011
08:18:20,558 --> 08:18:23,948
test whatever that'd be wait when does
it coming us yeah yeah next year yeah

25012
08:18:23,948 --> 08:18:23,958
it coming us yeah yeah next year yeah
 

25013

08:18:25,308 --> 08:18:25,318
what other stuff would you like to see
 

25015
08:18:25,318 --> 08:18:27,708
what other stuff would you like to see
improved uh about your link app and just

25016
08:18:27,708 --> 08:18:27,718
improved uh about your link app and just
 

25017
08:18:27,718 --> 08:18:31,510
improved uh about your link app and just
the entire experience I would like to

25018
08:18:31,510 --> 08:18:31,520
the entire experience I would like to
 

25019
08:18:31,520 --> 08:18:35,150
the entire experience I would like to
like I said get back to the um like

25020
08:18:35,150 --> 08:18:35,160
like I said get back to the um like
 

25021
08:18:35,160 --> 08:18:37,388
like I said get back to the um like
click on demand like the regular clicks

25022
08:18:37,388 --> 08:18:37,398
click on demand like the regular clicks
 

25023
08:18:37,398 --> 08:18:39,628
click on demand like the regular clicks
that would be great uh I would like to

25024
08:18:39,628 --> 08:18:39,638
that would be great uh I would like to
 

25025
08:18:39,638 --> 08:18:42,750
that would be great uh I would like to
be able to connect to more devices right

25026
08:18:42,750 --> 08:18:42,760
be able to connect to more devices right
 

25027
08:18:42,760 --> 08:18:44,628
be able to connect to more devices right
now it's just the computer I'd like to

25028
08:18:44,628 --> 08:18:44,638
now it's just the computer I'd like to
 

25029
08:18:44,638 --> 08:18:47,670
now it's just the computer I'd like to
be able to use it on my phone or use it

25030
08:18:47,670 --> 08:18:47,680
be able to use it on my phone or use it
 

25031
08:18:47,680 --> 08:18:50,190
be able to use it on my phone or use it
on different consoles different uh

25032
08:18:50,190 --> 08:18:50,200
on different consoles different uh
 

25033
08:18:50,200 --> 08:18:53,388
on different consoles different uh
platforms um I'd like to be able to

25034
08:18:53,388 --> 08:18:53,398
platforms um I'd like to be able to
 

25035
08:18:53,398 --> 08:18:54,910
platforms um I'd like to be able to
control as much stuff as possible

25036
08:18:54,910 --> 08:18:54,920
control as much stuff as possible
 

25037
08:18:54,920 --> 08:18:57,350
control as much stuff as possible
honestly um

25038
08:18:57,350 --> 08:18:57,360
honestly um
 

25039
08:18:57,360 --> 08:18:59,468
honestly um
like an Optimus robot would be pretty

25040
08:18:59,468 --> 08:18:59,478
like an Optimus robot would be pretty
 

25041
08:18:59,478 --> 08:19:01,590
like an Optimus robot would be pretty
cool that would be sick if I could

25042
08:19:01,590 --> 08:19:01,600
cool that would be sick if I could
 

25043
08:19:01,600 --> 08:19:04,388
cool that would be sick if I could
control an Optimus robot uh the link app

25044
08:19:04,388 --> 08:19:04,398
control an Optimus robot uh the link app
 

25045
08:19:04,398 --> 08:19:09,030
control an Optimus robot uh the link app
itself um it seems like we are getting

25046
08:19:09,030 --> 08:19:09,040
itself um it seems like we are getting
 

25047
08:19:09,040 --> 08:19:14,868
itself um it seems like we are getting
pretty um dialed in to what um it might

25048
08:19:14,868 --> 08:19:14,878
pretty um dialed in to what um it might
 

25049
08:19:14,878 --> 08:19:17,510
pretty um dialed in to what um it might
look like down the road seems like we've

25050
08:19:17,510 --> 08:19:17,520
look like down the road seems like we've
 

25051
08:19:17,520 --> 08:19:20,548
look like down the road seems like we've
gotten through a lot of what I want from

25052
08:19:20,548 --> 08:19:20,558
gotten through a lot of what I want from
 

25053
08:19:20,558 --> 08:19:22,510
gotten through a lot of what I want from
it at least the only other thing I would

25054
08:19:22,510 --> 08:19:22,520
it at least the only other thing I would
 

25055
08:19:22,520 --> 08:19:25,910
it at least the only other thing I would
say is like more control over all the

25056
08:19:25,910 --> 08:19:25,920
say is like more control over all the
 

25057
08:19:25,920 --> 08:19:30,670
say is like more control over all the
parameters that I um can tweak uh with

25058
08:19:30,670 --> 08:19:30,680
parameters that I um can tweak uh with
 

25059
08:19:30,680 --> 08:19:32,868
parameters that I um can tweak uh with
my like cursor and stuff there's a lot

25060
08:19:32,868 --> 08:19:32,878
my like cursor and stuff there's a lot
 

25061
08:19:32,878 --> 08:19:35,590
my like cursor and stuff there's a lot
of things that you know go into how the

25062
08:19:35,590 --> 08:19:35,600
of things that you know go into how the
 

25063
08:19:35,600 --> 08:19:38,750
of things that you know go into how the
cursor moves in certain ways um and I

25064
08:19:38,750 --> 08:19:38,760
cursor moves in certain ways um and I
 

25065
08:19:38,760 --> 08:19:41,070
cursor moves in certain ways um and I
have I don't know like three or four of

25066
08:19:41,070 --> 08:19:41,080
have I don't know like three or four of
 

25067
08:19:41,080 --> 08:19:42,510
have I don't know like three or four of
those parameters and there might gain

25068
08:19:42,510 --> 08:19:42,520
those parameters and there might gain
 

25069
08:19:42,520 --> 08:19:45,228
those parameters and there might gain
and friction all gain friction yeah and

25070
08:19:45,228 --> 08:19:45,238
and friction all gain friction yeah and
 

25071
08:19:45,238 --> 08:19:47,350
and friction all gain friction yeah and
there's maybe double the amount of those

25072
08:19:47,350 --> 08:19:47,360
there's maybe double the amount of those
 

25073
08:19:47,360 --> 08:19:50,030
there's maybe double the amount of those
with just like velocity and then with

25074
08:19:50,030 --> 08:19:50,040
with just like velocity and then with
 

25075
08:19:50,040 --> 08:19:53,350
with just like velocity and then with
the actual dwell cursor um so I would

25076
08:19:53,350 --> 08:19:53,360
the actual dwell cursor um so I would
 

25077
08:19:53,360 --> 08:19:55,270
the actual dwell cursor um so I would
like all of it I want as much control

25078
08:19:55,270 --> 08:19:55,280
like all of it I want as much control
 

25079
08:19:55,280 --> 08:19:57,750
like all of it I want as much control
over my environment as POS possible um

25080
08:19:57,750 --> 08:19:57,760
over my environment as POS possible um
 

25081
08:19:57,760 --> 08:19:59,670
over my environment as POS possible um
especially you want like advanced mode

25082
08:19:59,670 --> 08:19:59,680
especially you want like advanced mode
 

25083
08:19:59,680 --> 08:20:01,070
especially you want like advanced mode
you know like in like there's menus

25084
08:20:01,070 --> 08:20:01,080
you know like in like there's menus
 

25085
08:20:01,080 --> 08:20:03,190
you know like in like there's menus
usually there basic mode and you're like

25086
08:20:03,190 --> 08:20:03,200
usually there basic mode and you're like
 

25087
08:20:03,200 --> 08:20:05,670
usually there basic mode and you're like
one of those folks like the power user

25088
08:20:05,670 --> 08:20:05,680
one of those folks like the power user
 

25089
08:20:05,680 --> 08:20:08,228
one of those folks like the power user
Advan yeah that's that's that's what I

25090
08:20:08,228 --> 08:20:08,238
Advan yeah that's that's that's what I
 

25091
08:20:08,238 --> 08:20:09,990
Advan yeah that's that's that's what I
want I want as much control over this as

25092
08:20:09,990 --> 08:20:10,000
want I want as much control over this as
 

25093
08:20:10,000 --> 08:20:12,910
want I want as much control over this as
possible um so yeah that's that's really

25094
08:20:12,910 --> 08:20:12,920
possible um so yeah that's that's really
 

25095

25097
08:20:17,638 --> 08:20:20,670

everything uh has speech been useful

25098
08:20:20,670 --> 08:20:20,680
everything uh has speech been useful
 

25099
08:20:20,680 --> 08:20:22,270
everything uh has speech been useful
like just being able to talk also in

25100
08:20:22,270 --> 08:20:22,280
like just being able to talk also in
 

25101
08:20:22,280 --> 08:20:24,110
like just being able to talk also in
addition to everything else yeah you

25102
08:20:24,110 --> 08:20:24,120
addition to everything else yeah you
 

25103
08:20:24,120 --> 08:20:25,590
addition to everything else yeah you
mean like while I'm using it while

25104
08:20:25,590 --> 08:20:25,600
mean like while I'm using it while
 

25105
08:20:25,600 --> 08:20:28,388
mean like while I'm using it while
you're using it like speech to text oh

25106
08:20:28,388 --> 08:20:28,398
you're using it like speech to text oh
 

25107
08:20:28,398 --> 08:20:30,070
you're using it like speech to text oh
yeah or do you type or cuz there's also

25108
08:20:30,070 --> 08:20:30,080
yeah or do you type or cuz there's also
 

25109
08:20:30,080 --> 08:20:32,548
yeah or do you type or cuz there's also
a keyboard so there's a virtual keyboard

25110
08:20:32,548 --> 08:20:32,558
a keyboard so there's a virtual keyboard
 

25111
08:20:32,558 --> 08:20:33,750
a keyboard so there's a virtual keyboard
that's another thing I would like to

25112
08:20:33,750 --> 08:20:33,760
that's another thing I would like to
 

25113
08:20:33,760 --> 08:20:37,948
that's another thing I would like to
work more on is finding some way to um

25114
08:20:37,948 --> 08:20:37,958
work more on is finding some way to um
 

25115
08:20:37,958 --> 08:20:40,510
work more on is finding some way to um
type or text in a different way right

25116
08:20:40,510 --> 08:20:40,520
type or text in a different way right
 

25117
08:20:40,520 --> 08:20:44,190
type or text in a different way right
now it is um like a dictation basically

25118
08:20:44,190 --> 08:20:44,200
now it is um like a dictation basically
 

25119
08:20:44,200 --> 08:20:45,868
now it is um like a dictation basically
and a virtual keyboard that I can use

25120
08:20:45,868 --> 08:20:45,878
and a virtual keyboard that I can use
 

25121
08:20:45,878 --> 08:20:48,510
and a virtual keyboard that I can use
with the cursor but we've played around

25122
08:20:48,510 --> 08:20:48,520
with the cursor but we've played around
 

25123
08:20:48,520 --> 08:20:51,190
with the cursor but we've played around
with um like finger spelling like sign

25124
08:20:51,190 --> 08:20:51,200
with um like finger spelling like sign
 

25125
08:20:51,200 --> 08:20:53,910
with um like finger spelling like sign
language finger spelling um and that

25126
08:20:53,910 --> 08:20:53,920
language finger spelling um and that
 

25127
08:20:53,920 --> 08:20:56,788
language finger spelling um and that
seems really promising so I have this

25128
08:20:56,788 --> 08:20:56,798
seems really promising so I have this
 

25129
08:20:56,798 --> 08:20:59,830
seems really promising so I have this
thought in my head that it's going to be

25130
08:20:59,830 --> 08:20:59,840
thought in my head that it's going to be
 

25131
08:20:59,840 --> 08:21:03,708
thought in my head that it's going to be
a very similar learning curve that I had

25132
08:21:03,708 --> 08:21:03,718
a very similar learning curve that I had
 

25133
08:21:03,718 --> 08:21:06,430
a very similar learning curve that I had
with um the cursor where I went from

25134
08:21:06,430 --> 08:21:06,440
with um the cursor where I went from
 

25135
08:21:06,440 --> 08:21:08,190
with um the cursor where I went from
attempted movement to imagin movement at

25136
08:21:08,190 --> 08:21:08,200
attempted movement to imagin movement at
 

25137
08:21:08,200 --> 08:21:10,750
attempted movement to imagin movement at
one point I have a feeling um this is

25138
08:21:10,750 --> 08:21:10,760
one point I have a feeling um this is
 

25139
08:21:10,760 --> 08:21:13,548
one point I have a feeling um this is
just my intuition that at some point I'm

25140
08:21:13,548 --> 08:21:13,558
just my intuition that at some point I'm
 

25141
08:21:13,558 --> 08:21:16,110
just my intuition that at some point I'm
going to be doing finger spelling and I

25142
08:21:16,110 --> 08:21:16,120
going to be doing finger spelling and I
 

25143
08:21:16,120 --> 08:21:17,670
going to be doing finger spelling and I
won't need to actually attempt to finger

25144
08:21:17,670 --> 08:21:17,680
won't need to actually attempt to finger
 

25145
08:21:17,680 --> 08:21:19,350
won't need to actually attempt to finger
spell anymore that I'll just be able to

25146
08:21:19,350 --> 08:21:19,360
spell anymore that I'll just be able to
 

25147
08:21:19,360 --> 08:21:22,750
spell anymore that I'll just be able to
think the like letter that I want and

25148
08:21:22,750 --> 08:21:22,760
think the like letter that I want and
 

25149
08:21:22,760 --> 08:21:25,628
think the like letter that I want and
it'll pop up that would be epic that's

25150
08:21:25,628 --> 08:21:25,638
it'll pop up that would be epic that's
 

25151
08:21:25,638 --> 08:21:27,308
it'll pop up that would be epic that's
challenging that's that's a lot of work

25152
08:21:27,308 --> 08:21:27,318
challenging that's that's a lot of work
 

25153
08:21:27,318 --> 08:21:29,868
challenging that's that's a lot of work
for you to kind of take that leap but

25154
08:21:29,868 --> 08:21:29,878
for you to kind of take that leap but
 

25155
08:21:29,878 --> 08:21:31,990
for you to kind of take that leap but
that would be awesome and then like

25156
08:21:31,990 --> 08:21:32,000
that would be awesome and then like
 

25157
08:21:32,000 --> 08:21:33,788
that would be awesome and then like
going from letters to words is another

25158
08:21:33,788 --> 08:21:33,798
going from letters to words is another
 

25159
08:21:33,798 --> 08:21:35,708
going from letters to words is another
step like you would go from you know

25160
08:21:35,708 --> 08:21:35,718
step like you would go from you know
 

25161
08:21:35,718 --> 08:21:37,110
step like you would go from you know
right now it's finger spelling of like

25162
08:21:37,110 --> 08:21:37,120
right now it's finger spelling of like
 

25163
08:21:37,120 --> 08:21:39,110
right now it's finger spelling of like
just the sign language alphabet but if

25164
08:21:39,110 --> 08:21:39,120
just the sign language alphabet but if
 

25165
08:21:39,120 --> 08:21:40,590
just the sign language alphabet but if
it's able to pick that up then it should

25166
08:21:40,590 --> 08:21:40,600
it's able to pick that up then it should
 

25167
08:21:40,600 --> 08:21:42,708
it's able to pick that up then it should
be able to pick up like the whole sign

25168
08:21:42,708 --> 08:21:42,718
be able to pick up like the whole sign
 

25169
08:21:42,718 --> 08:21:45,948
be able to pick up like the whole sign
language like language um and so then if

25170
08:21:45,948 --> 08:21:45,958
language like language um and so then if
 

25171
08:21:45,958 --> 08:21:48,350
language like language um and so then if
I could do something along those lines

25172
08:21:48,350 --> 08:21:48,360
I could do something along those lines
 

25173
08:21:48,360 --> 08:21:51,030
I could do something along those lines
or just the sign language um spelled

25174
08:21:51,030 --> 08:21:51,040
or just the sign language um spelled
 

25175
08:21:51,040 --> 08:21:54,110
or just the sign language um spelled
word if I can you know spell it at a

25176
08:21:54,110 --> 08:21:54,120
word if I can you know spell it at a
 

25177
08:21:54,120 --> 08:21:56,670
word if I can you know spell it at a
reasonable speed and it can pick that up

25178
08:21:56,670 --> 08:21:56,680
reasonable speed and it can pick that up
 

25179
08:21:56,680 --> 08:21:59,228
reasonable speed and it can pick that up
then I would just be able to think that

25180
08:21:59,228 --> 08:21:59,238
then I would just be able to think that
 

25181
08:21:59,238 --> 08:22:01,270
then I would just be able to think that
through and it would do the same thing I

25182
08:22:01,270 --> 08:22:01,280
through and it would do the same thing I
 

25183
08:22:01,280 --> 08:22:04,110
through and it would do the same thing I
don't see why not after what I saw with

25184
08:22:04,110 --> 08:22:04,120
don't see why not after what I saw with
 

25185
08:22:04,120 --> 08:22:07,228
don't see why not after what I saw with
the um with the cursor control I don't

25186
08:22:07,228 --> 08:22:07,238
the um with the cursor control I don't
 

25187
08:22:07,238 --> 08:22:09,070
the um with the cursor control I don't
see why it wouldn't work but we'd have

25188
08:22:09,070 --> 08:22:09,080
see why it wouldn't work but we'd have
 

25189
08:22:09,080 --> 08:22:11,150
see why it wouldn't work but we'd have
to play around with it more what was the

25190
08:22:11,150 --> 08:22:11,160
to play around with it more what was the
 

25191
08:22:11,160 --> 08:22:12,468
to play around with it more what was the
process in terms of like training

25192
08:22:12,468 --> 08:22:12,478
process in terms of like training
 

25193
08:22:12,478 --> 08:22:14,150
process in terms of like training
yourself to go from attempted movement

25194
08:22:14,150 --> 08:22:14,160
yourself to go from attempted movement
 

25195
08:22:14,160 --> 08:22:16,190
yourself to go from attempted movement
to imagine movement how long did that

25196
08:22:16,190 --> 08:22:16,200
to imagine movement how long did that
 

25197
08:22:16,200 --> 08:22:18,270
to imagine movement how long did that
take so like how long would this kind of

25198
08:22:18,270 --> 08:22:18,280
take so like how long would this kind of
 

25199
08:22:18,280 --> 08:22:20,590
take so like how long would this kind of
process take well it was a couple weeks

25200
08:22:20,590 --> 08:22:20,600
process take well it was a couple weeks
 

25201
08:22:20,600 --> 08:22:23,070
process take well it was a couple weeks
before it just like happened upon me but

25202
08:22:23,070 --> 08:22:23,080
before it just like happened upon me but
 

25203
08:22:23,080 --> 08:22:26,070
before it just like happened upon me but
now that I know that that was possible I

25204
08:22:26,070 --> 08:22:26,080
now that I know that that was possible I
 

25205
08:22:26,080 --> 08:22:28,430
now that I know that that was possible I
think I could make it happen with other

25206
08:22:28,430 --> 08:22:28,440
think I could make it happen with other
 

25207
08:22:28,440 --> 08:22:30,910
think I could make it happen with other
things I think it would be much much

25208
08:22:30,910 --> 08:22:30,920
things I think it would be much much
 

25209
08:22:30,920 --> 08:22:33,350
things I think it would be much much
simpler would you get an upgraded

25210
08:22:33,350 --> 08:22:33,360
simpler would you get an upgraded
 

25211
08:22:33,360 --> 08:22:36,670
simpler would you get an upgraded
implant device sure absolutely whenever

25212
08:22:36,670 --> 08:22:36,680
implant device sure absolutely whenever
 

25213
08:22:36,680 --> 08:22:39,350
implant device sure absolutely whenever
whenever they'll let me uh so you don't

25214
08:22:39,350 --> 08:22:39,360
whenever they'll let me uh so you don't
 

25215
08:22:39,360 --> 08:22:41,190
whenever they'll let me uh so you don't
have any concerns for you the surge your

25216
08:22:41,190 --> 08:22:41,200
have any concerns for you the surge your
 

25217
08:22:41,200 --> 08:22:44,670
have any concerns for you the surge your
experience all of it was um like no

25218
08:22:44,670 --> 08:22:44,680
experience all of it was um like no
 

25219
08:22:44,680 --> 08:22:47,388
experience all of it was um like no
regrets no so everything's been good so

25220

regrets no so everything's been good so
 

25221
08:22:47,398 --> 08:22:50,708
regrets no so everything's been good so
far yep you just keep getting upgrades

the upgrade what uh future
capabilities are you excited about sort

25236
08:23:06,868 --> 08:23:06,878
capabilities are you excited about sort
 

25237
08:23:06,878 --> 08:23:09,628
capabilities are you excited about sort
of Beyond this kind of uh

25238
08:23:09,628 --> 08:23:09,638
of Beyond this kind of uh
 

25239
08:23:09,638 --> 08:23:12,228
of Beyond this kind of uh
telepathy is Vision interesting so for

25240
08:23:12,228 --> 08:23:12,238
telepathy is Vision interesting so for
 

25241
08:23:12,238 --> 08:23:14,430
telepathy is Vision interesting so for
folks who for example who are blind so

25242
08:23:14,430 --> 08:23:14,440
folks who for example who are blind so
 

25243
08:23:14,440 --> 08:23:17,430
folks who for example who are blind so
you're like enabling people to see or or

25244
08:23:17,430 --> 08:23:17,440
you're like enabling people to see or or
 

25245

for
 

25247
08:23:18,558 --> 08:23:21,030
for
speech yeah there's a lot that's very

25248
08:23:21,030 --> 08:23:21,040
speech yeah there's a lot that's very
 

25249
08:23:21,040 --> 08:23:22,468
speech yeah there's a lot that's very
very cool about this I mean we're

25250
08:23:22,468 --> 08:23:22,478
very cool about this I mean we're
 

25251
08:23:22,478 --> 08:23:24,468
very cool about this I mean we're
talking about the brain so there's like

25252
08:23:24,468 --> 08:23:24,478
talking about the brain so there's like
 

25253
08:23:24,478 --> 08:23:26,150
talking about the brain so there's like
this is just motor cortex stuff there's

25254
08:23:26,150 --> 08:23:26,160
this is just motor cortex stuff there's
 

25255
08:23:26,160 --> 08:23:28,750
this is just motor cortex stuff there's
so much more that can be done the vision

25256
08:23:28,750 --> 08:23:28,760
so much more that can be done the vision
 

25257
08:23:28,760 --> 08:23:32,030
so much more that can be done the vision
one is fascinating to me I think that is

25258
08:23:32,030 --> 08:23:32,040
one is fascinating to me I think that is
 

25259
08:23:32,040 --> 08:23:33,750
one is fascinating to me I think that is
going to be very very cool to give

25260
08:23:33,750 --> 08:23:33,760
going to be very very cool to give
 

25261
08:23:33,760 --> 08:23:35,308
going to be very very cool to give
someone the ability to see for the first

25262
08:23:35,308 --> 08:23:35,318
someone the ability to see for the first
 

25263
08:23:35,318 --> 08:23:37,750
someone the ability to see for the first
time in their life would just be I mean

25264
08:23:37,750 --> 08:23:37,760
time in their life would just be I mean
 

25265
08:23:37,760 --> 08:23:40,070
time in their life would just be I mean
it it might be more amazing than even

25266
08:23:40,070 --> 08:23:40,080
it it might be more amazing than even
 

25267
08:23:40,080 --> 08:23:41,910
it it might be more amazing than even
helping someone like me like that just

25268
08:23:41,910 --> 08:23:41,920
helping someone like me like that just
 

25269
08:23:41,920 --> 08:23:45,548
helping someone like me like that just
sounds incredible um the speech thing is

25270
08:23:45,548 --> 08:23:45,558
sounds incredible um the speech thing is
 

25271
08:23:45,558 --> 08:23:47,308
sounds incredible um the speech thing is
really interesting being able to have

25272
08:23:47,308 --> 08:23:47,318
really interesting being able to have
 

25273
08:23:47,318 --> 08:23:49,910
really interesting being able to have
some sort of like real time translation

25274
08:23:49,910 --> 08:23:49,920
some sort of like real time translation
 

25275
08:23:49,920 --> 08:23:52,910
some sort of like real time translation
and um cut away that language barrier

25276
08:23:52,910 --> 08:23:52,920
and um cut away that language barrier
 

25277
08:23:52,920 --> 08:23:55,350
and um cut away that language barrier
would be really cool um any sort of like

25278
08:23:55,350 --> 08:23:55,360
would be really cool um any sort of like
 

25279
08:23:55,360 --> 08:23:56,948
would be really cool um any sort of like
actual impairment

25280
08:23:56,948 --> 08:23:56,958
actual impairment
 

25281
08:23:56,958 --> 08:23:59,270
actual impairment
um that it could solve like with speech

25282
08:23:59,270 --> 08:23:59,280
um that it could solve like with speech
 

25283
08:23:59,280 --> 08:24:01,388
um that it could solve like with speech
would be very very cool and then also

25284
08:24:01,388 --> 08:24:01,398
would be very very cool and then also
 

25285
08:24:01,398 --> 08:24:02,910
would be very very cool and then also
there are a lot of different

25286
08:24:02,910 --> 08:24:02,920
there are a lot of different
 

25287
08:24:02,920 --> 08:24:05,708
there are a lot of different
disabilities that all originate in the

25288
08:24:05,708 --> 08:24:05,718
disabilities that all originate in the
 

25289
08:24:05,718 --> 08:24:08,670
disabilities that all originate in the
brain and you would be able to hopefully

25290
08:24:08,670 --> 08:24:08,680
brain and you would be able to hopefully
 

25291
08:24:08,680 --> 08:24:11,510
brain and you would be able to hopefully
be able to solve a lot of those um I

25292
08:24:11,510 --> 08:24:11,520
be able to solve a lot of those um I
 

25293
08:24:11,520 --> 08:24:13,190
be able to solve a lot of those um I
know there's already stuff to help

25294
08:24:13,190 --> 08:24:13,200
know there's already stuff to help
 

25295
08:24:13,200 --> 08:24:15,910
know there's already stuff to help
people with seizures um that can be

25296
08:24:15,910 --> 08:24:15,920
people with seizures um that can be
 

25297
08:24:15,920 --> 08:24:19,030
people with seizures um that can be
implanted in the brain this would do I

25298
08:24:19,030 --> 08:24:19,040
implanted in the brain this would do I
 

25299
08:24:19,040 --> 08:24:21,388
implanted in the brain this would do I
imagine the same thing and so you could

25300
08:24:21,388 --> 08:24:21,398
imagine the same thing and so you could
 

25301
08:24:21,398 --> 08:24:23,430
imagine the same thing and so you could
do something like that I know that you

25302
08:24:23,430 --> 08:24:23,440
do something like that I know that you
 

25303
08:24:23,440 --> 08:24:25,548
do something like that I know that you
know even someone like Joe Rogan has

25304
08:24:25,548 --> 08:24:25,558
know even someone like Joe Rogan has
 

25305
08:24:25,558 --> 08:24:28,910
know even someone like Joe Rogan has
talked about uh the possibilities with

25306
08:24:28,910 --> 08:24:28,920
talked about uh the possibilities with
 

25307
08:24:28,920 --> 08:24:32,750
talked about uh the possibilities with
being able to um stimulate the brain in

25308
08:24:32,750 --> 08:24:32,760
being able to um stimulate the brain in
 

25309
08:24:32,760 --> 08:24:36,350
being able to um stimulate the brain in
different ways um I'm not

25310
08:24:36,350 --> 08:24:36,360
different ways um I'm not
 

25311
08:24:36,360 --> 08:24:40,190
different ways um I'm not
sure I'm not sure what you know like how

25312
08:24:40,190 --> 08:24:40,200
sure I'm not sure what you know like how
 

25313
08:24:40,200 --> 08:24:42,670
sure I'm not sure what you know like how
ethical a lot of that would be that's

25314
08:24:42,670 --> 08:24:42,680
ethical a lot of that would be that's
 

25315
08:24:42,680 --> 08:24:45,628
ethical a lot of that would be that's
beyond me honestly but I know that there

25316
08:24:45,628 --> 08:24:45,638
beyond me honestly but I know that there
 

25317
08:24:45,638 --> 08:24:47,350
beyond me honestly but I know that there
is a lot that can be done when we're

25318
08:24:47,350 --> 08:24:47,360
is a lot that can be done when we're
 

25319
08:24:47,360 --> 08:24:49,388
is a lot that can be done when we're
talking about the brain and being able

25320
08:24:49,388 --> 08:24:49,398
talking about the brain and being able
 

25321
08:24:49,398 --> 08:24:52,910
talking about the brain and being able
to go in and physically make changes to

25322
08:24:52,910 --> 08:24:52,920
to go in and physically make changes to
 

25323
08:24:52,920 --> 08:24:55,670
to go in and physically make changes to
help people or to improve their lives so

25324
08:24:55,670 --> 08:24:55,680
help people or to improve their lives so
 

25325
08:24:55,680 --> 08:24:57,388
help people or to improve their lives so
I'm really looking forward to everything

25326
08:24:57,388 --> 08:24:57,398
I'm really looking forward to everything
 

25327
08:24:57,398 --> 08:24:59,030
I'm really looking forward to everything
that comes from this and I don't think

25328
08:24:59,030 --> 08:24:59,040
that comes from this and I don't think
 

25329
08:24:59,040 --> 08:25:02,708
that comes from this and I don't think
it's all that far off um I think a lot

25330
08:25:02,708 --> 08:25:02,718
it's all that far off um I think a lot
 

25331
08:25:02,718 --> 08:25:04,510
it's all that far off um I think a lot
of this can be implemented within my

25332
08:25:04,510 --> 08:25:04,520
of this can be implemented within my
 

25333
08:25:04,520 --> 08:25:07,270
of this can be implemented within my
lifetime um assuming that I live a long

25334
08:25:07,270 --> 08:25:07,280
lifetime um assuming that I live a long
 

25335
08:25:07,280 --> 08:25:08,990
lifetime um assuming that I live a long
life what you were referring to is

25336
08:25:08,990 --> 08:25:09,000
life what you were referring to is
 

25337
08:25:09,000 --> 08:25:10,990
life what you were referring to is
things like people suffering from

08:25:10,990 --> 08:25:11,000
things like people suffering from
 

25339
08:25:11,000 --> 08:25:13,110
things like people suffering from
depression or things of that nature

depression or things of that nature
 

25341
08:25:13,120 --> 08:25:15,788
depression or things of that nature
potentially getting help yeah flip a

25342
08:25:15,788 --> 08:25:15,798
potentially getting help yeah flip a
 

25343
08:25:15,798 --> 08:25:19,110

switch like that make someone happy um I

25344

them I was like I don't know how I feel
 

25375
08:25:51,520 --> 08:25:53,228
them I was like I don't know how I feel
about like people being able to just

25376
08:25:53,228 --> 08:25:53,238
about like people being able to just
 

25377
08:25:53,238 --> 08:25:55,548
about like people being able to just
wipe parts of your memory um that seems

25378
08:25:55,548 --> 08:25:55,558
wipe parts of your memory um that seems
 

25379
08:25:55,558 --> 08:25:56,750
wipe parts of your memory um that seems
a little sketchy to me he's like they're

25380
08:25:56,750 --> 08:25:56,760
a little sketchy to me he's like they're
 

25381
08:25:56,760 --> 08:25:58,788
a little sketchy to me he's like they're
already doing it

25382
08:25:58,788 --> 08:25:58,798
already doing it
 

25383
08:25:58,798 --> 08:26:02,910
already doing it
so sounds legit uh I would love memory

25384
08:26:02,910 --> 08:26:02,920
so sounds legit uh I would love memory
 

25385
08:26:02,920 --> 08:26:05,510
so sounds legit uh I would love memory
replay just like actually like high

25386
08:26:05,510 --> 08:26:05,520
replay just like actually like high
 

25387
08:26:05,520 --> 08:26:07,628
replay just like actually like high
resolution replay of all memories yeah I

25388
08:26:07,628 --> 08:26:07,638
resolution replay of all memories yeah I
 

25389
08:26:07,638 --> 08:26:09,228
resolution replay of all memories yeah I
saw an episode of Black Mirror about

25390
08:26:09,228 --> 08:26:09,238
saw an episode of Black Mirror about
 

25391
08:26:09,238 --> 08:26:11,228
saw an episode of Black Mirror about
that once I don't think I want it yeah

25392
08:26:11,228 --> 08:26:11,238
that once I don't think I want it yeah
 

25393
08:26:11,238 --> 08:26:13,070
that once I don't think I want it yeah
so Black Mirror always kind of

25394
08:26:13,070 --> 08:26:13,080
so Black Mirror always kind of
 

25395
08:26:13,080 --> 08:26:14,628
so Black Mirror always kind of
considered the worst case which is

25396
08:26:14,628 --> 08:26:14,638
considered the worst case which is
 

25397
08:26:14,638 --> 08:26:17,708
considered the worst case which is
important I think people don't consider

25398
08:26:17,708 --> 08:26:17,718
important I think people don't consider
 

25399
08:26:17,718 --> 08:26:19,750
important I think people don't consider
the best case or the average case enough

25400
08:26:19,750 --> 08:26:19,760
the best case or the average case enough
 

25401
08:26:19,760 --> 08:26:21,628
the best case or the average case enough
I don't know what it is about us humans

25402
08:26:21,628 --> 08:26:21,638
I don't know what it is about us humans
 

25403
08:26:21,638 --> 08:26:23,788
I don't know what it is about us humans
we want to think about the worst

25404
08:26:23,788 --> 08:26:23,798
we want to think about the worst
 

25405
08:26:23,798 --> 08:26:26,788
we want to think about the worst
possible thing we love drama yeah it's

25406
08:26:26,788 --> 08:26:26,798
possible thing we love drama yeah it's
 

25407
08:26:26,798 --> 08:26:28,510
possible thing we love drama yeah it's
like how is this new technology going to

25408
08:26:28,510 --> 08:26:28,520
like how is this new technology going to
 

25409
08:26:28,520 --> 08:26:31,548
like how is this new technology going to
kill everybody we just love that like

25410
08:26:31,548 --> 08:26:31,558
kill everybody we just love that like
 

25411
08:26:31,558 --> 08:26:33,150
kill everybody we just love that like
yes let's watch hopefully people don't

25412
08:26:33,150 --> 08:26:33,160
yes let's watch hopefully people don't
 

25413
08:26:33,160 --> 08:26:34,750
yes let's watch hopefully people don't
think about that too much with me it'll

25414
08:26:34,750 --> 08:26:34,760
think about that too much with me it'll
 

25415
08:26:34,760 --> 08:26:37,430
think about that too much with me it'll
ruin a lot of my plans yeah yeah I

25416
08:26:37,430 --> 08:26:37,440
ruin a lot of my plans yeah yeah I
 

25417
08:26:37,440 --> 08:26:39,190
ruin a lot of my plans yeah yeah I
assume you're going to have to take over

25418
08:26:39,190 --> 08:26:39,200
assume you're going to have to take over
 

25419

08:26:58,308 --> 08:26:58,318
stop so you're talking about Optimus
 

25435
08:26:58,318 --> 08:27:01,270

to be able to do to control the robotic
 

25439
08:27:03,840 --> 08:27:05,788

arm or the entirety of Optimus oh yeah

25440
08:27:05,788 --> 08:27:05,798
arm or the entirety of Optimus oh yeah
 

25441
08:27:05,798 --> 08:27:07,990
arm or the entirety of Optimus oh yeah
for sure for sure absolutely you think

25442
08:27:07,990 --> 08:27:08,000
for sure for sure absolutely you think
 

25443
08:27:08,000 --> 08:27:09,150
for sure for sure absolutely you think
there's something like fundamentally

25444
08:27:09,150 --> 08:27:09,160
there's something like fundamentally
 

25445
08:27:09,160 --> 08:27:10,868
there's something like fundamentally
different about just being able to

25446
08:27:10,868 --> 08:27:10,878
different about just being able to
 

25447
08:27:10,878 --> 08:27:12,670
different about just being able to
physically interact with the world yeah

25448
08:27:12,670 --> 08:27:12,680
physically interact with the world yeah
 

25449
08:27:12,680 --> 08:27:16,270
physically interact with the world yeah
oh 100% um um

25450
08:27:16,270 --> 08:27:16,280
oh 100% um um
 

25451
08:27:16,280 --> 08:27:19,350
oh 100% um um
this I I know another thing with like

25452
08:27:19,350 --> 08:27:19,360
this I I know another thing with like
 

25453
08:27:19,360 --> 08:27:22,150
this I I know another thing with like
being able to like give people the

25454
08:27:22,150 --> 08:27:22,160
being able to like give people the
 

25455
08:27:22,160 --> 08:27:24,228
being able to like give people the
ability to like feel sensation and stuff

25456
08:27:24,228 --> 08:27:24,238
ability to like feel sensation and stuff
 

25457
08:27:24,238 --> 08:27:26,190
ability to like feel sensation and stuff
too by going in with the brain and

25458
08:27:26,190 --> 08:27:26,200
too by going in with the brain and
 

25459
08:27:26,200 --> 08:27:28,030
too by going in with the brain and
having the Nur link maybe do that that

25460
08:27:28,030 --> 08:27:28,040
having the Nur link maybe do that that
 

25461
08:27:28,040 --> 08:27:30,750
having the Nur link maybe do that that
could be something that um could be

25462
08:27:30,750 --> 08:27:30,760
could be something that um could be
 

25463
08:27:30,760 --> 08:27:32,910
could be something that um could be
translated through transferred through

25464
08:27:32,910 --> 08:27:32,920
translated through transferred through
 

25465
08:27:32,920 --> 08:27:35,308
translated through transferred through
the Optimus as well like there's all

25466
08:27:35,308 --> 08:27:35,318
the Optimus as well like there's all
 

25467
08:27:35,318 --> 08:27:37,788
the Optimus as well like there's all
sorts of really cool um interplay

25468
08:27:37,788 --> 08:27:37,798
sorts of really cool um interplay
 

25469
08:27:37,798 --> 08:27:39,270
sorts of really cool um interplay
between that and then also like you said

25470
08:27:39,270 --> 08:27:39,280
between that and then also like you said
 

25471
08:27:39,280 --> 08:27:44,228
between that and then also like you said
just physically interacting I mean 99%

25472
08:27:44,228 --> 08:27:44,238
just physically interacting I mean 99%
 

25473
08:27:44,238 --> 08:27:47,708
just physically interacting I mean 99%
of the things that I can't do myself um

25474
08:27:47,708 --> 08:27:47,718
of the things that I can't do myself um
 

25475
08:27:47,718 --> 08:27:50,590
of the things that I can't do myself um
obviously need I need a caretaker for

25476
08:27:50,590 --> 08:27:50,600
obviously need I need a caretaker for
 

25477
08:27:50,600 --> 08:27:52,430
obviously need I need a caretaker for
someone to physically do things for me

25478
08:27:52,430 --> 08:27:52,440
someone to physically do things for me
 

25479
08:27:52,440 --> 08:27:55,150
someone to physically do things for me
if an Optimus robot could do that like I

25480
08:27:55,150 --> 08:27:55,160
if an Optimus robot could do that like I
 

25481
08:27:55,160 --> 08:27:58,110
if an Optimus robot could do that like I
could live an incredibly independent

25482
08:27:58,110 --> 08:27:58,120
could live an incredibly independent
 

25483
08:27:58,120 --> 08:28:00,510
could live an incredibly independent
life and not be such a burden on those

25484
08:28:00,510 --> 08:28:00,520
life and not be such a burden on those
 

25485
08:28:00,520 --> 08:28:04,228
life and not be such a burden on those
around me um and that would it would

25486
08:28:04,228 --> 08:28:04,238
around me um and that would it would
 

25487
08:28:04,238 --> 08:28:08,670
around me um and that would it would
change the way people like me live um at

25488
08:28:08,670 --> 08:28:08,680
change the way people like me live um at
 

25489
08:28:08,680 --> 08:28:11,670
change the way people like me live um at
least until whatever this is gets cured

25490
08:28:11,670 --> 08:28:11,680
least until whatever this is gets cured
 

25491
08:28:11,680 --> 08:28:13,708
least until whatever this is gets cured
um but being able to interact with the

25492
08:28:13,708 --> 08:28:13,718
um but being able to interact with the
 

25493
08:28:13,718 --> 08:28:15,548
um but being able to interact with the
world physically like that would just be

25494
08:28:15,548 --> 08:28:15,558
world physically like that would just be
 

25495
08:28:15,558 --> 08:28:17,150
world physically like that would just be
amazing

25496
08:28:17,150 --> 08:28:17,160
amazing
 

25497
08:28:17,160 --> 08:28:21,270
amazing
um and and there not just like for being

25498
08:28:21,270 --> 08:28:21,280
um and and there not just like for being
 

25499
08:28:21,280 --> 08:28:22,788
um and and there not just like for being
for having it be a caretaker or

25500
08:28:22,788 --> 08:28:22,798
for having it be a caretaker or
 

25501
08:28:22,798 --> 08:28:24,788
for having it be a caretaker or
something but something like I talked

25502
08:28:24,788 --> 08:28:24,798
something but something like I talked
 

25503
08:28:24,798 --> 08:28:27,110
something but something like I talked
about just being able to read a book

25504
08:28:27,110 --> 08:28:27,120
about just being able to read a book
 

25505
08:28:27,120 --> 08:28:28,830
about just being able to read a book
imagine an Optimus robot just being able

25506
08:28:28,830 --> 08:28:28,840
imagine an Optimus robot just being able
 

25507
08:28:28,840 --> 08:28:30,750
imagine an Optimus robot just being able
to hold a book open in front of me like

25508
08:28:30,750 --> 08:28:30,760
to hold a book open in front of me like
 

25509
08:28:30,760 --> 08:28:32,788
to hold a book open in front of me like
get that smell again I might not be able

25510
08:28:32,788 --> 08:28:32,798
get that smell again I might not be able
 

25511
08:28:32,798 --> 08:28:35,590
get that smell again I might not be able
to feel it at that point um or maybe I

25512
08:28:35,590 --> 08:28:35,600
to feel it at that point um or maybe I
 

25513
08:28:35,600 --> 08:28:37,628
to feel it at that point um or maybe I
could again with the sensation and stuff

25514
08:28:37,628 --> 08:28:37,638
could again with the sensation and stuff
 

25515
08:28:37,638 --> 08:28:39,510
could again with the sensation and stuff
but being there's something different

25516
08:28:39,510 --> 08:28:39,520
but being there's something different
 

25517
08:28:39,520 --> 08:28:41,628
but being there's something different
about reading like a physical book than

08:28:41,628 --> 08:28:41,638
about reading like a physical book than
 

25519
08:28:41,638 --> 08:28:43,270
about reading like a physical book than
staring at a screen or listening to an

staring at a screen or listening to an
