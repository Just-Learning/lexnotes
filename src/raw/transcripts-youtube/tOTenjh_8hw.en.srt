873
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,749
guys that just refuse to learn things if
I just

874
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:56,759
I just
 

875
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,329
I just
what did you think it was before

876
00:15:59,329 --> 00:15:59,339
what did you think it was before
 

877
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:01,189
what did you think it was before
I would look at it and I would try to

878
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
I would look at it and I would try to
 

879
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,569
I would look at it and I would try to
sometimes like if I was at a train

880
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:02,579
sometimes like if I was at a train
 

881
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:03,889
sometimes like if I was at a train
station yeah

882
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:03,899
station yeah
 

883
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,170
station yeah
and I would look at those old clogs yeah

884
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,180
and I would look at those old clogs yeah
 

885
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,389
and I would look at those old clogs yeah
I would look at it and try to guess and

886
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
I would look at it and try to guess and
 

887
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,090
I would look at it and try to guess and
I'd kind of go I think this is the way

888
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:11,100
I'd kind of go I think this is the way
 

889
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,249
I'd kind of go I think this is the way
you know what I mean but like not fully

890
00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:13,259
you know what I mean but like not fully
 

891
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:14,990
you know what I mean but like not fully
you know I mean really aggressive the

892
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,000
you know I mean really aggressive the
 

893
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,550
you know I mean really aggressive the
way ancient people looked up at the sun

894
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
way ancient people looked up at the sun
 

895
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,710
way ancient people looked up at the sun
to try to tell time you looked at had a

896
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
to try to tell time you looked at had a
 

897
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,170
to try to tell time you looked at had a
clock to try to tell time right like for

898
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:21,180
clock to try to tell time right like for
 

899
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,670
clock to try to tell time right like for
instance like we don't look at the sun

900
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:22,680
instance like we don't look at the sun
 

901
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,009
instance like we don't look at the sun
right so it to me it was an obsolete

902
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:25,019
right so it to me it was an obsolete
 

903
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,889
right so it to me it was an obsolete
information to me

904
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:26,899
information to me
 

905
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,210
information to me
you already had digital yeah yeah yeah

906
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,220
you already had digital yeah yeah yeah
 

907
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,189
you already had digital yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah and so that's somehow

908
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
yeah yeah and so that's somehow
 

909
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,189
yeah yeah and so that's somehow

00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:58,860
robot no I love it you love robots oh
 

933
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,189
robot no I love it you love robots oh
yeah yeah in fact I have this

934
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
yeah yeah in fact I have this
 

935
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,429
yeah yeah in fact I have this
I think to me unless they become hostile

936
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:04,439
I think to me unless they become hostile
 

937
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,289
I think to me unless they become hostile
and it becomes like the Terminator which

938
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:06,299
and it becomes like the Terminator which
 

939
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,689
and it becomes like the Terminator which
I think could happen right there'd be a

940
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:08,699
I think could happen right there'd be a
 

941
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,010
I think could happen right there'd be a
Skynet we have to bring it down whatever

942
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,020
Skynet we have to bring it down whatever
 

943
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,569
Skynet we have to bring it down whatever
but there's definitely going to be a

944
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:11,579
but there's definitely going to be a
 

945
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,669
but there's definitely going to be a
autonomous weapon system so a lot of the

946
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
autonomous weapon system so a lot of the
 

947
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,370
autonomous weapon system so a lot of the
robotics research is being conducted

948
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:16,380
robotics research is being conducted
 

949
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,730
robotics research is being conducted
funded by the military

950
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:18,740
funded by the military
 

951
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,230
funded by the military
wow you know the military industrial

952
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:21,240
wow you know the military industrial
 

953
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,210
wow you know the military industrial
complex I know what that is yes yeah so

954
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,220
complex I know what that is yes yeah so
 

955
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,949
complex I know what that is yes yeah so
the the a lot of The Cutting Edge

956
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
the the a lot of The Cutting Edge
 

957
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,270
the the a lot of The Cutting Edge
research is done

958
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:26,280
research is done
 

959
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,450
research is done
is funded by

960
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:28,460
is funded by
 

961
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,310
is funded by
DOD Department of Defense DARPA and so

962
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:31,320
DOD Department of Defense DARPA and so
 

963
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,470
DOD Department of Defense DARPA and so
on so a lot of the robots will be used

964
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:33,480
on so a lot of the robots will be used
 

965
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,650
on so a lot of the robots will be used
in war but hopefully not most of

966
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:36,660
in war but hopefully not most of
 

967
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,570
in war but hopefully not most of
consumer robotics will be in the home

968
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:38,580
consumer robotics will be in the home
 

969
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,669
consumer robotics will be in the home
I'm just trying to terrify you no no but

970
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:40,679
I'm just trying to terrify you no no but
 

971
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,470
I'm just trying to terrify you no no but
can I ask you this though sure what

972
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
can I ask you this though sure what

you're saying to me
is is that as a layperson is that in my

976
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
is is that as a layperson is that in my
 

977
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,950
is is that as a layperson is that in my
lifetime

978
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
lifetime
 

979
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,110
lifetime
that

980
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
that
 

981
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,049
that
machines will have consciousness

982
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:54,059
machines will have consciousness
 

983
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,570
machines will have consciousness
or that I don't know computers I'm one

984
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:56,580
or that I don't know computers I'm one
 

985
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,909
or that I don't know computers I'm one
of the people well depending gear you

986
00:17:58,909 --> 00:17:58,919
of the people well depending gear you
 

987
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:00,350
of the people well depending gear you
live dangerously so I don't know how

988
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:00,360
live dangerously so I don't know how
 

989
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,330
live dangerously so I don't know how
long you're going to live so let's let's

990
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,340
long you're going to live so let's let's
 

991
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,909
long you're going to live so let's let's
put uh but I believe that Consciousness

992
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:04,919
put uh but I believe that Consciousness
 

993
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,549
put uh but I believe that Consciousness
yes could be engineered in a machine

994
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:07,559
yes could be engineered in a machine
 

995
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,430
yes could be engineered in a machine
uh or at least we can have machines that

996
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:10,440
uh or at least we can have machines that
 

997
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,830
uh or at least we can have machines that
are human-like and we believe they have

998
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:12,840
are human-like and we believe they have
 

999
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,210
are human-like and we believe they have
consciousness

1000
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,220
consciousness
 

1001
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,710
consciousness
could I ask you one last question about

1002
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:15,720
could I ask you one last question about
 

1003
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,450
could I ask you one last question about
it yes okay

1004
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:17,460
it yes okay
 

1005
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,370
it yes okay
but we'll take one more well they have

1006
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,380
but we'll take one more well they have
 

1007
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,770
but we'll take one more well they have
the smoothness of skin and will they

1008
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:21,780
the smoothness of skin and will they
 

1009
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,470
the smoothness of skin and will they
look realistic

1010
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:24,480

 

1011
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,090

you see I'm one of those people that

1012
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,100
you see I'm one of those people that
 

1013
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,950
you see I'm one of those people that
believes that visual appearance isn't

1014
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:27,960
believes that visual appearance isn't
 

1015
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,710
believes that visual appearance isn't
the magic so if you close your if you're

1016
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
the magic so if you close your if you're
 

1017
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,909
the magic so if you close your if you're
blind you can still have a connection

1018
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
blind you can still have a connection
 

1019
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,650
blind you can still have a connection
with a person

1020
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:33,660
with a person
 

1021
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,029
with a person
um people can fall in love with each

1022
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
um people can fall in love with each
 

1023
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,970
um people can fall in love with each
other through just letters so yeah I

1024
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:37,980
other through just letters so yeah I
 

1025
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,370
other through just letters so yeah I
know you're mocking me with your entire

1026
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
know you're mocking me with your entire
 

1027
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,890
know you're mocking me with your entire
energy but yes

1028
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:42,900
energy but yes
 

1029
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,870
energy but yes
um yes I believe that part too you're

1030
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
um yes I believe that part too you're
 

1031
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,370
um yes I believe that part too you're
talking about sex bots is what your

1032
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:46,380
talking about sex bots is what your
 

1033
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,890
talking about sex bots is what your
problem is getting it okay intimacy just

1034
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:48,900
problem is getting it okay intimacy just
 

1035
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,049
problem is getting it okay intimacy just
friends friends but you wanted you want

1036

friends friends but you wanted you want
 

1037
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,789
friends friends but you wanted you want
to feel the smoothness yeah like a guy

1038
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
to feel the smoothness yeah like a guy
 

1039
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,350
to feel the smoothness yeah like a guy
like you know just go what's up dude

there's no soul you're right but you
know what I mean and I'm just curious to

1050
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,200
know what I mean and I'm just curious to
 

1051
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,990
know what I mean and I'm just curious to
see you're right I was going with sex

1052

spots but yeah have you seen Whitney uh
 

1055
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,450
spots but yeah have you seen Whitney uh
Cummings is robot yeah I've seen it okay

1056
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:11,460
Cummings is robot yeah I've seen it okay
 

1057
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,890
Cummings is robot yeah I've seen it okay
yeah how did that make you feel you know

1058
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:14,900
yeah how did that make you feel you know
 

1059

she's a beautiful girl I just don't find

1060
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,220
she's a beautiful girl I just don't find
 

1061
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,370
she's a beautiful girl I just don't find
her attractive the robot or Whitney I

1062
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:19,380
her attractive the robot or Whitney I
 

1063
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,310
her attractive the robot or Whitney I
find the robot way more attractive yeah

1064
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:21,320
find the robot way more attractive yeah
 

1065
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,930
find the robot way more attractive yeah
if I had the choice robot so you were

1066
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:23,940
if I had the choice robot so you were
 

1067
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,789
if I had the choice robot so you were
turned on by the robot see I was

1068
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:25,799
turned on by the robot see I was
 

1069
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,590
turned on by the robot see I was
surprised

1070
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
surprised
 

1071
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,110
surprised
by the very thing you're saying which is

1072
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,120
by the very thing you're saying which is
 

1073
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,450
by the very thing you're saying which is
the realism of the skit like it was

1074
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:32,460
the realism of the skit like it was
 

1075
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,549
the realism of the skit like it was
quite they did a really good job on that

1076
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
quite they did a really good job on that
 

1077
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,010
quite they did a really good job on that
robot oh they did the the life when when

1078
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:37,020
robot oh they did the the life when when
 

1079
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,409
robot oh they did the the life when when
it's animated the life is not quite

1080
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:39,419
it's animated the life is not quite
 

1081
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,330
it's animated the life is not quite
there if you can tell it's a robot but

1082
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:41,340
there if you can tell it's a robot but
 

1083
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,049
there if you can tell it's a robot but
just sitting there still it has a lot of

1084
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:45,059
just sitting there still it has a lot of
 

1085
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,330
just sitting there still it has a lot of
human-like elements the texture I don't

1086
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:47,340
human-like elements the texture I don't
 

1087
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,830
human-like elements the texture I don't
know yeah yeah it's quite fast they're

the stoic type of Silence short
 

3529
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:08,749
the stoic type of Silence short
sentences that kind of conversation so I

3530

01:18:44,209 --> 01:18:44,219
it you know what I mean like he's just
 

4025
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,790
it you know what I mean like he's just
that guy yeah you know um

4026
01:18:46,790 --> 01:18:46,800
that guy yeah you know um
 

4027
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,850
that guy yeah you know um
he's also but but there is a part of me

4028
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:49,860
he's also but but there is a part of me
 

4029
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:52,370
he's also but but there is a part of me
and this is probably wrong yeah

4030
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:52,380
and this is probably wrong yeah
 

4031
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,290
and this is probably wrong yeah
but there's a part of me that feels like

4032
01:18:54,290 --> 01:18:54,300
but there's a part of me that feels like
 

4033
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:56,209
but there's a part of me that feels like
I kind of made him

4034
01:18:56,209 --> 01:18:56,219
I kind of made him
 

4035
01:18:56,219 --> 01:18:58,370
I kind of made him
yeah he would be nothing without you no

4036
01:18:58,370 --> 01:18:58,380
yeah he would be nothing without you no
 

4037
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,229
yeah he would be nothing without you no
that's not what it's saying well I just

4038
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239
that's not what it's saying well I just
 

4039
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,430
that's not what it's saying well I just
 said that's the way I heard it

4040
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:01,440
said that's the way I heard it
 

4041
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:04,850
said that's the way I heard it
that's what I meant okay but that's not

4042
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:04,860
that's what I meant okay but that's not
 

4043
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,310
that's what I meant okay but that's not
what you said it's probably wrong right

4044
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:07,320
what you said it's probably wrong right
 

4045
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,530
what you said it's probably wrong right
because he did all the things that he

4046
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:09,540
because he did all the things that he
 

4047
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,630
because he did all the things that he
has in his life he did on his own right

4048
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:11,640
has in his life he did on his own right
 

4049
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,970
has in his life he did on his own right
right but still for some reason he'd be

4050
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:13,980
right but still for some reason he'd be
 

4051
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:15,890
right but still for some reason he'd be
nothing without you that's what I'm

4052
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:15,900
nothing without you that's what I'm
 

4053
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:17,270
nothing without you that's what I'm
saying but that's what I mean yeah okay

4054
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:17,280
saying but that's what I mean yeah okay
 

4055
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:20,229
saying but that's what I mean yeah okay

01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:12,480
there is a mechanism out there where
 

4099
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,870
there is a mechanism out there where
it's just we're just a part of this

4100
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
it's just we're just a part of this
 

4101
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,050
it's just we're just a part of this
machine that's kind of like almost as if

4102
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:18,060
machine that's kind of like almost as if
 

4103
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:19,669
machine that's kind of like almost as if
things are just happening the way it's

4104
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
things are just happening the way it's
 

4105
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:20,810
things are just happening the way it's
supposed to happen or do you think

01:20:20,810 --> 01:20:20,820
supposed to happen or do you think
 

4107
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:23,870
supposed to happen or do you think
there's this random things that are hap

occurring and we're just it's chaos in
 

4111
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,610
occurring and we're just it's chaos in
that way but I don't know from a science

4112
01:20:28,610 --> 01:20:28,620
that way but I don't know from a science
 

4113
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:29,990
that way but I don't know from a science
perspective because I wouldn't be able

4114
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,000
perspective because I wouldn't be able
 

4115
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,610
perspective because I wouldn't be able
to explain it but I do believe you

in the world like certain doors open in

4122
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:39,719
in the world like certain doors open in
 

4123
01:20:39,719 --> 01:20:41,090
in the world like certain doors open in
a certain kind of way

4124
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:41,100
a certain kind of way
 

4125

not everything is like a basic like
 

4135
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:57,709
not everything is like a basic like
billiard ball model of like you have to

4136
01:20:57,709 --> 01:20:57,719
billiard ball model of like you have to
 

4137
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:58,970

how to do engineer

4162
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:25,980
how to do engineer
 

4163
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:27,649
how to do engineer
we didn't have an engineer for our

4164
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:27,659
we didn't have an engineer for our
 

4165
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:30,890
we didn't have an engineer for our
podcast and that night he was that you

podcast and that night he was that you
know I know how to do it

4168
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:32,460

different and I really believe that we
just Abe we were met we met him that

4178
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:42,900
just Abe we were met we met him that
 

4179
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,110
just Abe we were met we met him that
night for a reason you know so you don't

4180
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,120
night for a reason you know so you don't
 

4181
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:46,430
night for a reason you know so you don't
believe that

4182
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:46,440
believe that
 

4183
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:49,850
believe that
it's complicated I believe that for love

4184
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:49,860
it's complicated I believe that for love
 

4185
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:52,250
it's complicated I believe that for love
and these kinds of things but I don't

4186
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:52,260
and these kinds of things but I don't
 

4187
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,189
and these kinds of things but I don't
believe that as much for building a team

4188
01:21:55,189 --> 01:21:55,199
believe that as much for building a team
 

4189
01:21:55,199 --> 01:21:57,350
believe that as much for building a team
but that's the engineering thing I think

4190
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,360
but that's the engineering thing I think
 

4191
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,410
but that's the engineering thing I think
that's the the artist in you I'm less of

4192
01:22:00,410 --> 01:22:00,420
that's the the artist in you I'm less of
 

4193
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:03,890
that's the the artist in you I'm less of
an artist I think artists thrive in the

4194
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:03,900
an artist I think artists thrive in the
 

4195
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,110
an artist I think artists thrive in the
chaos of it so it's not only that you

4196
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,120
chaos of it so it's not only that you
 

4197
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,990
chaos of it so it's not only that you
guys met at that time is you didn't

4198
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:09,000
guys met at that time is you didn't
 

4199
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,450
guys met at that time is you didn't
probably ask in detail about his

4200
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:11,460
probably ask in detail about his
 

4201
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,850
probably ask in detail about his
qualifications or didn't didn't go

4202
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:13,860
qualifications or didn't didn't go
 

4203
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:16,070
qualifications or didn't didn't go
through a rigorous thing you just dove

4204
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:16,080
through a rigorous thing you just dove
 

4205
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,149
through a rigorous thing you just dove
in and figure it out on the Fly I think

4206
01:22:19,149 --> 01:22:19,159
in and figure it out on the Fly I think
 

4207
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:21,830
in and figure it out on the Fly I think
that's that's sort of the artist I think

4208
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
that's that's sort of the artist I think
 

4209
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,270
that's that's sort of the artist I think
I think with like if you're doing a

4210
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:23,280
I think with like if you're doing a
 

4211
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,830
I think with like if you're doing a
startup or engineering there's a little

4212
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:24,840
startup or engineering there's a little
 

4213
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,890
startup or engineering there's a little
bit more rigor in the selection process

4214
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:27,900
bit more rigor in the selection process
 

4215
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,770
bit more rigor in the selection process

you know so we both knew instinctually
 

4291
01:23:59,699 --> 01:24:01,430
you know so we both knew instinctually
that that in that way our chemistry

4292

01:33:26,639 --> 01:33:28,850
the place would you know me where it all
the the energy is generated yeah the

4792
01:33:28,850 --> 01:33:28,860
the the energy is generated yeah the
 

4793
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:31,610
the the energy is generated yeah the
generators like yeah where do I go yeah

4794
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:31,620
generators like yeah where do I go yeah
 

4795
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:34,129
generators like yeah where do I go yeah
it's a good question okay all right

4796
01:33:34,129 --> 01:33:34,139
it's a good question okay all right
 

4797
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:36,229
it's a good question okay all right
would you rather lose all your old

4798
01:33:36,229 --> 01:33:36,239
would you rather lose all your old
 

4799
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:38,390
would you rather lose all your old
memories or never be able to make new

4800
01:33:38,390 --> 01:33:38,400
memories or never be able to make new
 

4801

get to relive the memories you have
as a science guy let me ask you a

4850
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:28,080
as a science guy let me ask you a
 

4851
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,169
as a science guy let me ask you a
question sure

4852
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:30,179
question sure
 

4853
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:33,110

4857
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:39,050
yeah of course I'm I'm not of course I
am I think about it every day yeah I

4858
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:39,060
am I think about it every day yeah I
 

4859
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:41,750
am I think about it every day yeah I
yeah I meditate I'm more on my mortality

4860
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:41,760
yeah I meditate I'm more on my mortality
 

4861
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,790
yeah I meditate I'm more on my mortality
all the time right it doesn't make any

4862
01:34:43,790 --> 01:34:43,800
all the time right it doesn't make any
 

4863
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,530
all the time right it doesn't make any
sense it's terrifying it's terrifying

4864
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:45,540
sense it's terrifying it's terrifying
 

4865
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:49,129
sense it's terrifying it's terrifying
and because are you terrified because of

4866
01:34:49,129 --> 01:34:49,139
and because are you terrified because of
 

4867
01:34:49,139 --> 01:34:52,189
and because are you terrified because of
the unknown or because you believe it's

4868
01:34:52,189 --> 01:34:52,199
the unknown or because you believe it's
 

4869
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:55,129
the unknown or because you believe it's
nothingness

4870
01:34:55,129 --> 01:34:55,139

 

4871
01:34:55,139 --> 01:34:57,830

the unknown but my best guess is that

4872
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:57,840
the unknown but my best guess is that
 

4873
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:00,050
the unknown but my best guess is that
it's something like nothingness

4874
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:00,060
it's something like nothingness
 

4875
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:02,990
it's something like nothingness
and that nothingness is so terrifying

4876
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:03,000
and that nothingness is so terrifying
 

4877
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,970
and that nothingness is so terrifying
yeah the Infinity of the nothingness

4878
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:04,980
yeah the Infinity of the nothingness
 

4879
01:35:04,980 --> 01:35:08,390
yeah the Infinity of the nothingness
yeah yeah but ramdas says and this is

4880
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:08,400
yeah yeah but ramdas says and this is
 

4881
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,490
yeah yeah but ramdas says and this is
something that I always you know ramdas

4882
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:10,500
something that I always you know ramdas
 

4883
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:13,010
something that I always you know ramdas
yeah ramdas says

4884
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:13,020
yeah ramdas says
 

4885
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:16,430
yeah ramdas says
he believed that death is like removing

4886
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:16,440
he believed that death is like removing
 

4887
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:19,550
he believed that death is like removing
a tight shoe

4888
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:19,560
a tight shoe
 

4889
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,530
a tight shoe
like release

4890
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:21,540
like release
 

4891
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,689
like release
yeah

4892
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:23,699
yeah
 

4893
01:35:23,699 --> 01:35:26,510
yeah
that could be it too I think maybe when

4894
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:26,520
that could be it too I think maybe when
 

4895
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,570
that could be it too I think maybe when
we die that's initially maybe the last

4896
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:29,580
we die that's initially maybe the last
 

4897
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:33,169
we die that's initially maybe the last
feeling that we have is release and then

4898
01:35:33,169 --> 01:35:33,179
feeling that we have is release and then
 

4899
01:35:33,179 --> 01:35:34,970
feeling that we have is release and then
if that happens and there's nothingness

4900
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:34,980
if that happens and there's nothingness
 

4901
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,770
if that happens and there's nothingness
I think that's cool

4902
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:36,780
I think that's cool
 

4903
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:39,050
I think that's cool
well no that that has to do more with

4904
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:39,060
well no that that has to do more with
 

4905
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:41,750
well no that that has to do more with
the actual feeling of death which I

4906
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:41,760
the actual feeling of death which I
 

4907
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,070
the actual feeling of death which I
think some people are afraid of the

4908
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:43,080
think some people are afraid of the
 

4909
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,830
think some people are afraid of the
experience to make sure it's it's a it's

4910
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:45,840
experience to make sure it's it's a it's
 

4911
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:49,070
experience to make sure it's it's a it's
a it's one of release like you said yeah

4912
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:49,080
a it's one of release like you said yeah
 

4913
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:51,050
a it's one of release like you said yeah
but the existential aspect that you're

4914
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:51,060
but the existential aspect that you're
 

4915
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:53,030
but the existential aspect that you're
no longer exist

4916
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,040
no longer exist
 

4917
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,430
no longer exist
like all the you're doing kind of

4918
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
like all the you're doing kind of
 

4919
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,169
like all the you're doing kind of
assumes you'll live forever

4920
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:57,179
assumes you'll live forever
 

4921
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:00,470

moments in this life a few moments of
 

4933
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:17,030
moments in this life a few moments of
Joy a few moments of trauma

of suffering and that's it I know but
here's the thing and you're wasting your

4938
01:36:21,649 --> 01:36:21,659
here's the thing and you're wasting your
 

4939
