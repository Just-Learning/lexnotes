about starvation is that the people
 

1041

they're exhausted MH that's one and the
 

1045
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,990
they're exhausted MH that's one and the
other is the value of human life it does

1046

valuation of human life so those two
 

1051
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,870
valuation of human life so those two
things combined create a

don't well that's maybe because there's
a benefit like the dark the dark sense I

of you and then you come in and and it's

2656
00:54:26,069 --> 00:54:26,079
of you and then you come in and and it's
 

2657

not really Israel against the Arab word
 

2659
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,309
not really Israel against the Arab word
or the Muslim because we have to say we

2660
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
or the Muslim because we have to say we
 

2661
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,309
or the Muslim because we have to say we
 up big time but it is the the the

2662
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
up big time but it is the the the
 

2663
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,309
up big time but it is the the the
the the the Palestinians that are in and

2664
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:38,319
the the the Palestinians that are in and
 

2665
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,109
the the the Palestinians that are in and
they are being subjected to that so it's

2666
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:40,119
they are being subjected to that so it's
 

2667
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:42,230
they are being subjected to that so it's
not really like the 1.8 billion and the

2668
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:42,240
not really like the 1.8 billion and the
 

2669
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,349
not really like the 1.8 billion and the
16 million Jews and the 1.8 billion if

2670
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359
16 million Jews and the 1.8 billion if
 

2671
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:47,270
16 million Jews and the 1.8 billion if
you look at them some of them like don't

2672
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
you look at them some of them like don't
 

2673
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,109
you look at them some of them like don't
care some of them live into regimes that

2674
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:49,119
care some of them live into regimes that
 

2675
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,870
care some of them live into regimes that
being oppressed and those regimes are

2676
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:50,880
being oppressed and those regimes are
 

2677
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,870
being oppressed and those regimes are
supported by the United States in order

2678
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:52,880
supported by the United States in order
 

2679
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,309
supported by the United States in order
it's easier for me as a as a as an

2680
00:54:55,309 --> 00:54:55,319
it's easier for me as a as a as an
 

2681
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:58,030
it's easier for me as a as a as an
Empire to to take what I want from this

2682
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:58,040
Empire to to take what I want from this
 

2683
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,630
Empire to to take what I want from this
country if I control the dictator and I

2684
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:00,640
country if I control the dictator and I
 

2685
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,470
country if I control the dictator and I
tell them that his power is linked to my

2686
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:04,480
tell them that his power is linked to my
 

2687
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,990
tell them that his power is linked to my
ability to to my my desire to keep him

2688
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:07,000
ability to to my my desire to keep him
 

2689
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,309
ability to to my my desire to keep him
in power so that's why you have a total

2690
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:09,319
in power so that's why you have a total
 

2691
00:55:09,319 --> 00:55:12,069
in power so that's why you have a total
disconnect between people in power in in

2692
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:12,079
disconnect between people in power in in
 

2693
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,510
disconnect between people in power in in
the Arab and the Muslim countries and

2694
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:13,520
the Arab and the Muslim countries and
 

2695
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,270
the Arab and the Muslim countries and
the people themselves can you speak to

2696
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,280
the people themselves can you speak to
 

2697
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,870
the people themselves can you speak to
1948 you know cuz you mentioned taking

1948 you know cuz you mentioned taking
 

2699
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,870
1948 you know cuz you mentioned taking
land that's not

00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:03,200
with
 

2733
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,750
with
numbers uh I I can't pull it up right

those Arab countries didn't even have
 

2759
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,109
those Arab countries didn't even have
their independence so they would kind of

00:56:36,109 --> 00:56:36,119
their independence so they would kind of
 

2761
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:37,950
their independence so they would kind of
like send like a Cavalry or like a

to like
it this is the problem with that the

5358
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:46,560
it this is the problem with that the
 

5359
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,270
it this is the problem with that the
show as a dialect and I I construct all

5360
01:47:49,270 --> 01:47:49,280
show as a dialect and I I construct all
 

5361
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,149
show as a dialect and I I construct all
of these sentences formed of so

5362
01:47:51,149 --> 01:47:51,159
of these sentences formed of so
 

5363
01:47:51,159 --> 01:47:54,990
of these sentences formed of so
different different words for example an

5364
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:55,000
different different words for example an
 

5365
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,669
different different words for example an
iron in any in any in in any Arabic

5366
01:47:58,669 --> 01:47:58,679
iron in any in any in in any Arabic
 

5367
01:47:58,679 --> 01:48:00,350
iron in any in any in in any Arabic
dialect is an iron in Saudi Arabia it

5368
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:00,360
dialect is an iron in Saudi Arabia it
 

5369
01:48:00,360 --> 01:48:03,589

5371
01:48:03,599 --> 01:48:05,950
means ass that's one example yeah that's
one example you know so imagine if you

5372
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:05,960
one example you know so imagine if you
 

5373
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:07,870
one example you know so imagine if you
can actually construct sentences having

5374
01:48:07,870 --> 01:48:07,880
can actually construct sentences having
 

5375
01:48:07,880 --> 01:48:09,990
can actually construct sentences having
all of these things in one so I would I

5376
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:10,000
all of these things in one so I would I
 

5377
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,350
all of these things in one so I would I
would construct like a whole section of

5378
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:12,360
would construct like a whole section of
 

5379
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,750
would construct like a whole section of
my show about that so it's really very

5380
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:14,760
my show about that so it's really very
 

5381
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:16,910
my show about that so it's really very
much about like self-reflective on

01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:21,400
language and I tell them part of the
 

5389
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:22,589
language and I tell them part of the
show is like I know what's a problem

5390
01:48:22,589 --> 01:48:22,599
show is like I know what's a problem

because of the West is more advanced
 

7707
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:50,870
because of the West is more advanced
like in movies and Cinemas we kind of

7708
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:50,880
like in movies and Cinemas we kind of
 

7709
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:53,389
like in movies and Cinemas we kind of
direct it better yeah I think I think

this is the problem Wars will all
 

7761
02:34:56,520 --> 02:34:58,349
this is the problem Wars will all
continue the problem is when is going to

7762
02:34:58,349 --> 02:34:58,359
continue the problem is when is going to
 

7763
02:34:58,359 --> 02:35:00,710
continue the problem is when is going to
be the Tipping Point where we are

7764
02:35:00,710 --> 02:35:00,720
be the Tipping Point where we are
 

7765
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:02,910
be the Tipping Point where we are
actually going to destroy ourselves and

7766
02:35:02,910 --> 02:35:02,920
actually going to destroy ourselves and
 

7767
02:35:02,920 --> 02:35:04,910
actually going to destroy ourselves and
it is so easy now to destroy ourselves

it is so easy now to destroy ourselves
 

7769
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:06,710
it is so easy now to destroy ourselves
the amount of weapons and the the

7770
02:35:06,710 --> 02:35:06,720
the amount of weapons and the the
 

7771
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:09,590
the amount of weapons and the the
quality of weapons that we have it is

02:35:11,590 --> 02:35:11,600
designed to kill more effectively more
 

7775
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:14,750
designed to kill more effectively more
more more it just it is crazy it's like

7776
02:35:14,750 --> 02:35:14,760
more more it just it is crazy it's like
 

7777
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:16,389
more more it just it is crazy it's like
we can create our own destruction in

7778
02:35:16,389 --> 02:35:16,399
we can create our own destruction in
 

7779
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:18,349
we can create our own destruction in
ourself and I and I think we're not that

02:35:18,349 --> 02:35:18,359
ourself and I and I think we're not that
 

7781
02:35:18,359 --> 02:35:20,469
ourself and I and I think we're not that
far away from it just look at nuclear

7782
02:35:20,469 --> 02:35:20,479
far away from it just look at nuclear
 

7783
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:22,630
far away from it just look at nuclear
weapons the fascinating thing about

7784
02:35:22,630 --> 02:35:22,640
weapons the fascinating thing about
 

7785
02:35:22,640 --> 02:35:25,790
weapons the fascinating thing about
nuclear weapons as I've gotten to learn

7786
02:35:25,790 --> 02:35:25,800
nuclear weapons as I've gotten to learn
 

7787
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:28,790
nuclear weapons as I've gotten to learn
recently just how few people are

7788
02:35:28,790 --> 02:35:28,800
recently just how few people are
 

7789
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:32,830
recently just how few people are
involved in a full-on nuclear war that

7790
02:35:32,830 --> 02:35:32,840
involved in a full-on nuclear war that
 

7791
02:35:32,840 --> 02:35:35,510

8019
02:40:02,359 --> 02:40:04,990
we going to have like be more you
know more informed and now we we

8020
02:40:04,990 --> 02:40:05,000
know more informed and now we we
 

8021
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:06,710
know more informed and now we we
watching twerking videos and that is

8022
02:40:06,710 --> 02:40:06,720
watching twerking videos and that is
 

8023
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:09,349
watching twerking videos and that is
true but on the other side the fact that

8024
02:40:09,349 --> 02:40:09,359
true but on the other side the fact that
 

8025
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:12,590
true but on the other side the fact that
you have the in availability of

8026
02:40:12,590 --> 02:40:12,600
you have the in availability of
 

8027
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:15,630
you have the in availability of
information I I'm learning a lot and

8028
02:40:15,630 --> 02:40:15,640
information I I'm learning a lot and
 

8029
02:40:15,640 --> 02:40:17,550
information I I'm learning a lot and
there's people who are using that

8030
02:40:17,550 --> 02:40:17,560
there's people who are using that
 

8031
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:19,349
there's people who are using that
platform from that it's not the majority

8032
02:40:19,349 --> 02:40:19,359
platform from that it's not the majority
 

8033
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:21,070
platform from that it's not the majority
because you know it's not very

8034
02:40:21,070 --> 02:40:21,080
because you know it's not very
 

8035
02:40:21,080 --> 02:40:24,070
because you know it's not very
interesting and exciting but I think

8036
02:40:24,070 --> 02:40:24,080
interesting and exciting but I think
 

8037
02:40:24,080 --> 02:40:26,230
interesting and exciting but I think
there's there might be a Tipping Point

8038
02:40:26,230 --> 02:40:26,240
there's there might be a Tipping Point
 

8039
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:28,030
there's there might be a Tipping Point
where there's enough people that will be

8040
02:40:28,030 --> 02:40:28,040
where there's enough people that will be
 

8041
02:40:28,040 --> 02:40:32,030
where there's enough people that will be
aware and maybe they would collectively

8042
02:40:32,030 --> 02:40:32,040
aware and maybe they would collectively
 

8043
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:34,590
aware and maybe they would collectively
do something in order to bring back the

8044
02:40:34,590 --> 02:40:34,600
do something in order to bring back the
 

8045
02:40:34,600 --> 02:40:36,070
do something in order to bring back the
power to the small man and maybe it

8046
02:40:36,070 --> 02:40:36,080
power to the small man and maybe it
 

8047
02:40:36,080 --> 02:40:39,110
power to the small man and maybe it
sounds very naive maybe but we don't

8048
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:39,120
sounds very naive maybe but we don't
 

8049
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:42,429
sounds very naive maybe but we don't
know we don't know because we you have

8050
02:40:42,429 --> 02:40:42,439
know we don't know because we you have
 

8051
02:40:42,439 --> 02:40:45,190
know we don't know because we you have
