me
 

139
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,550
me
that we do contemplate our extinction

140
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
that we do contemplate our extinction
 

141
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,350
that we do contemplate our extinction
and that that is a creative force

142

and that that is a creative force
 

143

153
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,470

much more real i think in the past well
 

181
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,670
much more real i think in the past well
several hundred years and especially in

several hundred years and especially in
 

183
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,229
several hundred years and especially in
the past few decades where we can see

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
planetary scale so when we think about
 

189
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,830
planetary scale so when we think about
like say terraforming mars that would

190
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
like say terraforming mars that would
 

191
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,270

engineered at a planetary scale we're
 

195
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,070
engineered at a planetary scale we're
already doing it for this one just not

196
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
already doing it for this one just not
 

197

cause extinction but
 

317
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,749
cause extinction but
very soon will be even

318
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:23,759
very soon will be even
 

319
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,590

doing that on their advisory report and
 

325
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,469
doing that on their advisory report and
it's it might happen in three or four

326
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
it's it might happen in three or four
 

327
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,469
it's it might happen in three or four

years so it's the interesting
 

329
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,150
years so it's the interesting
point in history where we can actually

330
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
point in history where we can actually
 

331
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,270
point in history where we can actually
think about

332
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
think about
 

333
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,950
think about
preventing death at a species-wide level

334
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
preventing death at a species-wide level
 

335
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,710
preventing death at a species-wide level
and even resurrecting things that we

336
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:38,720
and even resurrecting things that we
 

337
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,430
and even resurrecting things that we
have

338
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
have
 

339
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,350
have
killed or that have gone away which

340
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
killed or that have gone away which
 

341
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,510
killed or that have gone away which
brings its own series of questions of

342
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
brings its own series of questions of
 

343
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,790
brings its own series of questions of
just as when you delete something from

344
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
just as when you delete something from
 

345
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,469
just as when you delete something from
an ecosystem adding something can be

346
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
an ecosystem adding something can be
 

347
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,390
an ecosystem adding something can be
completely catastrophic and so

348
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
completely catastrophic and so
 

349
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,390
completely catastrophic and so
there are no real guidelines yet on how

350
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
there are no real guidelines yet on how
 

351
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,310
there are no real guidelines yet on how
to do that but the technology now exists

352
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
to do that but the technology now exists
 

353
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,590
to do that but the technology now exists
which is pretty extraordinary yeah i

354
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
which is pretty extraordinary yeah i
 

355
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,830
which is pretty extraordinary yeah i
just been working on uh backup and

356
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
just been working on uh backup and
 

357
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,990
just been working on uh backup and
restoring uh databases quite a bit

358
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
restoring uh databases quite a bit
 

359
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,950
restoring uh databases quite a bit
recently

360
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
recently
 

361
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,870
recently
and uh you can do quite a lot of damage

362
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
and uh you can do quite a lot of damage
 

363
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,230
and uh you can do quite a lot of damage
when you restore them properly

364
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
when you restore them properly
 

365
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,390
when you restore them properly
when we bring back the madness it might

366
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
when we bring back the madness it might
 

367
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,390
when we bring back the madness it might
be uh you have to be careful bringing

368
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
be uh you have to be careful bringing
 

369
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,270
be uh you have to be careful bringing
that back yes like the best of science

370
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
that back yes like the best of science
 

371
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,189
that back yes like the best of science
the best of engineering is both

372
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
the best of engineering is both
 

373
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,110
the best of engineering is both
dangerous and exciting and that's why

374
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
dangerous and exciting and that's why
 

375
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,110
dangerous and exciting and that's why
you have to have the best people

376
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
you have to have the best people
 

377
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,189
you have to have the best people
but also the most morally grounded

378
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
but also the most morally grounded
 

379
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,830
but also the most morally grounded
people yes pushing us forward yeah

380
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
people yes pushing us forward yeah
 

381
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,990
people yes pushing us forward yeah
but on the point of duty there's a kind

382
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000
but on the point of duty there's a kind
 

383
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,110
but on the point of duty there's a kind
of sense that there's something special

384
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
of sense that there's something special
 

385
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,670
of sense that there's something special
to humanity to human beings

386
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
to humanity to human beings
 

387
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,990
to humanity to human beings
that we want to preserve and if that

388
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,000

 

389
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,350

that little flame whatever that is dies

390
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,360
that little flame whatever that is dies
 

391
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,350
that little flame whatever that is dies
that will be a real shame for the

392
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
that will be a real shame for the
 

393
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,870
that will be a real shame for the
universe

394
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:42,880
universe
 

395
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,029

this comes up a lot of what makes humans

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,110

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,030
is that awareness the frailty of life
that allows us to be

that allows us to be
 

517
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,269
that allows us to be
so urgently creative

518
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
so urgently creative
 

519
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,790
so urgently creative
create beauty

520
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
create beauty
 

521
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,190
create beauty
create innovation it just seems like if

522
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
create innovation it just seems like if
 

523
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,030
create innovation it just seems like if
you just measure humans are able to

524
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
you just measure humans are able to
 

525
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,110
you just measure humans are able to
create some

526
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,120
create some
 

527
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,430
create some
sort of subjectively beautiful things

528
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
sort of subjectively beautiful things
 

529
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,030
sort of subjectively beautiful things
and i see science that way i see

530
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
and i see science that way i see
 

531
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,470
and i see science that way i see
engineering that way and ants are less

532
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:02,480
engineering that way and ants are less
 

533
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,310
engineering that way and ants are less
efficient at that they also create

534
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320
efficient at that they also create
 

535
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,150
efficient at that they also create
beautiful things

536
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
beautiful things
 

537
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,230
beautiful things
but less uh aggressively less innovation

538
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
but less uh aggressively less innovation
 

539
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,750
but less uh aggressively less innovation
less building like standing on the

540
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
less building like standing on the
 

541
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,350
less building like standing on the
shoulders of giants building on top of

542
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
shoulders of giants building on top of
 

543
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,949
shoulders of giants building on top of
each other over and over and over where

544
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
each other over and over and over where
 

545
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,670
each other over and over and over where
you're getting like these like uh

546
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
you're getting like these like uh
 

547
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,829
you're getting like these like uh
hierarchical systems where you greater

548
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
hierarchical systems where you greater
 

549
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,829
hierarchical systems where you greater
and greater levels of abstraction then

550
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
and greater levels of abstraction then
 

551
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,389
and greater levels of abstraction then
you use ideas to communicate those ideas

552
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
you use ideas to communicate those ideas
 

553
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,590
you use ideas to communicate those ideas
and you share those ideas and all of a

554
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
and you share those ideas and all of a
 

555
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,110
and you share those ideas and all of a
sudden you have the rockets going on

556
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
sudden you have the rockets going on
 

557
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,190
sudden you have the rockets going on
into space yeah which ants have been

558
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
into space yeah which ants have been
 

559
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,949
into space yeah which ants have been
building the same structures for

560
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
building the same structures for
 

561
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,470
building the same structures for
millions and millions of years with no

562
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
millions and millions of years with no
 

563
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,150
millions and millions of years with no
real change and so that is the key

564
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
real change and so that is the key
 

565
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,630
real change and so that is the key
differentiator yet yeah that's right

566
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
differentiator yet yeah that's right
 

567
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,230
differentiator yet yeah that's right
we've got an experiment going right now

568
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
we've got an experiment going right now
 

569
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,310
we've got an experiment going right now
and maybe it'll uh change but

570
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:40,320
and maybe it'll uh change but
 

571
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,750
and maybe it'll uh change but
well yeah we will bring up some extreme

572
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:43,760
well yeah we will bring up some extreme
 

573
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,670
well yeah we will bring up some extreme
uh organisms

574
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
uh organisms
 

575
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,030
uh organisms
another thing you're

576
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:47,040
another thing you're
 

577
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,829
another thing you're
uh interested in

578
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839
uh interested in
 

579
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,829
uh interested in
okay one interesting thing

580
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
okay one interesting thing
 

581
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,430
okay one interesting thing
that comes up

582
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
that comes up
 

583
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,750
that comes up
much later in your book

584
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
much later in your book
 

585
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,750
much later in your book
is

586
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
is
 

587
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,389
is
something i also haven't thought of and

588
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
something i also haven't thought of and
 

589
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,269
something i also haven't thought of and
it's quite inspiring which is the heat

590
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:03,279
it's quite inspiring which is the heat
 

591
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,430
it's quite inspiring which is the heat
death in the universe

592
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
death in the universe
 

593
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,670
death in the universe
is something worth

594
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
is something worth
 

595
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,590
is something worth
fighting against

596
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
fighting against
 

597
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,150
fighting against
like that's also an engineering problem

598
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
like that's also an engineering problem
 

599
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,630
like that's also an engineering problem
yes you know you kind of uh

600
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
yes you know you kind of uh
 

601
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,069
yes you know you kind of uh
the i mean

602
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
the i mean
 

603
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,790
the i mean
you

604
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:16,800
you
 

605
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,550
you
seriously look at the next 500 years

606
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
seriously look at the next 500 years
 

607
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,949
seriously look at the next 500 years
and that's such a beautiful thing

608
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
and that's such a beautiful thing
 

609
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,870
and that's such a beautiful thing
you know seriously we'll talk about like

610
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
you know seriously we'll talk about like
 

611
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,710
you know seriously we'll talk about like
the uncertainty involved with that and

612
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
the uncertainty involved with that and
 

613
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,630
the uncertainty involved with that and
all the different trajectories but

614
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
all the different trajectories but
 

615
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,870
all the different trajectories but
to to seriously look at that and then to

616
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
to to seriously look at that and then to
 

617
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,269
to to seriously look at that and then to
seriously look at like

618
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
seriously look at like
 

619
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,389
seriously look at like
what happens when the sun runs out

620
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
what happens when the sun runs out
 

621
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,389
what happens when the sun runs out
what happens when the

622
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:38,399
what happens when the
 

623
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,350
what happens when the
uh

624
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:39,360
uh
 

625
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,990
uh
the universe comes to an end like we

626
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
the universe comes to an end like we
 

627
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,350
the universe comes to an end like we
have

628
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
have
 

629
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,990
have
an opportunity and a kind of duty like

630
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
an opportunity and a kind of duty like
 

631
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,230
an opportunity and a kind of duty like
you said to fight against that and that

632
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
you said to fight against that and that
 

633
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,949
you said to fight against that and that
was so inspiring to me to think

634
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:50,959
was so inspiring to me to think
 

635
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,150
was so inspiring to me to think
wait

636
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
wait
 

637
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,110
wait
maybe

638
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
maybe
 

639
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,470
maybe
we'll actually

640
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
we'll actually
 

641
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,470
we'll actually
that's a worthy thing to think about

642
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
that's a worthy thing to think about
 

643
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,870
that's a worthy thing to think about
maybe we can prevent it actually right

644
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
maybe we can prevent it actually right
 

645
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,670
maybe we can prevent it actually right
the come up with the best known

646
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
the come up with the best known
 

647
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,670
the come up with the best known
understanding current of how things end

648
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
understanding current of how things end
 

649
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,670
understanding current of how things end
the you know we have we kind of

650
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
the you know we have we kind of
 

651
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,030
the you know we have we kind of
are building an intuition and data and

652
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
are building an intuition and data and
 

653
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,590
are building an intuition and data and
models of the way the universe is the

654
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
models of the way the universe is the
 

655
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,590
models of the way the universe is the
way it started the way it's going to end

656
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
way it started the way it's going to end
 

657
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,910
way it started the way it's going to end
so our best model of the end

658
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
so our best model of the end
 

659
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,310
so our best model of the end
let's start thinking about how that

660
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
let's start thinking about how that
 

661
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,990
let's start thinking about how that
could be prevented how that could be

662
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
could be prevented how that could be
 

663
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,670
could be prevented how that could be
avoided how that could be

664
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
avoided how that could be
 

665
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,509
avoided how that could be
channeled and misdirected and you can

666
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
channeled and misdirected and you can
 

667
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,310
channeled and misdirected and you can
pivot it somehow um

668
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
pivot it somehow um
 

669
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,670
pivot it somehow um
that's really inspiring that's really

670
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
that's really inspiring that's really
 

671
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,190
that's really inspiring that's really
powerful i never really thought about i

672
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
powerful i never really thought about i
 

673
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,870
powerful i never really thought about i
thought that you know eventually all

674
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
thought that you know eventually all
 

675
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,150
thought that you know eventually all
things end

676
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
things end
 

677
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,910
things end
and that was the kind of

678
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
and that was the kind of
 

679
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,269
and that was the kind of
melancholic notion behind all of it you

680
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
melancholic notion behind all of it you
 

681
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,750
melancholic notion behind all of it you
know none of this matters

682
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
know none of this matters
 

683
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,509
know none of this matters
in a way just

684
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
in a way just
 

685
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,150
in a way just
uh to me that's also inspiring

686
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
uh to me that's also inspiring
 

687
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,470
uh to me that's also inspiring
and to enjoy the moment

688
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
and to enjoy the moment
 

689
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,310
and to enjoy the moment
to really live in the moment you know

690
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
to really live in the moment you know
 

691
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,069
to really live in the moment you know
that because that is truly where beauty

692
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
that because that is truly where beauty
 

693
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,389
that because that is truly where beauty
exists is in the moment but there is a

694
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:56,399
exists is in the moment but there is a
 

695
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,910
exists is in the moment but there is a
long lasting

696
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
long lasting
 

697
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,750
long lasting
aspect to beauty

698
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
aspect to beauty
 

699
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,430
aspect to beauty
that is part of the engineering ethic

700
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
that is part of the engineering ethic
 

701
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,350
that is part of the engineering ethic
which is like tell me what the problem

702
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
which is like tell me what the problem
 

703
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,910
which is like tell me what the problem
is and we're going to solve it

704
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
is and we're going to solve it
 

705
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,550
is and we're going to solve it
so what do you think about that the the

706
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
so what do you think about that the the
 

707
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,509
so what do you think about that the the
long scale beyond 500 years

708
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
long scale beyond 500 years
 

709
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,590
long scale beyond 500 years
is do humans have a chance

710
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
is do humans have a chance
 

711
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,670
is do humans have a chance
absolutely i think we have the the best

712
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
absolutely i think we have the the best
 

713
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,509
absolutely i think we have the the best
chance of any species and actually the

714
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
chance of any species and actually the
 

715
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,230
chance of any species and actually the
best chance that humanity's ever had so

716
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
best chance that humanity's ever had so
 

717
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,230
best chance that humanity's ever had so
i think a lot of people fear that we

718
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
i think a lot of people fear that we
 

719
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,750
i think a lot of people fear that we
could that we can or will kill ourselves

720
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:23,760
could that we can or will kill ourselves
 

721
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,790
could that we can or will kill ourselves
actually my

question is well how long do you think
 

735
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,310
question is well how long do you think
that humans or our evolutionary

derivatives will last and the answers
 

739
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,389
derivatives will last and the answers
are shockingly wide ranging some people

are shockingly wide ranging some people
 

741
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,829
are shockingly wide ranging some people
say i think we've only got 100 years

i i think
we've never been better situated to

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
we've never been better situated to
 

781
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,629
we've never been better situated to
actually last for the long term we have

782
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
actually last for the long term we have
 

783
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,990
actually last for the long term we have
even though we've also never been at the

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
even though we've also never been at the
 

785
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,350
even though we've also never been at the
greater risk of being able to destroy

786
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
greater risk of being able to destroy
 

787
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,949
greater risk of being able to destroy
ourselves ever since really the first

00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
uh tony orb has a great book about this

uh tony orb has a great book about this
called the precipice where

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,509
called the precipice where
the precipice for humanity is at one

point we made technologies that we

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
point we made technologies that we
 

799

point we made technologies that we
weren't sure whether or not they would

weren't sure whether or not they would
 

801
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,870
weren't sure whether or not they would
destroy the earth or the entire universe

802
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:30,880
destroy the earth or the entire universe
 

803
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,710
destroy the earth or the entire universe
so the math was incomplete and there was

804
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:32,720
so the math was incomplete and there was
 

805
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,230
so the math was incomplete and there was
too much air but they tested the bomb

806
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
too much air but they tested the bomb
 

807
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,110
too much air but they tested the bomb
anyway

808
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
anyway
 

809
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,190
anyway
but it's an extraordinary place as a

810
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
but it's an extraordinary place as a
 

811
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,790
but it's an extraordinary place as a
species to think we now have something

812
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
species to think we now have something
 

813
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,710
species to think we now have something
in our hands that may destroy the earth

in our hands that may destroy the earth
 

815
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,150
in our hands that may destroy the earth
and possibly a chain reaction that

816
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
and possibly a chain reaction that
 

817
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,670
and possibly a chain reaction that
destroys the whole universe

818
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
destroys the whole universe
 

819
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,990
destroys the whole universe
let's try it anyway as a as a stage that

820
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
let's try it anyway as a as a stage that
 

821
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,910
let's try it anyway as a as a stage that
we're at as a species but with that

822
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
we're at as a species but with that
 

823
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,069
we're at as a species but with that
power comes an ability to get to other

824
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:50,079
power comes an ability to get to other
 

825
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,069
power comes an ability to get to other
planets to survive long term

826
00:13:52,069 --> 00:13:52,079
planets to survive long term
 

827
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,269
planets to survive long term
and when you think about the heat depth

828
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
and when you think about the heat depth
 

829
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,949
and when you think about the heat depth
that just becomes that's a an ad

830
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
that just becomes that's a an ad
 

831
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,230
that just becomes that's a an ad
infinitum question if you keep thinking

832
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
infinitum question if you keep thinking
 

833
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,750
infinitum question if you keep thinking
well we survive we go to the next sun

834
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
well we survive we go to the next sun
 

835
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,110
well we survive we go to the next sun
and then you go to the next sun

836
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
and then you go to the next sun
 

837
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,949
and then you go to the next sun
eventually the question will be well if

838
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
eventually the question will be well if
 

839
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,389
eventually the question will be well if
you just keep doing that forever at some

840
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:02,399
you just keep doing that forever at some
 

841
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,230
you just keep doing that forever at some
point the universe either continues to

842
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
point the universe either continues to
 

843
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,750
point the universe either continues to
expand or it could collapse back in

844
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:05,760
expand or it could collapse back in
 

845
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,430
expand or it could collapse back in
itself and the heat death

846
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:07,440
itself and the heat death
 

847
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,710
itself and the heat death
is more likely at this point where it

848
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720
is more likely at this point where it
 

849
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,069
is more likely at this point where it
just keeps expanding expanding

850
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:10,079
just keeps expanding expanding
 

851
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,310
just keeps expanding expanding
everything it's too far away but even in

852
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
everything it's too far away but even in
 

853
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,829
everything it's too far away but even in
that case i think if we had a

854
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
that case i think if we had a
 

855
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,350
that case i think if we had a
fundamental knowledge of physics and

856
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
fundamental knowledge of physics and
 

857
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,550
fundamental knowledge of physics and
space time that you could try and

858
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
space time that you could try and
 

859
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,910
space time that you could try and
restructure quite literally the shape of

860
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:17,920
restructure quite literally the shape of
 

861
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,509
restructure quite literally the shape of
the universe to prevent it

862
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:19,519
the universe to prevent it
 

863
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,110
the universe to prevent it
i think we would i think we would want

864
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,120
i think we would i think we would want
 

865
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,389
i think we would i think we would want
to survive i think

866
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
to survive i think
 

867
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,670
to survive i think
you know unless we had done the math and

868
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
you know unless we had done the math and
 

869
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,110
you know unless we had done the math and
we think that there's a greater chance

870
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
we think that there's a greater chance
 

871
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,509
we think that there's a greater chance
that the next universe would form and

872
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
that the next universe would form and
 

873
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,509
that the next universe would form and
make more life maybe we would but even

874
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
make more life maybe we would but even
 

875
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,629
make more life maybe we would but even
then

876
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
then
 

877
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,230
then
i think humans have always wanted to

878
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
i think humans have always wanted to
 

879
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,829
i think humans have always wanted to
survive and and you could argue maybe

880
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
survive and and you could argue maybe
 

881
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,069
survive and and you could argue maybe
should survive because and are able to

882
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:36,079
should survive because and are able to
 

883
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,069
should survive because and are able to
engineer systems that example survive

884
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
engineer systems that example survive
 

885
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,230
engineer systems that example survive
yeah yeah and always have yeah

886
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
yeah yeah and always have yeah
 

887
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,389
yeah yeah and always have yeah
so what is this though the tsar bomb

888
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
so what is this though the tsar bomb
 

889
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,949
so what is this though the tsar bomb
yeah the hydrogen

890
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:44,959
yeah the hydrogen
 

891
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,790
yeah the hydrogen
yeah there's there's

892
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
yeah there's there's
 

893
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,509
yeah there's there's
nothing more terrifying and somehow

894
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
nothing more terrifying and somehow

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,990
nothing more terrifying and somehow

it's like humans are capable of this

900
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
it's like humans are capable of this
 

901
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,509
it's like humans are capable of this
they're capable of leveraging the power

902
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
they're capable of leveraging the power
 

903
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,350
they're capable of leveraging the power
of nature

904

to completely obliterate
everything and and to create propulsion

everything and and to create propulsion
i mean most the voyager spacecraft are

910
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
i mean most the voyager spacecraft are
 

911
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,030
i mean most the voyager spacecraft are
nuclear powered because it's still in

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,870
many ways the most efficient way to get
a tiny amount of physical material and

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:12,880
a tiny amount of physical material and
 

917
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,710
a tiny amount of physical material and
make power out of it you know so they're

00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
make power out of it you know so they're

what do you think so

934
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
what do you think so
 

935
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,310
what do you think so
the presumption that you've just

936
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
the presumption that you've just
 

937
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,550
the presumption that you've just
mentioned is let's just focus on our

938
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:34,560
mentioned is let's just focus on our
 

939
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,189
mentioned is let's just focus on our
thing yeah for now for now well i think

940
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:37,199
thing yeah for now for now well i think
 

941
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,150
thing yeah for now for now well i think
we

942
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
we
 

943
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,389
we
as far as we know with no other sentient

944
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
as far as we know with no other sentient
 

945
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,829
as far as we know with no other sentient
life on the universe that we've found

946
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:41,839
life on the universe that we've found
 

947
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,629
life on the universe that we've found
yet

948
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
yet
 

949
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,990
yet
and and i think there's probably

950
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
and and i think there's probably
 

951
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,749
and and i think there's probably
bacterial life out there just because we

952
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:45,759
bacterial life out there just because we
 

953
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,910
bacterial life out there just because we
found it everywhere we've looked on

954
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
found it everywhere we've looked on
 

955
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,350
found it everywhere we've looked on
earth it is

956
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,360
earth it is
 

957
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,870
earth it is
and there's you know halophilic

958
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
and there's you know halophilic
 

959
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,470
and there's you know halophilic
organisms that can survive in extreme

organisms that can survive in extreme
 

961
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,829
organisms that can survive in extreme
salts there are

962
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:53,839
salts there are
 

963
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,350
salts there are
psychrophiles that in extreme cold

964
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
psychrophiles that in extreme cold
 

965
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,629
psychrophiles that in extreme cold
there's you know basically organisms can

966
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
there's you know basically organisms can
 

967
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,230
there's you know basically organisms can
survive in really almost any possible

968
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,240
survive in really almost any possible
 

969
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,310
survive in really almost any possible
environment you can adapt and find a way

970
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320

972
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
to live
 

973
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,550
to live
but as far as we know we're the only

974
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
but as far as we know we're the only
 

975
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,710
but as far as we know we're the only
sentient ones and i think

976
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
sentient ones and i think
 

977
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,949
sentient ones and i think
this is the famous the drake equation or

978
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
this is the famous the drake equation or
 

979
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,790
this is the famous the drake equation or
you know how many

980
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
you know how many

00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
where is everyone is that what enrico
 

983
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,310
where is everyone is that what enrico
fermi said is the

fermi said is the

fermi said is the
why haven't we heard from anyone there

986
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
why haven't we heard from anyone there
 

987
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,629
why haven't we heard from anyone there
are these other life forms i actually

988
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
are these other life forms i actually
 

989
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,629
are these other life forms i actually
think the question is wrong

990
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
think the question is wrong
 

991
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,550
think the question is wrong
to phrase it that way because

992
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
to phrase it that way because
 

993
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,069
to phrase it that way because
the unit the earth has only been here

994
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
the unit the earth has only been here
 

995
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,389
the unit the earth has only been here
for 4.5 billion years

996
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
for 4.5 billion years
 

997
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,550
for 4.5 billion years
and we and you know life maybe only for

998
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
and we and you know life maybe only for
 

999
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,990
and we and you know life maybe only for
a few billion of those years complex

1000
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
a few billion of those years complex
 

1001
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,670
a few billion of those years complex
life only for several hundred years 100

1002
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:27,680
life only for several hundred years 100
 

1003
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,230
life only for several hundred years 100
million years of life we've actually had

1004
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
million years of life we've actually had
 

1005
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,670
million years of life we've actually had
you know in humans only the past few

1006
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
you know in humans only the past few
 

1007
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,870
you know in humans only the past few
million years since our last common

1008
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
million years since our last common
 

1009
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,269
million years since our last common
ancestor so it's not that much time

1010
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
ancestor so it's not that much time
 

1011
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,949
ancestor so it's not that much time
but if you think even further back the

1012
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
but if you think even further back the
 

1013
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,310
but if you think even further back the
universe hasn't had that much time

1014
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:38,320
universe hasn't had that much time
 

1015
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,710
universe hasn't had that much time
itself to cool and create atoms and have

1016
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
itself to cool and create atoms and have
 

1017
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,310
itself to cool and create atoms and have
them spread around the the universe

1018
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
them spread around the the universe
 

1019
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,629
them spread around the the universe
right so the current estimates 13.8

1020
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
right so the current estimates 13.8
 

1021
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,550
right so the current estimates 13.8
billion years of just the whole universe

1022
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
billion years of just the whole universe
 

1023
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,550
billion years of just the whole universe
but it spent the first five or six of

1024
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
but it spent the first five or six of
 

1025
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,829
but it spent the first five or six of
those billion years really just like

1026
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
those billion years really just like
 

1027
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,749
those billion years really just like
cooling and making enough of the

1028
00:16:51,749 --> 00:16:51,759
cooling and making enough of the
 

1029
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,350
cooling and making enough of the
stars to then make the atoms that would

1030
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
stars to then make the atoms that would
 

1031
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,990
stars to then make the atoms that would
come from supernovas so i actually think

1032
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
come from supernovas so i actually think
 

1033
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,550
come from supernovas so i actually think
we might be the first or sit one of the

1034
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:58,560
we might be the first or sit one of the
 

1035
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,150
we might be the first or sit one of the
very few or one of the early life forms

1036
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,160
very few or one of the early life forms
 

1037
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,470
very few or one of the early life forms
but the universe itself hasn't had that

1038
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,480
but the universe itself hasn't had that
 

1039
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,470
but the universe itself hasn't had that
much time to make life in the integra

1040
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
much time to make life in the integra
 

1041
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,789
much time to make life in the integra
and a galactic and universal time frame

1042
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
and a galactic and universal time frame
 

1043
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,470
and a galactic and universal time frame
you needed billions of years for the

1044
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:08,480
you needed billions of years for the
 

1045
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,069
you needed billions of years for the
elements to be created and then

1046
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
elements to be created and then
 

1047
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,549
elements to be created and then
distributed and we're only really in the

1048
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
distributed and we're only really in the
 

1049
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,990
distributed and we're only really in the
i think the last few billion years where

1050
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
i think the last few billion years where
 

1051
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,909
i think the last few billion years where
i think even life could have been made

1052
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
i think even life could have been made
 

1053
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,750
i think even life could have been made
so i think the question of wherever is

1054
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
so i think the question of wherever is
 

1055
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,750
so i think the question of wherever is
everyone is the wrong question i think

1056
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
everyone is the wrong question i think
 

1057
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,110
everyone is the wrong question i think
the question is

1058
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
the question is
 

1059
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,789
the question is
i think we are the first ones at the

1060
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:22,799
i think we are the first ones at the
 

1061
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,750
i think we are the first ones at the
party

1062
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
party
 

1063
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,390
party
let's set up the liquor let's set up the

1064
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
let's set up the liquor let's set up the
 

1065
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,909
let's set up the liquor let's set up the
food we i just think we're the first

1066
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
food we i just think we're the first
 

1067
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,750
food we i just think we're the first
ones at the party of life but more

1068
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
ones at the party of life but more
 

1069
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,830
ones at the party of life but more
people are coming

1070
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
people are coming
 

1071
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,789
people are coming
one of the early attendees to the party

1072
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:34,799
one of the early attendees to the party
 

1073
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,310
one of the early attendees to the party
yeah or maybe the for as far as we know

1074
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:36,320
yeah or maybe the for as far as we know
 

1075
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,909
yeah or maybe the for as far as we know
the first but maybe we'll get into the

1076
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
the first but maybe we'll get into the
 

1077
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,270
the first but maybe we'll get into the
local pocket of the universe

1078
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
local pocket of the universe
 

1079
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,350
local pocket of the universe
um because the parties then expand and

1080
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
um because the parties then expand and
 

1081
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,510
um because the parties then expand and
you it overflows

1082
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
you it overflows
 

1083
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,110
you it overflows
and then there's a mosh pit and then you

1084
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
and then there's a mosh pit and then you
 

1085
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,350
and then there's a mosh pit and then you
know you bump into the other galaxy uh i

1086
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
know you bump into the other galaxy uh i
 

1087
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,029
know you bump into the other galaxy uh i
think it's i think the question should

1088
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
think it's i think the question should
 

1089
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,230
think it's i think the question should
be

1090
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
be
 

1091
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,990
be
we know when else is everyone getting

1092
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
we know when else is everyone getting
 

1093
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,430
we know when else is everyone getting
here instead of where is everyone i

1094
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
here instead of where is everyone i
 

1095
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,510
here instead of where is everyone i
think i think we've just started on the

1096
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:57,520
think i think we've just started on the
 

1097
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,909
think i think we've just started on the
genesis of life in the universe yeah so

1098
00:17:59,909 --> 00:17:59,919
genesis of life in the universe yeah so
 

1099
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,950
genesis of life in the universe yeah so
not not worry have they or not more

1100
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:02,960
not not worry have they or not more
 

1101
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,789
not not worry have they or not more
about when and who

1102
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
about when and who
 

1103
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,390
about when and who
and how do we set up the party right and

1104
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:06,400
and how do we set up the party right and
 

1105
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,310
and how do we set up the party right and
then how do we help them i think it's an

1106
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
then how do we help them i think it's an
 

1107
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,510
then how do we help them i think it's an
interesting other moral question is do

1108
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
interesting other moral question is do
 

1109
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,190
interesting other moral question is do
we you know the a lot of star trek

1110
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
we you know the a lot of star trek
 

1111
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,950
we you know the a lot of star trek
episodes you the prime directive is you

1112
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
episodes you the prime directive is you
 

1113
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,789
episodes you the prime directive is you
do not interfere with another planet if

1114
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
do not interfere with another planet if
 

1115
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,950
do not interfere with another planet if
you could pass by a planet i think it's

1116
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
you could pass by a planet i think it's
 

1117
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,470
you could pass by a planet i think it's
time to also revisit that because what

1118
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
time to also revisit that because what
 

1119
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,549
time to also revisit that because what
if what if you go by a planet and we

1120
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
if what if you go by a planet and we
 

1121
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,350
if what if you go by a planet and we
think

1122
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
think
 

1123
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,190
think
that with as far as we can tell with

1124
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
that with as far as we can tell with
 

1125
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,789
that with as far as we can tell with
enough certainty that they would never

1126
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799
enough certainty that they would never
 

1127
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,350
enough certainty that they would never
be able to leave their planet and then

1128
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
be able to leave their planet and then
 

1129
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,710
be able to leave their planet and then
the sun eventually would engulf that

1130
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:28,720
the sun eventually would engulf that
 

1131
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,390
the sun eventually would engulf that
planet wherever that planet might be in

1132
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:30,400
planet wherever that planet might be in
 

1133
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,750
planet wherever that planet might be in
some solar system

1134
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
some solar system
 

1135
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,669
some solar system
but if we had a way to help them their

1136
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
but if we had a way to help them their
 

1137
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,669
but if we had a way to help them their
culture their science their technology

uh you know reaching out to other aliens

1218
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
uh you know reaching out to other aliens
 

1219
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,750
uh you know reaching out to other aliens
we've been doing reach out to aliens

1220
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
we've been doing reach out to aliens
 

1221
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,110
we've been doing reach out to aliens
since the first radio waves been

1222
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,120
since the first radio waves been
 

1223
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,470
since the first radio waves been
broadcast so we're doing some of it but

1224
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
broadcast so we're doing some of it but
 

1225
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,909
broadcast so we're doing some of it but
to do them really made it sound like

1226
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
to do them really made it sound like
 

1227
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,909
to do them really made it sound like
your lab is mostly focused on biology

1228
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
your lab is mostly focused on biology
 

1229
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,350
your lab is mostly focused on biology
but you also reach out occasionally

1230
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:05,360
but you also reach out occasionally
 

1231
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,110
but you also reach out occasionally
occasionally when they visit they have

1232
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
occasionally when they visit they have
 

1233
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,630
occasionally when they visit they have
they bring their whiskey you know we

1234
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
they bring their whiskey you know we
 

1235
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,870
they bring their whiskey you know we
have a drink but the

1236
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:10,880
have a drink but the
 

1237
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,909
have a drink but the
uh

1238
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:11,919
uh
 

1239
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,310
uh
i think we we can do we've been

1240
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
i think we we can do we've been
 

1241
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,909
i think we we can do we've been
broadcasting into space for you know at

1242
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:15,919
broadcasting into space for you know at
 

1243
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,350
broadcasting into space for you know at
this point almost a century getting

1244
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
this point almost a century getting
 

1245
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,310
this point almost a century getting
close to

1246
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
close to
 

1247
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,390
close to
and you know so but it's not been

1248
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:20,400
and you know so but it's not been
 

1249
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,830
and you know so but it's not been
structured so i think it's very cheap

1250
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:21,840
structured so i think it's very cheap
 

1251
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,830
structured so i think it's very cheap
and easy to send out structured messages

1252
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
and easy to send out structured messages
 

1253
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,750
and easy to send out structured messages
um like what carl sagan wrote about in

1254
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:25,760
um like what carl sagan wrote about in
 

1255
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,270
um like what carl sagan wrote about in
contact doing prime numbers and sending

1256
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,280
contact doing prime numbers and sending
 

1257
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,350
contact doing prime numbers and sending
those out to indicate intelligence

1258
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
those out to indicate intelligence
 

1259
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,190
those out to indicate intelligence
uh so there's things we can do that i

1260
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
uh so there's things we can do that i
 

1261
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,950
uh so there's things we can do that i
think are very cheap and very easy so we

1262
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
think are very cheap and very easy so we
 

1263
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,630
think are very cheap and very easy so we
should do some of that we can walk and

1264
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:34,640
should do some of that we can walk and
 

1265
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,710
should do some of that we can walk and
chew gum at the same time this is one of

1266
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:36,720
chew gum at the same time this is one of
 

1267
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,149
chew gum at the same time this is one of
the biggest critiques people often say

1268
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:38,159
the biggest critiques people often say
 

1269
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,909
the biggest critiques people often say
of space research and even space flight

1270
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
of space research and even space flight
 

1271
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,430
of space research and even space flight
in general is too expensive shouldn't we

1272
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
in general is too expensive shouldn't we
 

1273
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,070
in general is too expensive shouldn't we
solve poverty shouldn't we cure diseases

1274
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
solve poverty shouldn't we cure diseases
 

1275
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,909
solve poverty shouldn't we cure diseases
and the answer is always as it always

1276
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
and the answer is always as it always
 

1277
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,190
and the answer is always as it always
has been is that you can walk and chew

1278
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,200
has been is that you can walk and chew
 

1279
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,029
has been is that you can walk and chew
gum at the same time you can

1280
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
gum at the same time you can
 

1281
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,710
gum at the same time you can
pass the civil rights act and go to the

1282
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:50,720
pass the civil rights act and go to the
 

1283
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,669
pass the civil rights act and go to the
moon in the same decade you can improve

1284
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:53,679
moon in the same decade you can improve
 

1285
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,590
moon in the same decade you can improve
and and get rid of structural inequality

1286
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
and and get rid of structural inequality
 

1287
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,909
and and get rid of structural inequality
while getting to the moon and mars in

1288
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:57,919
while getting to the moon and mars in
 

1289
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,909
while getting to the moon and mars in
this decade so i think i think we can do

1290
00:20:59,909 --> 00:20:59,919
this decade so i think i think we can do
 

1291
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:00,710
this decade so i think i think we can do
both

1292
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
both
 

1293
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,390
both
yeah and they kind of help each other

1294
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:02,400
yeah and they kind of help each other
 

1295
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,990
yeah and they kind of help each other
there's sometimes criticism of like

1296
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,000
there's sometimes criticism of like
 

1297
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,990
there's sometimes criticism of like
ridiculous science like studying

1298
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,000
ridiculous science like studying
 

1299
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,070
ridiculous science like studying

it doesn't have to be you just said a

1402
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:57,679
it doesn't have to be you just said a
 

1403
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,230
it doesn't have to be you just said a
half sentence presuming it's safe that's

1404
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:00,240
half sentence presuming it's safe that's
 

1405
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,230
half sentence presuming it's safe that's
the fundamental question

1406
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
the fundamental question
 

1407
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,630
the fundamental question
so if you could yes presuming it's safe

1408
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
so if you could yes presuming it's safe
 

1409
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,630
so if you could yes presuming it's safe
so i think you know we have this uh

1410
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
so i think you know we have this uh
 

1411

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,470
temperature and more humidity then
suddenly the first settlers and mars are

1460
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
suddenly the first settlers and mars are
 

1461
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,149
suddenly the first settlers and mars are
encountering a strange new fungus or

1462
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
encountering a strange new fungus or
 

1463
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,669
encountering a strange new fungus or
something that's not even like a fungus

1464
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:53,679
something that's not even like a fungus
 

1465
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,110
something that's not even like a fungus
because it might be a different clade of

1466
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
because it might be a different clade of
 

1467
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,590
because it might be a different clade of
life a different branch of life

1468
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
life a different branch of life
 

1469
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,950
life a different branch of life
and could be very dangerous or it could

1470
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
and could be very dangerous or it could
 

1471
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,710
and could be very dangerous or it could
be very inert i mean most of life on

1472
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:00,720
be very inert i mean most of life on
 

1473
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,470
be very inert i mean most of life on
earth on earth is

1474
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:02,480
earth on earth is
 

1475
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,070
earth on earth is
not really dangerous or harmful let me

1476
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
not really dangerous or harmful let me
 

1477
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,430
not really dangerous or harmful let me
go back down this

1478
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:07,440
go back down this
 

1479
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,590
go back down this
most of life on earth is neither harmful

1480
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:09,600
most of life on earth is neither harmful
 

1481
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,190
most of life on earth is neither harmful
nor beneficial to you it's just they're

1482
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:11,200
nor beneficial to you it's just they're
 

1483
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,789
nor beneficial to you it's just they're
making its own way in the universe just

1484
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:12,799
making its own way in the universe just
 

1485
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,029
making its own way in the universe just
trying to survive it's when you know

1486
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:15,039
trying to survive it's when you know
 

1487
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,310
trying to survive it's when you know
it's inside of you and replicating

1488
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,320
it's inside of you and replicating
 

1489
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,590
it's inside of you and replicating
yourselves and destroying your cells

1490
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
yourselves and destroying your cells
 

1491
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,950
yourselves and destroying your cells
like a virus like like like covid xrcv2

1492
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
like a virus like like like covid xrcv2
 

1493
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,470
like a virus like like like covid xrcv2
that it becomes a big problem of course

1494
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
that it becomes a big problem of course
 

1495
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,710
that it becomes a big problem of course
but it's you know just doesn't really

1496
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
but it's you know just doesn't really
 

1497
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,390
but it's you know just doesn't really
have agency it's just trying to get by

1498
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:26,400
have agency it's just trying to get by
 

1499
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,990
have agency it's just trying to get by
and so for example most the bacteria on

1500
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,000
and so for example most the bacteria on
 

1501
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,350
and so for example most the bacteria on
the

1502
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
the
 

1503
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,870
the
table on your skin

1504
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:30,880
table on your skin
 

1505
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,789
table on your skin
in the subway are pretty inert they're

1506
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
in the subway are pretty inert they're
 

1507
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,590
in the subway are pretty inert they're
just

1508
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:33,600
just
 

1509
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,269
just
you know people hanging around for the

1510
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
you know people hanging around for the
 

1511
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,430
you know people hanging around for the
ride and actually

1512
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
ride and actually
 

1513
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,269
ride and actually
just because we're talking so much trash

1514
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,279
just because we're talking so much trash
 

1515
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,230
just because we're talking so much trash
about viruses most viruses are

1516
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
about viruses most viruses are
 

1517
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,909
about viruses most viruses are
don't bother humans they're phages

1518
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:43,919
don't bother humans they're phages
 

1519
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,750
don't bother humans they're phages
almost all the vast majority of viruses

1520
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:45,760
almost all the vast majority of viruses
 

1521
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,070
almost all the vast majority of viruses
are phages there's this this battle in

1522
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
are phages there's this this battle in
 

1523
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,909
are phages there's this this battle in
the biology that is really dorky is that

1524
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:49,919
the biology that is really dorky is that
 

1525
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,830
the biology that is really dorky is that
bacteria think that they're the most you

1526
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:51,840
bacteria think that they're the most you
 

1527
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,430
bacteria think that they're the most you
know people study bacteria think the

1528
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:53,440
know people study bacteria think the
 

1529
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,549
know people study bacteria think the
bacteria are the most important because

1530
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
bacteria are the most important because
 

1531
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,269
bacteria are the most important because
there's

1532
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:55,279
there's
 

1533
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,950
there's
trillions and trillions of them they run

1534
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
trillions and trillions of them they run
 

1535
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,549
trillions and trillions of them they run
a lot of our own biology in our body

1536
00:24:58,549 --> 00:24:58,559
a lot of our own biology in our body
 

1537
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,230
a lot of our own biology in our body
that but then people who study phages

1538
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,240
that but then people who study phages
 

1539
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,430
that but then people who study phages
they say well there's 10 times more

1540
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
they say well there's 10 times more
 

1541
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,190
they say well there's 10 times more
phages than the bacteria which can

1542
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,200
phages than the bacteria which can
 

1543
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,870
phages than the bacteria which can
attack the bacteria and destroy them as

1544
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
attack the bacteria and destroy them as
 

1545
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,149
attack the bacteria and destroy them as
well so

1546
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:06,159
well so
 

1547
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,269
well so
phage people think that they run the

1548
00:25:07,269 --> 00:25:07,279
phage people think that they run the
 

1549
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,070
phage people think that they run the
world

1550
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
world
 

1551
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,870
world
but

1552
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:08,880
but
 

1553
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,310
but
we need them both

1554
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
we need them both
 

1555
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,950
we need them both
uh what do you think about viruses all

1556
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:12,960
uh what do you think about viruses all
 

1557
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,110
uh what do you think about viruses all
right so because you said alien

1558
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
right so because you said alien
 

1559
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,950
right so because you said alien
organisms wouldn't we encounter

1560
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:16,960
organisms wouldn't we encounter
 

1561
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,470
organisms wouldn't we encounter
something like bacteria something like

1562
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
something like bacteria something like
 

1563
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,590
something like bacteria something like
viruses

1564
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:19,600
viruses
 

1565
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,470
viruses
as the first alien life form are they

1566
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
as the first alien life form are they
 

1567
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,710
as the first alien life form are they
first of all are viruses alive

1568
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
first of all are viruses alive
 

1569
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,230
first of all are viruses alive
or not

1570
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,240
or not
 

1571
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,710
or not
so by the book definition if you pick up

1572
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
so by the book definition if you pick up
 

1573
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,230
so by the book definition if you pick up
a biology textbook they'd say

1574
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,240
a biology textbook they'd say
 

1575
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,470
a biology textbook they'd say
technically no because they don't have

1576
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
technically no because they don't have
 

1577
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,070
technically no because they don't have
the ability to self-replicate

1578
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
the ability to self-replicate
 

1579
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,430
the ability to self-replicate
independently

1580
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:35,440
independently
 

1581
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,909
independently
but i would think if you restructure how

1582
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
but i would think if you restructure how
 

1583
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,590
but i would think if you restructure how
you view what life is it's just

1584
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
you view what life is it's just
 

1585
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,350
you view what life is it's just
autonomously

1586
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:41,360
autonomously
 

1587
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,029
autonomously
aggregating and replicating of

1588
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
aggregating and replicating of
 

1589
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,789
aggregating and replicating of
information uh

1590
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:44,799
information uh
 

1591
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,230
information uh
for example ai at some point what if

1592
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,240
for example ai at some point what if
 

1593
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,269
for example ai at some point what if
there's an ai platform that we could

1594
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:47,279
there's an ai platform that we could
 

1595
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,350
there's an ai platform that we could
consider alive like at what point would

1596
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:49,360
consider alive like at what point would
 

1597
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,190
consider alive like at what point would
you allow it to say it's alive and i

1598
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
you allow it to say it's alive and i
 

1599
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,870
you allow it to say it's alive and i
think we have the same definitional

1600
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
think we have the same definitional
 

1601
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,950
think we have the same definitional
challenge there is that if it can

1602
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960
challenge there is that if it can
 

1603
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,029
challenge there is that if it can
continually propagate instructions for

1604
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
continually propagate instructions for
 

1605
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,269
continually propagate instructions for
its own existence

1606
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
its own existence
 

1607
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,190
its own existence
then it is a version of living i think

1608
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
then it is a version of living i think
 

1609
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,269
then it is a version of living i think
you know viruses don't get that

1610
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:03,279
you know viruses don't get that
 

1611
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,950
you know viruses don't get that
category because

1612
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:04,960
category because
 

1613
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,710
category because
they can't do it on their own but they

1614
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:06,720
they can't do it on their own but they
 

1615
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,310
they can't do it on their own but they
are a version of life i'd say but

1616
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
are a version of life i'd say but
 

1617
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,630
are a version of life i'd say but
probably not alive

1618
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:10,640

know counteracting entropy but we could

00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
know counteracting entropy but we could
 

1829
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,950
know counteracting entropy but we could
actually do it in a way that would be at

00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
actually do it in a way that would be at
 

1831
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,750
actually do it in a way that would be at
a large scale and for long term

1832
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:43,760
a large scale and for long term
 

1833
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,350
a large scale and for long term
so the entropy goggles is just a way to

1834
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
so the entropy goggles is just a way to
 

1835
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,389
so the entropy goggles is just a way to

looking around everything can and will

looking around everything can and will
change and so you that but then at first

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,000
change and so you that but then at first
 

1855
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,830

it's terrifying to see that oh my gosh

1856
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:03,840
it's terrifying to see that oh my gosh
 

1857
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,990
it's terrifying to see that oh my gosh
everything will decay and go away

1858
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
everything will decay and go away
 

1859
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,029
everything will decay and go away
but then

1860
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:07,039
but then
 

1861
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,389
but then
i think it's actually liberating i think

1862

i think it's actually liberating i think

molecular oblivion which the students
 

1895

often find they kind of laugh at ah
 

1897
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,389
often find they kind of laugh at ah
because on all the charts they're 22

1898
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:44,399
because on all the charts they're 22
 

1899
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,750
because on all the charts they're 22
years old but

1900
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:45,760
years old but
 

1901
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,909
years old but
older people do not laugh as much of the

1902
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919
older people do not laugh as much of the
 

1903
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,149
older people do not laugh as much of the
thought of molecular oblivion but we're

1904
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:50,159
thought of molecular oblivion but we're
 

1905
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,830
thought of molecular oblivion but we're
all marching towards it to a large

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:51,840
all marching towards it to a large
 

1907
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,070
all marching towards it to a large
degree so this is both

1908
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:54,080
degree so this is both
 

1909
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,310
degree so this is both
a great thought experiment for the

1910
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
a great thought experiment for the
 

1911
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,470
a great thought experiment for the
environment around you so just looking

1912
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
environment around you so just looking
 

1913
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,950
environment around you so just looking
at all the objects around you

at all the objects around you

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,269
at all the objects around you
that they will

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,669
that they will

1918
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:05,679
dissipate it will disappear with time
 

1919
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,269
dissipate it will disappear with time
but then it's also

1920
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
but then it's also
 

1921
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,789
but then it's also
the thing you mentioned which is how can

00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,799
the thing you mentioned which is how can
 

1923
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,310
the thing you mentioned which is how can
i affect

1924
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
i affect
 

1925
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,750
i affect
any of the world

1926
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
any of the world
 

1927
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,190
any of the world
like uh you're one little creature

1928
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
like uh you're one little creature
 

1929
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,310
like uh you're one little creature
and

1930

and
 

1931
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,269
and
it's like uh your life is kind of

1932
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:19,279
it's like uh your life is kind of
 

1933
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,269
it's like uh your life is kind of
you get dropped into this ocean and you

1934
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
you get dropped into this ocean and you
 

1935
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,789
you get dropped into this ocean and you
make a little splash

1936
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
make a little splash
 

1937
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,310
make a little splash
and how do i make it so the splash lasts

1938
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,320
and how do i make it so the splash lasts
 

1939
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,430
and how do i make it so the splash lasts
for

1940
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,440
for
 

1941
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,750
for
uh a little bit longer because it

1942
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
uh a little bit longer because it
 

1943
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,190
uh a little bit longer because it
ultimately

1944
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
ultimately
 

1945
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,190
ultimately
will uh i mean i suppose the wave will

1946
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:33,200
will uh i mean i suppose the wave will
 

1947
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,909
will uh i mean i suppose the wave will
continue indefinitely but it'd be such a

1948
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:35,919
continue indefinitely but it'd be such a
 

1949
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,070
continue indefinitely but it'd be such a
small impact it's almost undetectable

1950
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,080
small impact it's almost undetectable
 

1951
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,070
small impact it's almost undetectable
and so how do i have that impact at all

1952
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
and so how do i have that impact at all
 

1953
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,269
and so how do i have that impact at all
on so many levels i get to experience

1954
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
on so many levels i get to experience
 

1955
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,549
on so many levels i get to experience
this

1956
00:31:46,549 --> 00:31:46,559
this
 

1957
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,269
this
as a human like um

1958
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
as a human like um
 

1959
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,909
as a human like um
i recently had had my

1960
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
i recently had had my
 

1961
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,630
i recently had had my
cold storage uh hacked

1962
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
cold storage uh hacked
 

1963
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,990
cold storage uh hacked
to where it was locked essentially it

1964
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,000
to where it was locked essentially it
 

1965
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,990
to where it was locked essentially it
wasn't hacked it was locked and so you

1966
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
wasn't hacked it was locked and so you
 

1967
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,310
wasn't hacked it was locked and so you
get to lose all your data so for example

1968
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:00,320
get to lose all your data so for example
 

1969
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,310
get to lose all your data so for example
if you lose all your data if you lose

1970
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320
if you lose all your data if you lose
 

1971
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,350
if you lose all your data if you lose
all your online presence your social

1972
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:05,360
all your online presence your social
 

1973
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,430
all your online presence your social
media your emails

1974
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
media your emails
 

1975
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,549
media your emails
if you

1976
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:08,559
if you
 

1977
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,830
if you
like think of all the things you could

1978
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:09,840
like think of all the things you could
 

1979
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,430
like think of all the things you could
lose in a fire there's been a lot of

1980
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,440
lose in a fire there's been a lot of
 

1981
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,950
lose in a fire there's been a lot of
fires in the united states if you lose

1982
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:12,960
fires in the united states if you lose
 

1983
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,470
fires in the united states if you lose
your home yeah

1984
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:14,480
your home yeah
 

1985
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,630
your home yeah
it makes you realize wait a minute

1986
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:16,640
it makes you realize wait a minute
 

1987
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,750
it makes you realize wait a minute
this is exactly a nice simulation

1988
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:19,760
this is exactly a nice simulation
 

1989
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,149
this is exactly a nice simulation
of what will happen anyway yeah

1990
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:22,159
of what will happen anyway yeah
 

1991
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,549
of what will happen anyway yeah
eventually uh and that eventually comes

1992
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
eventually uh and that eventually comes
 

1993
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,630
eventually uh and that eventually comes
pretty quickly and so you it allows you

1994
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,640
pretty quickly and so you it allows you
 

1995
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,950
pretty quickly and so you it allows you
to focus on you know how can i actually

1996
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
to focus on you know how can i actually
 

1997
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,630
to focus on you know how can i actually
affect

1998
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:30,640
affect
 

1999
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,269
affect
so what matters what lasts

2000
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
so what matters what lasts
 

2001
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,389
so what matters what lasts
um and what brings me joy i suppose that

2002
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:36,399
um and what brings me joy i suppose that
 

2003
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,630
um and what brings me joy i suppose that
the ultimate answer is nothing lasts you

2004
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:38,640
the ultimate answer is nothing lasts you
 

2005
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,630
the ultimate answer is nothing lasts you
have to focus on the things in the

2006
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
have to focus on the things in the
 

2007
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,269
have to focus on the things in the
moment that bring you joy and that have

2008
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
moment that bring you joy and that have
 

2009
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,590
moment that bring you joy and that have
a positive impact on those around you

2010
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
a positive impact on those around you
 

2011
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,350
a positive impact on those around you
that focusing on something that's long

2012
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
that focusing on something that's long
 

2013
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,029
that focusing on something that's long
lasting is perhaps

2014
00:32:51,029 --> 00:32:51,039

 

2015
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,190

i don't know it's it's complicated right

2016
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
i don't know it's it's complicated right
 

2017
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,029
i don't know it's it's complicated right
because like

2018
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
because like
 

2019
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,870
because like
well it used to be foolhardy to say i

2020
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
well it used to be foolhardy to say i
 

2021
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,630
well it used to be foolhardy to say i
want to think legacy is often what

2022
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:58,640
want to think legacy is often what
 

2023
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,909
want to think legacy is often what
people think of as they approach the end

2024
00:32:59,909 --> 00:32:59,919
people think of as they approach the end
 

2025
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,190
people think of as they approach the end
of their life what is my legacy what

2026
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
of their life what is my legacy what
 

2027
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,669
of their life what is my legacy what
have i done even younger in life but

2028
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
have i done even younger in life but
 

2029
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,350
have i done even younger in life but
it used to be really foolhardy to say i

2030
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
it used to be really foolhardy to say i
 

2031
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,789
it used to be really foolhardy to say i
could affect something that would learn

2032
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
could affect something that would learn
 

2033
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,909
could affect something that would learn
people would build the building

2034
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
people would build the building
 

2035
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,990
people would build the building
architecture i put my name on this

2036
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:10,000
architecture i put my name on this
 

2037
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,430
architecture i put my name on this
building and there i have some sense of

2038
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,440
building and there i have some sense of
 

2039
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,710
building and there i have some sense of
immortality

2040
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
immortality
 

2041
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,870
immortality
but that's a it's a fleeting dream it's

2042
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,880
but that's a it's a fleeting dream it's
 

2043
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,870
but that's a it's a fleeting dream it's
not you can't uh we're reaching

2044
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
not you can't uh we're reaching
 

2045
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,110
not you can't uh we're reaching
mortality uh and if you could it would

2046
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
mortality uh and if you could it would
 

2047
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,310
mortality uh and if you could it would
be resource

2048
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
be resource
 

2049
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,389
be resource
you know taxing on everyone else if

2050
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
you know taxing on everyone else if
 

2051
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,590
you know taxing on everyone else if
you really were

2052
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:23,600
you really were
 

2053
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,070
you really were
but i think it's it's okay i mean the

2054
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
but i think it's it's okay i mean the
 

2055
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,350
but i think it's it's okay i mean the
books for the next 500 years but i

2056
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
books for the next 500 years but i
 

2057
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,549
books for the next 500 years but i
presume i'll be dead for the vast

2058
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
presume i'll be dead for the vast
 

2059
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,190
presume i'll be dead for the vast
majority of that time and i i but that

2060
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,200
majority of that time and i i but that
 

2061
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,710
majority of that time and i i but that
is that is actually the liberating state

2062
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
is that is actually the liberating state
 

2063
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,470
is that is actually the liberating state
of mortality is you know

2064
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:34,480
of mortality is you know
 

2065
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,149
of mortality is you know
that you don't have forever so it means

2066
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
that you don't have forever so it means
 

2067
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,509
that you don't have forever so it means
what can you do that is the most

2068
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:37,519
what can you do that is the most
 

2069
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,590
what can you do that is the most
impactful but you can build things that

2070
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:39,600
impactful but you can build things that
 

2071
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,830
impactful but you can build things that
you said i want to pass this on to the

2072
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:41,840
you said i want to pass this on to the
 

2073
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,430
you said i want to pass this on to the
next generation again the most obvious

2074
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,440
next generation again the most obvious
 

2075
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,549
next generation again the most obvious
thing we do with this is if people have

2076
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:44,559
thing we do with this is if people have
 

2077
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,230
thing we do with this is if people have
kids but

2078
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:46,240
kids but
 

2079
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,750
kids but
they don't think of this as a as an

2080
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
they don't think of this as a as an
 

2081
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,269
they don't think of this as a as an
intergenerational responsibility to

2082
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:49,279
intergenerational responsibility to
 

2083
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,710
intergenerational responsibility to
think of it as well i was at the bar one

2084
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
think of it as well i was at the bar one
 

2085
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,230
think of it as well i was at the bar one
night and i met this hot girl and then

2086
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,240
night and i met this hot girl and then
 

2087
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,909
night and i met this hot girl and then
things happen or sometimes it's more

2088
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
things happen or sometimes it's more
 

2089
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,350
things happen or sometimes it's more
planned than that but the

2090
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:55,360
planned than that but the
 

2091
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,149
planned than that but the
the

2092
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:56,159
the
 

2093
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,669
the
there's no overarching sense of weight i

2094
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:57,679
there's no overarching sense of weight i
 

2095
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,269
there's no overarching sense of weight i
could have something that three or four

2096
00:33:59,269 --> 00:33:59,279
could have something that three or four
 

2097
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,950
could have something that three or four
generations from now well that someone

2098
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:00,960
generations from now well that someone
 

2099
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,310
generations from now well that someone
will receive this gift that was planned

2100
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
will receive this gift that was planned
 

2101
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,990
will receive this gift that was planned
for them long before they were born or

2102
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,000
for them long before they were born or
 

2103
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,269
for them long before they were born or
gestating

2104
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:05,279
gestating
 

2105
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,830
gestating
and i think we have that capacity and

2106
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
and i think we have that capacity and
 

2107
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,149
and i think we have that capacity and
that that can be a version of legacy but

2108
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:10,159
that that can be a version of legacy but
 

2109
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,550
that that can be a version of legacy but
it's even okay if if no one knows

2110
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
it's even okay if if no one knows
 

2111
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,990
it's even okay if if no one knows
exactly who started it but that the

2112
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,000
exactly who started it but that the
 

2113
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,550
exactly who started it but that the
benefit was was wrought by people

2114
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:16,560
benefit was was wrought by people
 

2115
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,909
benefit was was wrought by people
you know again hundreds or even

2116
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:17,919
you know again hundreds or even
 

2117
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:19,349
you know again hundreds or even
thousands of years after you start got

2118
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:19,359
thousands of years after you start got
 

2119
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,589
thousands of years after you start got
it started so i think this

2120
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:21,599
it started so i think this
 

2121
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,510
it started so i think this
is again something that is um

2122
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520
is again something that is um
 

2123
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,190
is again something that is um
only really people that are economically

2124
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:27,200
only really people that are economically
 

2125
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,190
only really people that are economically
secure can even begin to do this or you

2126
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,200
secure can even begin to do this or you
 

2127
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,550
secure can even begin to do this or you
can say you know think of maslow's

2128
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:30,560
can say you know think of maslow's
 

2129
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,149
can say you know think of maslow's
hierarchy of needs where you need to

2130
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
hierarchy of needs where you need to
 

2131
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,589
hierarchy of needs where you need to
satisfy your physical needs all your

2132
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:33,599
satisfy your physical needs all your
 

2133
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,430
satisfy your physical needs all your
structural needs and have shelter

2134
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,440
structural needs and have shelter
 

2135
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,550
structural needs and have shelter
and so you know i'm sitting from a

2136
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:36,560
and so you know i'm sitting from a
 

2137
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,909
and so you know i'm sitting from a
position of great privilege to be able

2138
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:37,919
position of great privilege to be able
 

2139
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:39,750
position of great privilege to be able
to pontificate about what i hope i could

2140
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:39,760
to pontificate about what i hope i could
 

2141
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,829
to pontificate about what i hope i could
do for things for people that come 200

2142
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
do for things for people that come 200
 

2143
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,909
do for things for people that come 200
years from now but nonetheless more and

2144
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,919
years from now but nonetheless more and
 

2145
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,310
years from now but nonetheless more and
more people can do that humanity's never

2146
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,320
more people can do that humanity's never
 

2147
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,629
more people can do that humanity's never
been in a better state quantifiably to

2148
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:48,639
been in a better state quantifiably to
 

2149
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,230
been in a better state quantifiably to
be able to start to think about these

2150
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,240
be able to start to think about these
 

2151
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,629
be able to start to think about these
intergenerational responsibilities

2152
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
intergenerational responsibilities
 

2153
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,629
intergenerational responsibilities
yeah this is a interesting balance

2154
00:34:54,629 --> 00:34:54,639
yeah this is a interesting balance
 

2155
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,349
yeah this is a interesting balance
because like it seems that

2156
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
because like it seems that
 

2157
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,589
because like it seems that
if you let the ego flare up a little bit

2158
00:34:59,589 --> 00:34:59,599
if you let the ego flare up a little bit
 

2159
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,670
if you let the ego flare up a little bit
that's good for productivity yeah like

2160
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
that's good for productivity yeah like
 

2161
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,589
that's good for productivity yeah like
saying i can somehow achieve immortality

2162
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
saying i can somehow achieve immortality
 

2163
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,990
saying i can somehow achieve immortality
if what i do is going to be pretty good

2164
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
if what i do is going to be pretty good
 

2165
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,510
if what i do is going to be pretty good
but then

2166
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:07,520
but then
 

2167
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,750
but then
that's actually being kind of

2168
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
that's actually being kind of
 

2169
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,950
that's actually being kind of
dishonest with yourself because it won't

2170
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:12,960
dishonest with yourself because it won't
 

2171
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,670
dishonest with yourself because it won't
in the long arc of history won't matter

2172
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
in the long arc of history won't matter
 

2173
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,230
in the long arc of history won't matter
right in terms of your own ego but it

2174
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,240
right in terms of your own ego but it
 

2175
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,510
right in terms of your own ego but it
will have

2176
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
will have
 

2177
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,470
will have
a small piece to play in a larger puzzle

2178
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,480
a small piece to play in a larger puzzle
 

2179
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,630
a small piece to play in a larger puzzle
and help people yeah

2180
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:24,640
and help people yeah
 

2181
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,190
and help people yeah
people many generations from now

2182
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
people many generations from now
 

2183
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,550
people many generations from now
and that they said there are all these

2184
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
and that they said there are all these
 

2185
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,230
and that they said there are all these
people who were looking after me before

2186
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:30,240
people who were looking after me before
 

2187
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,790
people who were looking after me before
i was ever born i think um

2188
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:32,800
i was ever born i think um
 

2189
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,190
i was ever born i think um
it's because it's a bit of just uh even

2190
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,200
it's because it's a bit of just uh even
 

2191
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,950
it's because it's a bit of just uh even
just know what if when you go to a

2192
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
just know what if when you go to a
 

2193
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,310
just know what if when you go to a
campsite there's a camping rule that you

2194
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:38,320
campsite there's a camping rule that you
 

2195
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,510
campsite there's a camping rule that you
always leave the campsite better than

2196
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:39,520
always leave the campsite better than
 

2197
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,870
always leave the campsite better than
you found it so

2198
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
you found it so
 

2199
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,550
you found it so
if if the fire pit was somewhat damaged

2200
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:42,560
if if the fire pit was somewhat damaged
 

2201
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,670
if if the fire pit was somewhat damaged
and you got there you fix it if there

2202
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:43,680
and you got there you fix it if there
 

2203
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,069
and you got there you fix it if there
was no wood you leave a few bits of logs

2204
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:46,079
was no wood you leave a few bits of logs
 

2205
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,990
was no wood you leave a few bits of logs
for the next person who comes and this

2206
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,000
for the next person who comes and this
 

2207
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,310
for the next person who comes and this
ethos is something that uh just picked

2208
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,320
ethos is something that uh just picked
 

2209
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,670
ethos is something that uh just picked
up from camping and so i think if we did

2210
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:51,680
up from camping and so i think if we did
 

2211
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,349
up from camping and so i think if we did
that as people the world would be a

2212
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:53,359
that as people the world would be a
 

2213
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,710
that as people the world would be a
better place and the world coming ahead

2214
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:54,720
better place and the world coming ahead
 

2215
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,510
better place and the world coming ahead
would also be

2216
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520

 

2217
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,550

that said with these entropy glasses

2218
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:00,560
that said with these entropy glasses
 

2219
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,150
that said with these entropy glasses
how can you uh see through the fog 500

2220
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,160
how can you uh see through the fog 500
 

2221
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,390
how can you uh see through the fog 500
years is a long time first of all why

2222
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
years is a long time first of all why
 

2223
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,910
years is a long time first of all why
500 years

2224
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:07,920
500 years
 

2225
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,550
500 years
most people this is so refreshing

2226
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,560
most people this is so refreshing
 

2227
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,670
most people this is so refreshing
because most colleagues and friends i

2228

to think even like 10 years out

2234
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
to think even like 10 years out
 

2235
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,670
to think even like 10 years out
they start doing wishy-washy kind of

2236
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:21,680
they start doing wishy-washy kind of
 

2237
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,829
they start doing wishy-washy kind of
statements about well you don't know but

it's so refreshing to say all right i
 

2241
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,990
it's so refreshing to say all right i
know there's so many trajectories that

2242
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,000
know there's so many trajectories that
 

2243
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,589
know there's so many trajectories that
this world can take but i'm going to

2244
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:29,599
this world can take but i'm going to
 

2245
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,790
this world can take but i'm going to
pick a few

2246
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
pick a few
 

2247
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,349
pick a few
and and think through them and think

2248

and and think through them and think
 

2249

so what why 500 years so 500 was a

2256
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:41,599
so what why 500 years so 500 was a
 

2257
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,750
so what why 500 years so 500 was a
little bit of what i felt like i could

2258
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:43,760
little bit of what i felt like i could
 

2259
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,589
little bit of what i felt like i could
see clearly through the entropy goggles

2260
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:45,599
see clearly through the entropy goggles
 

2261
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,270
see clearly through the entropy goggles
i i feel like i can't i can't just the

2262
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
i i feel like i can't i can't just the
 

2263
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,790
i i feel like i can't i can't just the
contradiction in terms

2264
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:48,800
contradiction in terms
 

2265
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,630
contradiction in terms
right i can see

2266
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,640
right i can see
 

2267
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,630
right i can see
i mean for example you said chris what's

2268
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:52,640
i mean for example you said chris what's
 

2269
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,950
i mean for example you said chris what's
going to happen in a million years well

2270
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:54,960
going to happen in a million years well
 

2271
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,550
going to happen in a million years well
i'll start to describe

2272
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,560
i'll start to describe
 

2273
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,470
i'll start to describe
you know what happens to the

2274
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
you know what happens to the
 

2275
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,069
you know what happens to the
the moon will be farther away because it

2276
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:00,079
the moon will be farther away because it
 

2277
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,150
the moon will be farther away because it
moves several inches away every year and

2278
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
moves several inches away every year and
 

2279
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,630
moves several inches away every year and
so then eventually you can't have a full

2280
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:04,640
so then eventually you can't have a full
 

2281
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,069
so then eventually you can't have a full
lunar eclipse after a while i think

2282
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,079
lunar eclipse after a while i think
 

2283
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,069
lunar eclipse after a while i think
about structures of the continental

2284
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:08,079
about structures of the continental
 

2285
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,270
about structures of the continental
change and things will move i could

2286
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:09,280
change and things will move i could
 

2287
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,710
change and things will move i could
describe some things but it starts to

2288
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
describe some things but it starts to
 

2289
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,230
describe some things but it starts to
become so

2290
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
become so
 

2291
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,150
become so
vague it's just not a useful exercise i

2292
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:14,160
vague it's just not a useful exercise i
 

2293
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,829

think if it's too far out if it's too

2294
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
think if it's too far out if it's too
 

2295
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,150
think if it's too far out if it's too
soon that's not that much different from

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
soon that's not that much different from
 

2297
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,430

what people just do with the news and

you can just make another one next week

2319
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,670
500 i actually when i was first working
on the book and thinking about type i

on the book and thinking about type i
 

2321
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,990
on the book and thinking about type i
thought well do i do a thousand or two i

thought well do i do a thousand or two i
 

2323
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,550

kept thinking about the main idea was if

00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
kept thinking about the main idea was if
 

2325
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,710
kept thinking about the main idea was if
i were to pick this up 500 years from

2326
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,720
i were to pick this up 500 years from
 

2327
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,150
i were to pick this up 500 years from
now what would it look like i changed

2328
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:48,160
now what would it look like i changed
 

2329
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,670
now what would it look like i changed
the number if i pick up a thousand years

2330
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:49,680
the number if i pick up a thousand years
 

2331
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,390
the number if i pick up a thousand years
from now

from now
 

2333
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,670
from now
or a hundred

2334
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
or a hundred
 

2335
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,349
or a hundred
and i kept trying to think of

2336
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:53,359
and i kept trying to think of
 

2337
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,109
and i kept trying to think of
what are some time frames where really

2338
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,119
what are some time frames where really
 

2339
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:57,430
what are some time frames where really
large-scale changes have happened and so

2340
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
large-scale changes have happened and so
 

2341
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,630
large-scale changes have happened and so
in some sense you could argue that

2342
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:58,640
in some sense you could argue that
 

2343
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,230
in some sense you could argue that
humans been mostly the same for about

2344
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:00,240
humans been mostly the same for about
 

2345
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,990
humans been mostly the same for about
three or four thousand years and the

2346
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:02,000
three or four thousand years and the
 

2347
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,349
three or four thousand years and the
best example is this you looked at some

2348
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
best example is this you looked at some
 

2349
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,750
best example is this you looked at some
of the homer's poems or the greek

2350
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:05,760
of the homer's poems or the greek
 

2351
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,470
of the homer's poems or the greek
tragedies uh and oedipus for example

that's just me like you read that it's

that's just me like you read that it's
 

2367
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,829
that's just me like you read that it's
astounding and in some sense soothing

astounding and in some sense soothing

like in every high school right so like
 

2377
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,670
like in every high school right so like
you know people that's why you read them

00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:40,480
reasons i chose 500 is that it's a time

but i think we need that much time to
 

2425
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,390
but i think we need that much time to
actually perfect the technology and to

actually perfect the technology and to
 

2427

is definitely on that list
and you know i think we can

and you know i think we can
 

2481
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,710

like this sense of duty is is
 

2511
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,630
like this sense of duty is is
applicable regardless of what the state

i would imagine that ai platforms that

00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
i would imagine that ai platforms that

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,950
i would imagine that ai platforms that
are really intelligent might also get a

are really intelligent might also get a
 

2519
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,390
are really intelligent might also get a
sense of this duty or i hope they would

2520
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:50,400
sense of this duty or i hope they would
 

2521
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,069

i wrote the book for them too they can

00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
i wrote the book for them too they can

humans special so

2526
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
humans special so
 

2527
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,069
humans special so
but why

2528
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:58,079
but why
 

2529
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,430
but why
nevertheless is so much of your focus

2530
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
nevertheless is so much of your focus
 

2531
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,230
nevertheless is so much of your focus
on this human meat vehicle do you think

2532
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240
on this human meat vehicle do you think
 

2533
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,030
on this human meat vehicle do you think
is it

2534
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
is it
 

2535
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,950
is it
it's essential it doesn't have to be me

2536
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
it's essential it doesn't have to be me
 

2537
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,870
it's essential it doesn't have to be me
no it definitely does not it could be

2538
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:08,880
no it definitely does not it could be
 

2539
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,109
no it definitely does not it could be
i'm hoping that the ai platforms that

2540
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,119
i'm hoping that the ai platforms that
 

2541
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,870
i'm hoping that the ai platforms that
we've built or that would become that

2542
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:12,880
we've built or that would become that
 

2543
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,950
we've built or that would become that
would start to build themselves

2544
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:14,960
would start to build themselves
 

2545
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,870
would start to build themselves
would also carry the sense of duty

2546
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
would also carry the sense of duty
 

2547
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,309
would also carry the sense of duty
because at that point they would be life

2548
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
because at that point they would be life
 

2549
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,390
because at that point they would be life
and so whichever means

2550
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,400
and so whichever means
 

2551
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,430
and so whichever means
that life

2552
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:21,440
that life
 

2553
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,750
that life
whatever form life takes it should have

2554
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
whatever form life takes it should have
 

2555
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,750
whatever form life takes it should have
this duty i think

2556
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:25,760
this duty i think
 

2557
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,150
this duty i think
will it have the lessons of genetics

2558
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:28,160
will it have the lessons of genetics

00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,670
will it have the lessons of genetics

in almost all of your cells you have a
 

2677
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,230
in almost all of your cells you have a

reason i became a geneticist is because
 

2681
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,630
reason i became a geneticist is because
the day i learned that as an embryo we

the day i learned that as an embryo we
 

2683
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,630
the day i learned that as an embryo we
started just a single cell but all the

2684
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:30,640
started just a single cell but all the
 

2685
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,470
started just a single cell but all the

00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:37,520
i was and still am endlessly fascinated
 

2691
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,069
i was and still am endlessly fascinated
by that that is extraordinary that is to

2692
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:40,079
by that that is extraordinary that is to
 

2693
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,270
by that that is extraordinary that is to
me the most beautiful thing in the

2694
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
me the most beautiful thing in the
 

2695
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,950
me the most beautiful thing in the
entire universe that is

2696
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
entire universe that is
 

2697
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,950
entire universe that is
a completely from one single embryo

2698
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:44,960
a completely from one single embryo
 

2699
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,230
a completely from one single embryo
everything is there to make the entire

2700
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:46,240
everything is there to make the entire
 

2701
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,990
everything is there to make the entire
body which aspect of that is most

2702
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,000
body which aspect of that is most
 

2703
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,589
body which aspect of that is most
beautiful so is it

2704
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
beautiful so is it
 

2705
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,710
beautiful so is it
that there's this information within dna

2706
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
that there's this information within dna
 

2707
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,109
that there's this information within dna
that's stored efficiently

2708
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
that's stored efficiently
 

2709
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,670
that's stored efficiently
and it also stores information on how to

2710
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
and it also stores information on how to
 

2711
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,510
and it also stores information on how to
build not just what to build

2712
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
build not just what to build
 

2713
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,790
build not just what to build
yeah and so from all of that is what's

2714
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:02,800
yeah and so from all of that is what's
 

2715
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,230
yeah and so from all of that is what's
what's the sexiest what's the most

2716
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,240
what's the sexiest what's the most
 

2717
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,150
what's the sexiest what's the most
beautiful aspect is it the entire

2718
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:06,160
beautiful aspect is it the entire
 

2719
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,470
beautiful aspect is it the entire
machinery or is it just the information

2720
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:08,480
machinery or is it just the information
 

2721
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,150
machinery or is it just the information
is there

2722
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:10,160
is there
 

2723
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,550
is there
it's the fact that the machinery is the

2724
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:12,560
it's the fact that the machinery is the
 

2725
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,710
it's the fact that the machinery is the
information like that they basically it

2726
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:14,720
information like that they basically it
 

2727
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,109
information like that they basically it
becomes its own manufacturer

2728
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:17,119
becomes its own manufacturer
 

2729
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,109
becomes its own manufacturer
is is what is extraordinary imagine if

2730
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
is is what is extraordinary imagine if
 

2731
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,109
is is what is extraordinary imagine if
you if you took a one two by four and

2732
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:21,119
you if you took a one two by four and
 

2733
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,390
you if you took a one two by four and
you threw it on the ground and you said

2734
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:22,400
you threw it on the ground and you said
 

2735
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,589
you threw it on the ground and you said
i'll be back in a day and then a whole

2736
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
i'll be back in a day and then a whole
 

2737
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,349
i'll be back in a day and then a whole
house was made when you came back i mean

2738
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:25,359
house was made when you came back i mean
 

2739
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,790
house was made when you came back i mean
we would all lose our minds a lot of

2740
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:26,800
we would all lose our minds a lot of
 

2741
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,750
we would all lose our minds a lot of
people would poop their pants people

2742
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:27,760
people would poop their pants people
 

2743
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,870
people would poop their pants people
would have to wear adult diapers it

2744
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:28,880
would have to wear adult diapers it
 

2745
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,470
would have to wear adult diapers it
would be a big scene yes if that

2746
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:30,480
would be a big scene yes if that
 

2747
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,390
would be a big scene yes if that
happened um and then we're not we're

2748
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:32,400
happened um and then we're not we're
 

2749
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,510
happened um and then we're not we're
actually getting close to that people

2750
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:33,520
actually getting close to that people
 

2751
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,270
actually getting close to that people
having autonomous house building it's

2752
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
having autonomous house building it's
 

2753
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,710
having autonomous house building it's
not quite there yet but there are people

2754
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
not quite there yet but there are people
 

2755
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,750
not quite there yet but there are people
trying to make

2756
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
trying to make
 

2757
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,670
trying to make
uh robots that will build entire houses

2758
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:39,680
uh robots that will build entire houses
 

2759
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,270
uh robots that will build entire houses
but you need much more than the block of

2760
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,280
but you need much more than the block of
 

2761
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,710
but you need much more than the block of
wood right right that's that's the

2762
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
wood right right that's that's the
 

2763
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,390
wood right right that's that's the
extraordinary thing is just one one

2764
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,400
extraordinary thing is just one one
 

2765
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,589
extraordinary thing is just one one
piece of wood there and say i'll just

2766
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:45,599
piece of wood there and say i'll just
 

2767
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:46,870
piece of wood there and say i'll just
leave it there for a few days and i'll

2768
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:46,880
leave it there for a few days and i'll
 

2769
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,630
leave it there for a few days and i'll
come back that's basically what embryos

2770
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:48,640
come back that's basically what embryos
 

2771
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,829
come back that's basically what embryos
do okay it takes nine months a little

2772
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:49,839
do okay it takes nine months a little
 

2773
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,270
do okay it takes nine months a little
bit longer but still

2774
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:51,280
bit longer but still
 

2775
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,589
bit longer but still
that is nothing short of magic right so

2776
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:53,599
that is nothing short of magic right so
 

2777
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:54,550
that is nothing short of magic right so
i think

2778
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:54,560
i think
 

2779
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,829
i think
that's what i

2780
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:55,839
that's what i
 

2781
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,270
that's what i
love about you know the fact that dna

2782
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,280
love about you know the fact that dna
 

2783
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,470
love about you know the fact that dna
carries that information now the

2784
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,480
carries that information now the
 

2785
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,510
carries that information now the
information

2786
00:44:59,510 --> 00:44:59,520
information
 

2787
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,430
information
is static so to actually read that

2788
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:01,440
is static so to actually read that
 

2789
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,109
is static so to actually read that
information and to actually put into

2790
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:03,119
information and to actually put into
 

2791
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,349
information and to actually put into
motion is where rna comes in so this

2792
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:05,359
motion is where rna comes in so this
 

2793
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,589
motion is where rna comes in so this
ribonucleic acid so it just has one

2794
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:07,599
ribonucleic acid so it just has one
 

2795
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,349
ribonucleic acid so it just has one
other oxygen added to it

2796
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
other oxygen added to it
 

2797
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,190
other oxygen added to it
versus dna but it is the transcribed

2798
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:11,200
versus dna but it is the transcribed
 

2799
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,190
versus dna but it is the transcribed
version it's like if you look at a book

2800
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,200
version it's like if you look at a book
 

2801
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,470
version it's like if you look at a book
and you say you can have it in your

2802
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
and you say you can have it in your
 

2803
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,829
and you say you can have it in your
hands but then you start to read it

2804
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
hands but then you start to read it
 

2805
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,150
hands but then you start to read it
aloud it becomes the active form of the

2806
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:18,160
aloud it becomes the active form of the
 

2807
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,550
aloud it becomes the active form of the
recipe for life is the rna and those

2808
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,560
recipe for life is the rna and those
 

2809
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,550
recipe for life is the rna and those
rnas also then get

2810
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
rnas also then get
 

2811
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,990
rnas also then get
translated to become proteins that

2812
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:24,000
translated to become proteins that
 

2813
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,150
translated to become proteins that
become active forms like enzymes you

2814
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:26,160
become active forms like enzymes you
 

2815
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,230
become active forms like enzymes you
think of like your hair or think of

2816
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:28,240
think of like your hair or think of
 

2817
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,670
think of like your hair or think of
other ways you digest food there's all

2818
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:29,680
other ways you digest food there's all
 

2819
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,510
other ways you digest food there's all
these you know active proteins going

2820
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:31,520
these you know active proteins going
 

2821
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,910
these you know active proteins going
around that are copying your dna making

2822
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:33,920
around that are copying your dna making
 

2823
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,470
around that are copying your dna making
rna making sure your dna is safe there's

2824
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
rna making sure your dna is safe there's
 

2825
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,630
rna making sure your dna is safe there's
all these built-in systems to keep your

2826
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:38,640
all these built-in systems to keep your
 

2827
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,030
all these built-in systems to keep your
cells in check and working and these are

2828
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,040
cells in check and working and these are
 

2829
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,870
cells in check and working and these are
often in protein form

2830
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:42,880
often in protein form
 

2831
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,390
often in protein form
and so genes are the really these

2832
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
and so genes are the really these
 

2833
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,750
and so genes are the really these
constructs basically what are the

2834
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
constructs basically what are the
 

2835
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,829
constructs basically what are the
instruction sets like how many versions

2836
00:45:49,829 --> 00:45:49,839
instruction sets like how many versions
 

2837
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,349
instruction sets like how many versions
of instructions do you have in your

2838
00:45:51,349 --> 00:45:51,359
of instructions do you have in your
 

2839
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,430
of instructions do you have in your
genome so the genome is the collection

2840
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:53,440
genome so the genome is the collection
 

2841
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,349
genome so the genome is the collection
of all the dna of a person for humans

2842
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
of all the dna of a person for humans
 

2843
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,270
of all the dna of a person for humans
about three billion letters of genetic

2844
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:57,280
about three billion letters of genetic
 

2845
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,270
about three billion letters of genetic
code so just three billion acs g's and

2846
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
code so just three billion acs g's and
 

2847
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,349
code so just three billion acs g's and
t's these nucleotides that are the

2848
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:01,359
t's these nucleotides that are the
 

2849
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,349
t's these nucleotides that are the
recipe for life and that's it that is

2850
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:03,359
recipe for life and that's it that is
 

2851
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,030
recipe for life and that's it that is
the entire instruction set to go from

2852
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:05,040
the entire instruction set to go from
 

2853
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,430
the entire instruction set to go from
that one embryo up to a full human which

2854
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
that one embryo up to a full human which
 

2855
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,630
that one embryo up to a full human which
is pretty efficient if you say it's

2856
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,640
is pretty efficient if you say it's
 

2857
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,309
is pretty efficient if you say it's
that's actually not that that much

2858
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
that's actually not that that much
 

2859
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,150
that's actually not that that much
information and in that three billion

2860
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,160
information and in that three billion
 

2861
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,470
information and in that three billion
letters are snippets of the genes which

2862
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,480
letters are snippets of the genes which
 

2863
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,950
letters are snippets of the genes which
are independently regulated

2864
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:16,960
are independently regulated
 

2865
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,870
are independently regulated
autonomous instruction sets if you will

2866
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:18,880
autonomous instruction sets if you will
 

2867
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,990
autonomous instruction sets if you will
these really active forms of of the

2868
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,000
these really active forms of of the
 

2869
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,309
these really active forms of of the
instructions from your dna to say make a

2870
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
instructions from your dna to say make a
 

2871
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:27,349
instructions from your dna to say make a
protein make this rna or turn off some

2872
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
protein make this rna or turn off some
 

2873
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,630
protein make this rna or turn off some
other part of a cell all those

2874
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:28,640
other part of a cell all those
 

2875
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,349
other part of a cell all those
instructions are there in our dna and

2876
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:31,359
instructions are there in our dna and
 

2877
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:33,430
instructions are there in our dna and
there's about 60 000 of these genes that

2878
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:33,440
there's about 60 000 of these genes that
 

2879
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,349
there's about 60 000 of these genes that
are in our genome so how do those all

2880
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:35,359
are in our genome so how do those all
 

2881
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,670
are in our genome so how do those all
lead up to you

2882
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:37,680
lead up to you
 

2883
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,750
lead up to you
having a personality

2884
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
having a personality
 

2885
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,390
having a personality
good memory and bad memory some of the

2886
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:42,400
good memory and bad memory some of the
 

2887
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,309
good memory and bad memory some of the
functional characteristics that we at

2888
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:44,319
functional characteristics that we at
 

2889
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,550
functional characteristics that we at
the human level are able to interpret

2890
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
the human level are able to interpret
 

2891
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,349
the human level are able to interpret
the

2892
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359
the
 

2893
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,270
the
the the way your face look the way you

2894
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:49,280
the the way your face look the way you
 

2895
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,470
the the way your face look the way you
smile

2896
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:52,480

 

2897
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,309

you're good at running or jumping

2898
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:54,319
you're good at running or jumping
 

2899
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,829
you're good at running or jumping
whether you're good at math and all

2900
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:55,839
whether you're good at math and all
 

2901
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,190
whether you're good at math and all
those kinds of things there's the

2902
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
those kinds of things there's the
 

2903
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,030
those kinds of things there's the
age-old debate of nature versus nurture

2904
00:46:59,030 --> 00:46:59,040
age-old debate of nature versus nurture
 

2905
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,190
age-old debate of nature versus nurture
so like most things if given two options

2906
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
so like most things if given two options
 

2907
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,950
so like most things if given two options
you can of course have both so almost

2908
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:02,960
you can of course have both so almost
 

2909
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,230
you can of course have both so almost
every trait

2910
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,240
every trait
 

2911
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,309
every trait
that we know of in humanity has mixtures

2912
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:06,319
that we know of in humanity has mixtures
 

2913
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,550
that we know of in humanity has mixtures
of nurture and nature some of them are

2914
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:08,560
of nurture and nature some of them are
 

2915
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,550
of nurture and nature some of them are
purely nurture so there's most people

2916
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:10,560
purely nurture so there's most people
 

2917
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,750
purely nurture so there's most people
probably familiar with twin studies but

2918
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
probably familiar with twin studies but
 

2919
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,109
probably familiar with twin studies but
twin cities are one of the best ways to

2920
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:13,119
twin cities are one of the best ways to
 

2921
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,030
twin cities are one of the best ways to
gauge how much is something nurture

2922
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
gauge how much is something nurture
 

2923
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,190
gauge how much is something nurture
versus nature how much of it is really

2924
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:17,200
versus nature how much of it is really
 

2925
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,430
versus nature how much of it is really
ingrained and has probably less ability

2926
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:19,440
ingrained and has probably less ability
 

2927
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,870
ingrained and has probably less ability
to change versus how much can you really

2928
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
to change versus how much can you really
 

2929
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,309
to change versus how much can you really
train so

2930
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
train so
 

2931
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,150
train so
height for example is one of the most uh

2932
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:24,160
height for example is one of the most uh
 

2933
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,990
height for example is one of the most uh
obvious inheritable traits but it

2934
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,000
obvious inheritable traits but it
 

2935
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,750
obvious inheritable traits but it
doesn't have one gene it probably has at

2936
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:27,760
doesn't have one gene it probably has at
 

2937
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,990
doesn't have one gene it probably has at
least 50 or 60 genes that contribute to

2938
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,000
least 50 or 60 genes that contribute to
 

2939
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,309
least 50 or 60 genes that contribute to
height so it's not like a gene for

2940
00:47:32,309 --> 00:47:32,319
height so it's not like a gene for
 

2941
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:33,109
height so it's not like a gene for

some people think of like the gene for

2944
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:34,559
some people think of like the gene for
 

2945
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,230
some people think of like the gene for
cystic fibrosis now that's in that case

2946
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,240
cystic fibrosis now that's in that case
 

2947
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,069
cystic fibrosis now that's in that case
that's true there is one gene that if

00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:38,079
that's true there is one gene that if
 

2949
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,349
that's true there is one gene that if

2953
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,710

00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:42,720
other traits they're much more
 

2955
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,630
other traits they're much more
complicated they can have dozens or even

studies you take monozygotic twins twins

2962
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:50,720
studies you take monozygotic twins twins
 

2963
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,630
studies you take monozygotic twins twins
that are identical and you can clearly

00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:52,640
that are identical and you can clearly
 

2965
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,829
that are identical and you can clearly
tell they look they have the same facial

even likes and you compare them to

2970
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,160
even likes and you compare them to
 

2971
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,910
even likes and you compare them to
dizygotic twins or when you have

2972
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
dizygotic twins or when you have
 

2973
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,349
dizygotic twins or when you have
fraternal twins you can have a male and

2974
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:01,359
fraternal twins you can have a male and
 

2975
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,109
fraternal twins you can have a male and
female for example in the same uterus

2976
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
female for example in the same uterus
 

2977
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,030
female for example in the same uterus
and those are you know dizygotic twins

2978
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
and those are you know dizygotic twins
 

2979
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,670
and those are you know dizygotic twins
are two zygotes so in that case they're

2980
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
are two zygotes so in that case they're
 

2981
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,270
are two zygotes so in that case they're
they share 50 of their dna but they

2982
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
they share 50 of their dna but they
 

2983
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,270
they share 50 of their dna but they
shared the same womb and that and then

2984
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:11,280
shared the same womb and that and then
 

2985
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,630
shared the same womb and that and then
what you can look at is they you know

2986
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:12,640
what you can look at is they you know
 

2987
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,750
what you can look at is they you know
what's the difference between identical

2988
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
what's the difference between identical
 

2989
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,990
what's the difference between identical
twins versus uh fraternal twins and

2990
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,000
twins versus uh fraternal twins and
 

2991
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,829
twins versus uh fraternal twins and
calculate that difference for any trait

2992
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:17,839
calculate that difference for any trait
 

2993
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:19,190
calculate that difference for any trait
and that gives you an estimate of the

2994
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
and that gives you an estimate of the
 

2995
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,589
and that gives you an estimate of the
heritability or what's called h squared

2996
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:21,599
heritability or what's called h squared
 

2997
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,190
heritability or what's called h squared
so that's what we've been doing for

2998
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:23,200
so that's what we've been doing for
 

2999
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,630
so that's what we've been doing for
almost every trait in humanity for the

3000
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640
almost every trait in humanity for the
 

3001
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,230
almost every trait in humanity for the
past you know 100 years i've been trying

3002
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:26,240
past you know 100 years i've been trying
 

3003
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,990
past you know 100 years i've been trying
to measure this and religion is one

3004
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:28,000
to measure this and religion is one
 

3005
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,190
to measure this and religion is one
that's a negative control so if you

3006
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
that's a negative control so if you
 

3007
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,710
that's a negative control so if you
separate people and see what religion

3008
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
separate people and see what religion
 

3009
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,790
separate people and see what religion
they become there's no gene for religion

3010
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:32,800
they become there's no gene for religion
 

3011
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,870
they become there's no gene for religion
or what religion you choose so that

3012
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:34,880
or what religion you choose so that
 

3013
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,190
or what religion you choose so that
often is their correlation there is zero

3014
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:37,200
often is their correlation there is zero
 

3015
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,630
often is their correlation there is zero
because it should be it's a nurture

3016
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
because it should be it's a nurture
 

3017
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,430
because it should be it's a nurture
trait of what religion you end up taking

3018
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:41,440
trait of what religion you end up taking
 

3019
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,910
trait of what religion you end up taking
is not encoded in your dna

3020
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920

00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:48,069
religion meaning
islam judaism christianity but there

could be aspects of religions there is a
 

3027
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,030
could be aspects of religions there is a
good good question there is religiosity

favorite papers just looked at how

3040
00:49:02,549 --> 00:49:02,559
favorite papers just looked at how
 

3041
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,230
favorite papers just looked at how
likely is it that people get bored and

3043
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:04,870
likely is it that people get bored and

identical twins and fraternal twins and
 

3047
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,790
identical twins and fraternal twins and
there's a heritability about 30 so it's

3048
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:08,800
there's a heritability about 30 so it's
 

3049
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,390
there's a heritability about 30 so it's
not it's mostly not heritable it's like

3050
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:10,400
not it's mostly not heritable it's like
 

3051
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,230
not it's mostly not heritable it's like
mostly environmental but that means to

mostly environmental but that means to
 

3053
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,230
mostly environmental but that means to
some degree whether or not you're bored

3054
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:14,240
some degree whether or not you're bored
 

3055
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,910
some degree whether or not you're bored
you can say well it's a little bit of my

00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:18,240
genes you could a little bit not a lot
 

3059
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,309
genes you could a little bit not a lot
but you know most of some degree and

3060
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:20,319
but you know most of some degree and
 

3061
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,670
but you know most of some degree and
they're probably overlapping with other

we learned that spaces is rough on the
 

3097
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,950
we learned that spaces is rough on the

human body but
 

3099
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,190
human body but
that the human body is um

3100
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200
that the human body is um

body after about a year in space so it

3156
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:50,559
body after about a year in space so it
 

3157
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,870
body after about a year in space so it
was the first study of this kind

3158
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
was the first study of this kind
 

3159
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,270
was the first study of this kind
and what we found is when he got back

3160
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:55,280
and what we found is when he got back
 

3161
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,589
and what we found is when he got back
you know we saw all the same markers of

00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:57,599
you know we saw all the same markers of
 

3163
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:00,230
you know we saw all the same markers of
stress on the body and changes spiked up

3164
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
stress on the body and changes spiked up
 

3165
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,750

and really even the weight of clothing
 

3181
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,549
and really even the weight of clothing
on his skin was too heavy it created all

00:51:16,549 --> 00:51:16,559
on his skin was too heavy it created all
 

3183
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,549
on his skin was too heavy it created all
this irritation because his body had not

this irritation because his body had not
felt the weight of just a simple t-shirt

3187
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,549
felt the weight of just a simple t-shirt
it was it wasn't really had zero weight

3188
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
it was it wasn't really had zero weight
 

3189
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,470
it was it wasn't really had zero weight
of course right so and up in space

00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
of course right so and up in space
 

3191
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,150
of course right so and up in space
so that led to all this inflammation all

3192
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:26,160
so that led to all this inflammation all
 

3193

00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,190
these changes he had to you know
it was much more comfortable just to

00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,030
it was much more comfortable just to
walk around nude in that case it was for

a medical reason some people do this you

3200
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:32,480
a medical reason some people do this you
 

3201
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,910
a medical reason some people do this you
know recreationally he was doing it for

3202
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:33,920
know recreationally he was doing it for
 

3203
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,670
know recreationally he was doing it for
medical purposes i do it for medical i

3204
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:35,680
medical purposes i do it for medical i
 

3205
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,030
medical purposes i do it for medical i
mean as well

3206
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:37,040
mean as well
 

3207
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,870
mean as well
all the time i mean people say a

3208
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:38,880
all the time i mean people say a
 

3209
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,510
all the time i mean people say a
prescription since the doctor told me

3210
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
prescription since the doctor told me
 

3211
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,670
prescription since the doctor told me
so he was allergic to earth yeah very

3212
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
so he was allergic to earth yeah very
 

3213
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,589
so he was allergic to earth yeah very
fascinating to think about actually how

3214
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:45,599
fascinating to think about actually how
 

3215
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,750
fascinating to think about actually how
quick did his body adapt there so there

3216
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
quick did his body adapt there so there
 

3217
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,589
quick did his body adapt there so there
was about three to four days he got back

3218
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
was about three to four days he got back
 

3219
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,950
was about three to four days he got back
to normal at least in terms of the

3220
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
to normal at least in terms of the
 

3221
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,030
to normal at least in terms of the
inflammation but what's extraordinary is

3222
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
inflammation but what's extraordinary is
 

3223
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,829
inflammation but what's extraordinary is
that

3224
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
that
 

3225
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:56,230
that
we've measured a lot of other molecules

3226
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:56,240
we've measured a lot of other molecules
 

3227
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,589
we've measured a lot of other molecules
genes

3228
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
genes
 

3229
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,190

00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:03,280
him even six months after the mission a
 

3235
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,470
him even six months after the mission a
lot of the genes that had become

00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
lot of the genes that had become
 

3237
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,549
lot of the genes that had become
activated in response to space flight

3238
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:06,559
activated in response to space flight
 

3239
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,790
activated in response to space flight
were still active so things like we

3240
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:08,800
were still active so things like we
 

3241
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,190
were still active so things like we
could see his body repairing dna he was

3242
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:11,200
could see his body repairing dna he was
 

3243
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,109
could see his body repairing dna he was
being irradiated by cosmic rays and by

3244
00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:13,119
being irradiated by cosmic rays and by
 

3245
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:14,710
being irradiated by cosmic rays and by
the radiation it's the equivalent of

3246
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:14,720
the radiation it's the equivalent of
 

3247
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,630
the radiation it's the equivalent of
giving like three or four chest x-rays

3248
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:16,640
giving like three or four chest x-rays
 

3249
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,670
giving like three or four chest x-rays
every day just in space and we could see

3250
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:19,680
every day just in space and we could see
 

3251
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,430
every day just in space and we could see
his body working hard at the molecular

3252
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:21,440
his body working hard at the molecular
 

3253
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,430
his body working hard at the molecular
level to repair itself and even in his

3254
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:23,440
level to repair itself and even in his
 

3255
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,270
level to repair itself and even in his
urine we could see bits of what's called

3256
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,280
urine we could see bits of what's called
 

3257
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,109
urine we could see bits of what's called
eight-oxley guanosine there's a form of

3258
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,119
eight-oxley guanosine there's a form of
 

3259
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,630
eight-oxley guanosine there's a form of
damaged dna that you could see coming

3260
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:28,640
damaged dna that you could see coming
 

3261
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,349
damaged dna that you could see coming
out

3262
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:29,359
out
 

3263
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:30,549
out
and we see it for other astronauts as

3264
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
and we see it for other astronauts as
 

3265
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,910
and we see it for other astronauts as
well so it's very common you can see

3266
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:31,920
well so it's very common you can see
 

3267
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,829
well so it's very common you can see
damaged dna the response of the body to

3268
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:33,839
damaged dna the response of the body to
 

3269
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,910
damaged dna the response of the body to
repair the dna but even though he'd been

3270
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
repair the dna but even though he'd been
 

3271
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,109
repair the dna but even though he'd been
back on earth for six months that was

3272
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
back on earth for six months that was
 

3273
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,390
back on earth for six months that was
still happening uh even six months later

3274
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400
still happening uh even six months later
 

3275
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,470
still happening uh even six months later
wait how do you explain that so some of

3276
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
wait how do you explain that so some of
 

3277
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,470
wait how do you explain that so some of
this has to do with when you have a gene

3278
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,480
this has to do with when you have a gene
 

3279
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,150
this has to do with when you have a gene
get activated you might think oh it's

3280
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:46,160
get activated you might think oh it's
 

3281
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,589
get activated you might think oh it's
like a light switch i'll look at my wall

3282
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:47,599
like a light switch i'll look at my wall
 

3283
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,589
like a light switch i'll look at my wall
just flip a light on or off and

3284
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:49,599
just flip a light on or off and
 

3285
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,510
just flip a light on or off and
sometimes turning a gene on or off is

3286
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:51,520
sometimes turning a gene on or off is
 

3287
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,950
sometimes turning a gene on or off is
that simple sometimes you just flip it

3288
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:52,960
that simple sometimes you just flip it
 

3289
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,390
that simple sometimes you just flip it
on because the gene is already ready to

3290
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:54,400
on because the gene is already ready to
 

3291
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,270
on because the gene is already ready to
go

3292
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:55,280
go
 

3293
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,950
go
other cases though you have to reprogram

3294
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:56,960
other cases though you have to reprogram
 

3295
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,030
other cases though you have to reprogram
even the structure of how your dna is

3296
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,040
even the structure of how your dna is
 

3297
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,309
even the structure of how your dna is
packaged yeah which is called an

3298
00:53:00,309 --> 00:53:00,319
packaged yeah which is called an
 

3299
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,549
packaged yeah which is called an
epigenetic rearrangement in that case we

3300
00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:02,559
epigenetic rearrangement in that case we
 

3301
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,670
epigenetic rearrangement in that case we
could see in is that a lot of these

3302
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:03,680
could see in is that a lot of these
 

3303
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,910
could see in is that a lot of these
genes had been in these his cells had

3304
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:05,920
genes had been in these his cells had
 

3305
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,430
genes had been in these his cells had
changed the structure of how dna was

3306
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,440
changed the structure of how dna was
 

3307
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,670
changed the structure of how dna was
packaged and it remained open even

3308
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
packaged and it remained open even
 

3309
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,510
packaged and it remained open even
months after the mission now after about

3310
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:11,520
months after the mission now after about
 

3311
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,870
months after the mission now after about
a year it was actually almost all back

3312
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880
a year it was actually almost all back
 

3313
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,790
a year it was actually almost all back
to normal 99 of all the genes were back

3314
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
to normal 99 of all the genes were back
 

3315
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,710
to normal 99 of all the genes were back
to where they were in pre-flight levels

3316
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
to where they were in pre-flight levels
 

3317
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:17,990
to where they were in pre-flight levels
so it means that you know eventually

3318
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
so it means that you know eventually
 

3319
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,230
so it means that you know eventually
you'll adapt but there there's almost a

3320
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
you'll adapt but there there's almost a
 

3321
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,990
you'll adapt but there there's almost a
a lag time kind of like jet lag for the

3322
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,000
a lag time kind of like jet lag for the
 

3323
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,750
a lag time kind of like jet lag for the
body but jet lag for your cells to

3324
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:23,760
body but jet lag for your cells to
 

3325
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,430
body but jet lag for your cells to
repair all the dna what was the most

3326
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:25,440
repair all the dna what was the most
 

3327
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,030
repair all the dna what was the most
surprising

3328
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,040
surprising
 

3329
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,430
surprising
the thing that you found in that study

3330
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:29,440
the thing that you found in that study
 

3331
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,950
the thing that you found in that study
there are several surprises one is just

3332
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960
there are several surprises one is just
 

3333
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,390
there are several surprises one is just
that he

3334
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,400
that he
 

3335
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,829
that he
that the rep as i just mentioned that

3336
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:33,839
that the rep as i just mentioned that
 

3337
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:35,349
that the rep as i just mentioned that
the repair took so long i thought maybe

3338
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:35,359
the repair took so long i thought maybe
 

3339
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,870
the repair took so long i thought maybe
a week or a few days he'll be back to

3340
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:36,880
a week or a few days he'll be back to
 

3341
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,150
a week or a few days he'll be back to
normal but to see this molecular echo in

3342
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,160
normal but to see this molecular echo in
 

3343
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,670
normal but to see this molecular echo in
his cells of his time in space still

3344
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:41,680
his cells of his time in space still
 

3345
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,750
his cells of his time in space still
occurring was interesting this telomeres

3346
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:43,760
occurring was interesting this telomeres
 

3347
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,670
occurring was interesting this telomeres
was one was really surprising the the

3348
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
was one was really surprising the the
 

3349
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,190
was one was really surprising the the
caps and the ends of your chromosomes

3350
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,200
caps and the ends of your chromosomes
 

3351
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,270
caps and the ends of your chromosomes
which keep all your dna packaged and you

3352
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:49,280
which keep all your dna packaged and you
 

3353
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,470
which keep all your dna packaged and you
get half your chromosomes from your

3354
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
get half your chromosomes from your
 

3355
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,670
get half your chromosomes from your
mother and half from your father and

3356
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
mother and half from your father and
 

3357
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,589
mother and half from your father and
then you go on and make all your cells

3358
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,599
then you go on and make all your cells
 

3359
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:55,430
then you go on and make all your cells
normally these shrink as you get older

3360
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:55,440
normally these shrink as you get older
 

3361
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,630
normally these shrink as you get older
and telomeres

3362
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:56,640
and telomeres
 

3363
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,710
and telomeres
length is just an overall sign of aging

3364
00:53:58,710 --> 00:53:58,720
length is just an overall sign of aging
 

3365
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,870
length is just an overall sign of aging
getting shorter his telomeres got longer

3366
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:00,880
getting shorter his telomeres got longer
 

3367
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,990
getting shorter his telomeres got longer
in space

3368
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:02,000
in space
 

3369
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,190
in space
and so this is really surprising because

3370
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:03,200
and so this is really surprising because
 

3371
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,950
and so this is really surprising because
we thought the opposite would happen so

3372
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:04,960
we thought the opposite would happen so
 

3373
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,950
we thought the opposite would happen so
he that was genetically once surprised

3374
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:06,960
he that was genetically once surprised
 

3375
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,790
he that was genetically once surprised
and also some of the mutations we found

3376
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
and also some of the mutations we found
 

3377
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,270
and also some of the mutations we found
in his blood he had less mutations as if

3378
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:11,280
in his blood he had less mutations as if
 

3379
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,270
in his blood he had less mutations as if
his body was almost being like a low

3380
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,280
his body was almost being like a low
 

3381
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,950
his body was almost being like a low
dose of radiation was sort of cleansing

3382
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:14,960
dose of radiation was sort of cleansing
 

3383
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,309
dose of radiation was sort of cleansing
his body of maybe the cells that were

3384
00:54:16,309 --> 00:54:16,319
his body of maybe the cells that were
 

3385
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,549
his body of maybe the cells that were
about to die is one of our main theories

3386
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:18,559
about to die is one of our main theories
 

3387
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,470
about to die is one of our main theories
on what's happening and of course you

3388
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:20,480
on what's happening and of course you
 

3389
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,549
on what's happening and of course you
can't really you have theories but you

3390
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:22,559
can't really you have theories but you
 

3391
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,430
can't really you have theories but you
can't

3392
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:23,440
can't
 

3393
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,710
can't
because

3394
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
because
 

3395
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,470
because
the number of subjects in the study is

3396
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:26,480
the number of subjects in the study is
 

3397
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:28,710
the number of subjects in the study is
small right it's the it's notoriously

3398
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:28,720
small right it's the it's notoriously
 

3399
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,069
small right it's the it's notoriously
one of the lowest powered studies in

3400
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:30,079
one of the lowest powered studies in
 

3401
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,470
one of the lowest powered studies in
human history yes but but but what you

3402
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:32,480
human history yes but but but what you
 

3403
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,470
human history yes but but but what you
will you lack in subjects you can make

3404
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:34,480
will you lack in subjects you can make
 

3405
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,910
will you lack in subjects you can make
up for in the number of sampling times

3406
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:35,920
up for in the number of sampling times
 

3407
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,630
up for in the number of sampling times
so we did basically 260 samples

3408
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
so we did basically 260 samples
 

3409
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,069
so we did basically 260 samples
collected over the course of three years

3410
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:40,079
collected over the course of three years
 

3411
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,470
collected over the course of three years
so we really almost every few weeks had

3412
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
so we really almost every few weeks had
 

3413
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,750
so we really almost every few weeks had
a full workup uh including in space so

3414
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:45,760
a full workup uh including in space so
 

3415
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,950
a full workup uh including in space so
that was the way we tried to make up for

3416
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:46,960
that was the way we tried to make up for
 

3417
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,630
that was the way we tried to make up for
it but but we've tried another model

3418
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:48,640
it but but we've tried another model
 

3419
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,990
it but but we've tried another model
organisms in mice we've seen this we've

3420
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,000
organisms in mice we've seen this we've
 

3421
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,470
organisms in mice we've seen this we've
looked now at 59 other astronauts and in

3422
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
looked now at 59 other astronauts and in
 

3423
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,589
looked now at 59 other astronauts and in
every astronaut that we've looked at

3424
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:53,599
every astronaut that we've looked at
 

3425
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,990
every astronaut that we've looked at
their telomeres get longer in space

3426
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,000
their telomeres get longer in space
 

3427
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,670
their telomeres get longer in space
does that indicate anything about

3428
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:57,680
does that indicate anything about
 

3429
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,990
does that indicate anything about
lifespan all those kinds of things or no

3430
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,000
lifespan all those kinds of things or no
 

3431
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,349
lifespan all those kinds of things or no
you can't make any of those kinds of

3432
00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:01,359
you can't make any of those kinds of
 

3433
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:03,109
you can't make any of those kinds of
jobs yes i won't make that jump yet but

3434
00:55:03,109 --> 00:55:03,119
jobs yes i won't make that jump yet but
 

3435
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,510
jobs yes i won't make that jump yet but
it does indicate that there is a version

3436
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:05,520
it does indicate that there is a version
 

3437
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,789
it does indicate that there is a version
of

3438
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:06,799
of
 

3439
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,230
of
cleansing if you will that's happening

3440
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
cleansing if you will that's happening
 

3441
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,630
cleansing if you will that's happening
in space a mixture of we see this

3442
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:10,640
in space a mixture of we see this
 

3443
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,230
in space a mixture of we see this
actually clinically at our hospital you

3444
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:12,240
actually clinically at our hospital you
 

3445
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,710
actually clinically at our hospital you
can do a low dose of radiation with some

3446
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:14,720
can do a low dose of radiation with some
 

3447
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,470
can do a low dose of radiation with some
targeted therapies to kind of activate

3448
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,480
targeted therapies to kind of activate
 

3449
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,109
targeted therapies to kind of activate
your immune cells is even even tried

3450
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
your immune cells is even even tried
 

3451
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,030
your immune cells is even even tried
clinically so this idea of just a little

3452
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:21,040
clinically so this idea of just a little
 

3453
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,470
clinically so this idea of just a little
bit of stress on the body or what's

3454
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:22,480
bit of stress on the body or what's
 

3455
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,630
bit of stress on the body or what's
called hormesis might prime you into

3456
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:24,640
called hormesis might prime you into
 

3457
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,549
called hormesis might prime you into
active of cleansing things that were

3458
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:26,559
active of cleansing things that were
 

3459
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,750
active of cleansing things that were
about to die and that includes stress uh

3460
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:29,760
about to die and that includes stress uh
 

3461
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,109
about to die and that includes stress uh
caused by space yes yeah apparently so

3462
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:33,119
caused by space yes yeah apparently so
 

3463
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,150
caused by space yes yeah apparently so
how do we

3464
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
how do we
 

3465
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,710
how do we
adapt the human body to stress of this

3466
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:38,720
adapt the human body to stress of this
 

3467
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,750
adapt the human body to stress of this
kind

3468
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:39,760
kind
 

3469
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,990
kind
for periods of multiple years

3470
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
for periods of multiple years
 

3471
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,309
for periods of multiple years
what what lessons do you draw from that

3472
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
what what lessons do you draw from that
 

3473
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:46,549
what what lessons do you draw from that
study and other experiments in space

3474
00:55:46,549 --> 00:55:46,559
study and other experiments in space
 

3475
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:47,589
study and other experiments in space
that

3476
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
that
 

3477
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,589
that
gives you an indication of how we can

3478
00:55:49,589 --> 00:55:49,599
gives you an indication of how we can
 

3479
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,750
gives you an indication of how we can
survive for multiple years

3480
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:51,760
survive for multiple years
 

3481
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,910
survive for multiple years
i think we know that the radiation is is

3482
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:53,920
i think we know that the radiation is is
 

3483
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,510
i think we know that the radiation is is
one of the biggest risk factors and this

3484
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
one of the biggest risk factors and this
 

3485
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,750
one of the biggest risk factors and this
has been well described by nasa and many

3486
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:57,760
has been well described by nasa and many
 

3487
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,630
has been well described by nasa and many
other astronauts and researchers and so

3488
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:00,640
other astronauts and researchers and so
 

3489
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,390
other astronauts and researchers and so
there we don't have to just

3490
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400
there we don't have to just
 

3491
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,390
there we don't have to just
measure the radiation or just look at

3492
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:04,400
measure the radiation or just look at
 

3493
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,630
measure the radiation or just look at
dna being damaged we can actually

3494
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640
dna being damaged we can actually
 

3495
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,069
dna being damaged we can actually
actively repair it this happens

3496
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
actively repair it this happens
 

3497
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,069
actively repair it this happens
naturally in all of our cells there's a

3498
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
naturally in all of our cells there's a
 

3499
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,030
naturally in all of our cells there's a
little enzymes little protein

3500
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:13,040
little enzymes little protein
 

3501
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,710
little enzymes little protein
really many machines that go around and

3502
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:14,720
really many machines that go around and
 

3503
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,710
really many machines that go around and
scan dna for nicks and breaks and repair

3504
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
scan dna for nicks and breaks and repair
 

3505
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,349
scan dna for nicks and breaks and repair
it

3506
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:17,359
it
 

3507
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,910
it
we could improve them we could add more

3508
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
we could improve them we could add more
 

3509
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,670
we could improve them we could add more
of them or you can even

3510
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:21,680
of them or you can even
 

3511
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,750
of them or you can even
activate them before you go into space

3512
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:23,760
activate them before you go into space
 

3513
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,150
activate them before you go into space
so we have a one set of cells in my lab

3514
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:26,160
so we have a one set of cells in my lab
 

3515
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,829
so we have a one set of cells in my lab
where you but you activate them before

3516
00:56:27,829 --> 00:56:27,839
where you but you activate them before
 

3517
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,190
where you but you activate them before
we irradiate them to actually prepare

3518
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
we irradiate them to actually prepare
 

3519
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,349
we irradiate them to actually prepare
them for the dose of radiation

3520
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:31,359
them for the dose of radiation
 

3521
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:34,230
them for the dose of radiation
and now that is what's called epigenetic

3522
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
and now that is what's called epigenetic
 

3523
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,750
and now that is what's called epigenetic
crispr therapies where you can actually

3524
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:35,760
crispr therapies where you can actually
 

3525
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,990
crispr therapies where you can actually
instead of adding or taking away a gene

3526
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:38,000
instead of adding or taking away a gene
 

3527
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,390
instead of adding or taking away a gene
or modifying a cell you just change kind

3528
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:40,400
or modifying a cell you just change kind
 

3529
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,430
or modifying a cell you just change kind
of how it's packaged like i was just

3530
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:41,440
of how it's packaged like i was just
 

3531
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,109
of how it's packaged like i was just
describing the dna

3532
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119
describing the dna
 

3533
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:44,390
describing the dna
the genes are still there we're just

3534
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
the genes are still there we're just
 

3535
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,750
the genes are still there we're just
changing how they get used and so you

3536
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
changing how they get used and so you
 

3537
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,150
changing how they get used and so you
can actually preemptively activate dna

3538
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:48,160
can actually preemptively activate dna
 

3539
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,430
can actually preemptively activate dna
repair genes and we've done this for

3540
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:49,440
repair genes and we've done this for
 

3541
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,630
repair genes and we've done this for
cells we haven't done this yet for

3542
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,640
cells we haven't done this yet for
 

3543
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,109
cells we haven't done this yet for
astronauts but we've done it for cells

3544
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,119
astronauts but we've done it for cells
 

3545
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,190
astronauts but we've done it for cells
and a similar idea to this is being used

3546
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:55,200
and a similar idea to this is being used
 

3547
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,109
and a similar idea to this is being used
to treat sickle cell disease and beta

3548
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:57,119
to treat sickle cell disease and beta
 

3549
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,630
to treat sickle cell disease and beta
thalassemias you actually you can

3550
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:58,640
thalassemias you actually you can
 

3551
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,789
thalassemias you actually you can
reactivate a gene that was dormant in

3552
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:00,799
reactivate a gene that was dormant in
 

3553
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,589
reactivate a gene that was dormant in
his way as a therapy so should we make

3554
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:03,599
his way as a therapy so should we make
 

3555
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,270
his way as a therapy so should we make
human genes resilient to harsh

3556
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:05,280
human genes resilient to harsh
 

3557
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,950
human genes resilient to harsh
conditions or should we get good at

3558
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:06,960
conditions or should we get good at
 

3559
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,789
conditions or should we get good at
repairing them

3560
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:08,799
repairing them
 

3561
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:11,190
repairing them
i want to i want to get good at right

3562
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
i want to i want to get good at right
 

3563
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,950
i want to i want to get good at right
okay start to interrupt

3564
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
okay start to interrupt
 

3565
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,549
okay start to interrupt
i think every time i ask this question

3566
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:14,559
i think every time i ask this question
 

3567
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,150
i think every time i ask this question
they have taught me

3568
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:16,160
they have taught me
 

3569
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,069
they have taught me
that there's always a third option

3570
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:18,079
that there's always a third option
 

3571
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,630
that there's always a third option
both i will say both

3572
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640
both i will say both
 

3573
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,870
both i will say both
i know uh you know for for copy it's

3574
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
i know uh you know for for copy it's
 

3575
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,630
i know uh you know for for copy it's
good to just have one big statement but

3576
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:24,640
good to just have one big statement but
 

3577
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,470
good to just have one big statement but
uh but you want to do both a good or a

3578
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:26,480
uh but you want to do both a good or a
 

3579
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,390
uh but you want to do both a good or a
third option i would want to you know do

3580
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:28,400
third option i would want to you know do
 

3581
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,910
third option i would want to you know do
electromagnetic shielding i would want

3582
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:29,920
electromagnetic shielding i would want
 

3583
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,829
electromagnetic shielding i would want
to do a fourth option of you know maybe

3584
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:31,839
to do a fourth option of you know maybe
 

3585
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:34,069
to do a fourth option of you know maybe
some other uh kind of physical defenses

3586
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:34,079
some other uh kind of physical defenses
 

3587
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,990
some other uh kind of physical defenses
outside of the human body yeah so

3588
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,000
outside of the human body yeah so
 

3589
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,670
outside of the human body yeah so
we're taking the same passion to keep

3590
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:37,680
we're taking the same passion to keep
 

3591
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,190
we're taking the same passion to keep
astronauts safe that's outside them and

3592
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:39,200
astronauts safe that's outside them and
 

3593
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,710
astronauts safe that's outside them and
just putting it in their cells is what i

3594
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
just putting it in their cells is what i
 

3595
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,789
just putting it in their cells is what i
propose now it's a bit radical today

3596
00:57:42,789 --> 00:57:42,799
propose now it's a bit radical today
 

3597
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,069
propose now it's a bit radical today
because

3598
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079
because
 

3599
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,069
because
uh you know we're just starting this in

3600
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:46,079
uh you know we're just starting this in
 

3601
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,430
uh you know we're just starting this in
clinical trials to treat you know

3602
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:47,440
clinical trials to treat you know
 

3603
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,510
clinical trials to treat you know
diseases on earth so it's not ready i

3604
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:49,520
diseases on earth so it's not ready i
 

3605
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,710
diseases on earth so it's not ready i
think to do an astronauts but in the

3606
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:50,720
think to do an astronauts but in the
 

3607
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,109
think to do an astronauts but in the
book i proposed by about the year 2040

3608
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
book i proposed by about the year 2040
 

3609
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,470
book i proposed by about the year 2040
that's when we'd reach this next phase

3610
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
that's when we'd reach this next phase
 

3611
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,069
that's when we'd reach this next phase
where i think we'll have known enough

3612
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:56,079
where i think we'll have known enough
 

3613
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,349
where i think we'll have known enough
about the clinical response we'll have

3614
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:57,359
about the clinical response we'll have
 

3615
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:59,109
about the clinical response we'll have
the technology ironed out

3616
00:57:59,109 --> 00:57:59,119
the technology ironed out
 

3617
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:00,390
the technology ironed out
that's about when it's time i think to

3618
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:00,400
that's about when it's time i think to
 

3619
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,430
that's about when it's time i think to
try it

3620
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:01,440
try it
 

3621
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,230
try it
so

3622
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:02,240
so
 

3623
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,910
so
what are the some interesting early

3624
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:03,920
what are the some interesting early
 

3625
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,109
what are the some interesting early
milestones

3626
00:58:05,109 --> 00:58:05,119
milestones
 

3627
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,829
milestones
so you said uh

3628
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:06,839
so you said uh
 

3629
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,430
so you said uh
2040 what do we have to look forward to

3630
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:09,440
2040 what do we have to look forward to
 

3631
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,510
2040 what do we have to look forward to
in the next 10 20 years according to

3632
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
in the next 10 20 years according to
 

3633
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,430
in the next 10 20 years according to
your book according to your thoughts a

3634
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:13,440
your book according to your thoughts a
 

3635
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,950
your book according to your thoughts a
lot of really exciting developments

3636
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:14,960
lot of really exciting developments
 

3637
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,829
lot of really exciting developments
where

3638
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:15,839
where
 

3639
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:16,870
where
if you

3640
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:16,880
if you
 

3641
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,870
if you
really want to activate genes like i was

3642
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:18,880
really want to activate genes like i was
 

3643
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,069
really want to activate genes like i was
just describing or or repair a specific

3644
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
just describing or or repair a specific
 

3645
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,910
just describing or or repair a specific
disease gene you can actually crispr it

3646
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:23,920
disease gene you can actually crispr it
 

3647
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,510
disease gene you can actually crispr it
out modify it this has been already

3648
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:25,520
out modify it this has been already
 

3649
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,670
out modify it this has been already
published and well documented but as

3650
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:27,680
published and well documented but as
 

3651
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,030
published and well documented but as
alluding to

3652
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,040
alluding to
 

3653
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,870
alluding to
more and more we'll see people that you

3654
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
more and more we'll see people that you
 

3655
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,390
more and more we'll see people that you
just want to temporarily change your

3656
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
just want to temporarily change your
 

3657
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,150
just want to temporarily change your
genes functions and change their

3658
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,160
genes functions and change their
 

3659
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,109
genes functions and change their
activity

3660
00:58:35,109 --> 00:58:35,119
activity
 

3661
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,270
activity
so the best example this is for beta

3662
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:37,280
so the best example this is for beta
 

3663
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,030
so the best example this is for beta
thalassemia we all have hemoglobin in

3664
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:39,040
thalassemia we all have hemoglobin in
 

3665
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,190
thalassemia we all have hemoglobin in
our blood that carries oxygen around and

3666
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:41,200
our blood that carries oxygen around and
 

3667
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,870
our blood that carries oxygen around and
we are an adult it's a different version

3668
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:42,880
we are an adult it's a different version
 

3669
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,390
we are an adult it's a different version
it's a different gene you have one gene

3670
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:44,400
it's a different gene you have one gene
 

3671
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,829
it's a different gene you have one gene
when you're a fetus called fetus fetal

3672
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:45,839
when you're a fetus called fetus fetal
 

3673
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,270
when you're a fetus called fetus fetal
hemoglobin when you're adult you have a

3674
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
hemoglobin when you're adult you have a
 

3675
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,870
hemoglobin when you're adult you have a
different gene but they both are making

3676
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:48,880
different gene but they both are making
 

3677
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,030
different gene but they both are making
a protein that carries oxygen when you

3678
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,040
a protein that carries oxygen when you
 

3679
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,470
a protein that carries oxygen when you
after you're born the fetal hemoglobin

3680
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:52,480
after you're born the fetal hemoglobin
 

3681
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,549
after you're born the fetal hemoglobin
gene gets just turned off just it goes

3682
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:54,559
gene gets just turned off just it goes
 

3683
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,150
gene gets just turned off just it goes
away and you replace it with adult

3684
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:56,160
away and you replace it with adult
 

3685
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,990
away and you replace it with adult
hemoglobin but if your gene for

3686
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
hemoglobin but if your gene for
 

3687
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,150
hemoglobin but if your gene for
hemoglobin is bad as an adult

3688
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:00,160
hemoglobin is bad as an adult
 

3689
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,430
hemoglobin is bad as an adult
that's one of the therapies well let's

3690
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:01,440
that's one of the therapies well let's
 

3691
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,349
that's one of the therapies well let's
turn back on the gene that you had when

3692
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
turn back on the gene that you had when
 

3693
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,630
turn back on the gene that you had when
you were a fetus and it's actually

3694
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:04,640
you were a fetus and it's actually
 

3695
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,549
you were a fetus and it's actually
already led to cures for sickle cell and

3696
00:59:06,549 --> 00:59:06,559
already led to cures for sickle cell and
 

3697
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,950
already led to cures for sickle cell and
beta thalassaemia in this past year

3698
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:08,960
beta thalassaemia in this past year
 

3699
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,150
beta thalassaemia in this past year
so it's this extraordinary idea of like

3700
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:10,160
so it's this extraordinary idea of like
 

3701
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,990
so it's this extraordinary idea of like
well you already have some of the

3702
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
well you already have some of the
 

3703
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,910
well you already have some of the
genetic solutions in your body why don't

3704
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,920
genetic solutions in your body why don't
 

3705
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,829
genetic solutions in your body why don't
we just reactivate them and see if you

3706
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:15,839
we just reactivate them and see if you
 

3707
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,190
we just reactivate them and see if you
can live and indeed you can so i think

3708
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:17,200
can live and indeed you can so i think
 

3709
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,030
can live and indeed you can so i think
we'll see more of that that's for severe

3710
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:19,040
we'll see more of that that's for severe
 

3711
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,230
we'll see more of that that's for severe
disease but eventually you could see it

3712
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:20,240
disease but eventually you could see it
 

3713
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,190
disease but eventually you could see it
for more

3714
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:21,200
for more
 

3715
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,870
for more
uh i think work-related purposes like if

3716
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
uh i think work-related purposes like if
 

3717
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,109
uh i think work-related purposes like if
you're working in a dangerous mind or a

3718
00:59:25,109 --> 00:59:25,119
you're working in a dangerous mind or a
 

3719
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,829
you're working in a dangerous mind or a
radio a high radiation environment you

3720
00:59:27,829 --> 00:59:27,839
radio a high radiation environment you
 

3721
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:29,430
radio a high radiation environment you
could you could basically start to prime

3722
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:29,440
could you could basically start to prime
 

3723
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,349
could you could basically start to prime
it for you know work safety basically we

3724
00:59:31,349 --> 00:59:31,359
it for you know work safety basically we
 

3725
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,670
it for you know work safety basically we
need to genetically protect you now it

3726
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:33,680
need to genetically protect you now it
 

3727
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,750
need to genetically protect you now it
would have to be shown that that genetic

3728
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:35,760
would have to be shown that that genetic
 

3729
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,030
would have to be shown that that genetic
option is safe reliable uh you know that

3730
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
option is safe reliable uh you know that
 

3731
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,870
option is safe reliable uh you know that
it's better that at least as good or if

3732
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:40,880
it's better that at least as good or if
 

3733
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,109
it's better that at least as good or if
not better than other shielding methods

3734
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:43,119
not better than other shielding methods
 

3735
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,549
not better than other shielding methods
but i think we'll start to see that more

3736
00:59:44,549 --> 00:59:44,559
but i think we'll start to see that more
 

3737
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:46,950
but i think we'll start to see that more
in the next 10 20 years and eventually

3738
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:46,960
in the next 10 20 years and eventually
 

3739
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,230
in the next 10 20 years and eventually
as i describe in the book you could get

3740
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:48,240
as i describe in the book you could get
 

3741
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,750
as i describe in the book you could get
to recreational genetics you could say

3742
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:49,760
to recreational genetics you could say
 

3743
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,990
to recreational genetics you could say
well i want to turn some genes on just

3744
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
well i want to turn some genes on just
 

3745
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,589
well i want to turn some genes on just
for this weekend because i'm going to a

3746
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:53,599
for this weekend because i'm going to a
 

3747
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,510
for this weekend because i'm going to a
high altitude so i'd like to prepare for

3748
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:55,520
high altitude so i'd like to prepare for
 

3749
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,870
high altitude so i'd like to prepare for
that and so instead of having to take

3750
00:59:56,870 --> 00:59:56,880
that and so instead of having to take
 

3751
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,789
that and so instead of having to take
weeks and weeks for acclimation

3752
00:59:58,789 --> 00:59:58,799
weeks and weeks for acclimation
 

3753
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,230
weeks and weeks for acclimation
you could just do some quick epigenetic

3754
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
you could just do some quick epigenetic
 

3755
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,670
you could just do some quick epigenetic
therapies and have a good time in the

3756
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:01,680
therapies and have a good time in the
 

3757
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,630
therapies and have a good time in the
mountains and then come back and turn

3758
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
mountains and then come back and turn
 

3759
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,870
mountains and then come back and turn
them back off so this is stuff to do on

3760
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:04,880
them back off so this is stuff to do on
 

3761
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,750
them back off so this is stuff to do on
earth yeah across thousands of humans

3762
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:07,760
earth yeah across thousands of humans
 

3763
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,270
earth yeah across thousands of humans
and then you start getting good data

3764
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,280
and then you start getting good data
 

3765
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,030
and then you start getting good data
about what the effects in the human body

3766
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:11,040
about what the effects in the human body
 

3767
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,910
about what the effects in the human body
are

3768
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
are
 

3769
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,950
are
how do we make humans survive across the

3770
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:14,960
how do we make humans survive across the
 

3771
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,950
how do we make humans survive across the
entire lifetime for well let's say

3772
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:16,960
entire lifetime for well let's say
 

3773
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,870
entire lifetime for well let's say
several decades in space

3774
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:18,880
several decades in space
 

3775
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,630
several decades in space
if it's just in space it'll be hard

3776
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:20,640
if it's just in space it'll be hard
 

3777
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,750
if it's just in space it'll be hard
because you'll you'll need basically

3778
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
because you'll you'll need basically
 

3779
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,030
because you'll you'll need basically
some gravity at some point i think you'd

3780
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:23,040
some gravity at some point i think you'd
 

3781
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,430
some gravity at some point i think you'd
need orbital platforms that give you at

3782
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:25,440
need orbital platforms that give you at
 

3783
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,390
need orbital platforms that give you at
least some partial gravity if not 1g

3784
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:28,400
least some partial gravity if not 1g
 

3785
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,390
least some partial gravity if not 1g
if you're on mars it's actually

3786
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,400
if you're on mars it's actually
 

3787
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,069
if you're on mars it's actually
you know even though the gravity is 38

3788
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:32,079
you know even though the gravity is 38
 

3789
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,910
you know even though the gravity is 38
of earth's just having that gravity

3790
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:33,920
of earth's just having that gravity
 

3791
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,950
of earth's just having that gravity
would be enough and if you could get

3792
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:34,960
would be enough and if you could get
 

3793
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,710
would be enough and if you could get
under the surface into some of the lava

3794
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:36,720
under the surface into some of the lava
 

3795
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:38,630
under the surface into some of the lava
tubes where you have some protection

3796
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:38,640
tubes where you have some protection
 

3797
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,109
tubes where you have some protection
above you from the radiation i think

3798
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:41,119
above you from the radiation i think
 

3799
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,870
above you from the radiation i think
that would be you probably could survive

3800
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:42,880
that would be you probably could survive
 

3801
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,630
that would be you probably could survive
quite well there so i think it's the

3802
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:44,640
quite well there so i think it's the
 

3803
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,150
quite well there so i think it's the
just in space part that's hard you need

3804
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,160
just in space part that's hard you need
 

3805
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,910
just in space part that's hard you need
some gravity you need some additional

3806
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:47,920
some gravity you need some additional
 

3807
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,870
some gravity you need some additional
protection from the radiation can you uh

3808
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:50,880
protection from the radiation can you uh
 

3809
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,190
protection from the radiation can you uh
linger on the lava tubes on mars what

3810
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:53,200
linger on the lava tubes on mars what
 

3811
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,870
linger on the lava tubes on mars what
are the lava tubes

3812
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:54,880
are the lava tubes
 

3813
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,109
are the lava tubes
yes so they are a bit like what they

3814
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:57,119
yes so they are a bit like what they
 

3815
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,789
yes so they are a bit like what they
sound like there were large masses of

3816
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
sound like there were large masses of
 

3817
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,670
sound like there were large masses of
lava at one point on the planet pushing

3818
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
lava at one point on the planet pushing
 

3819
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,750
lava at one point on the planet pushing
really quickly through the environment

3820
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:03,760
really quickly through the environment
 

3821
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,510
really quickly through the environment
and they created these these basically

3822
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:05,520
and they created these these basically
 

3823
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,430
and they created these these basically
these small caverns which you could go

3824
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:07,440
these small caverns which you could go
 

3825
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,670
these small caverns which you could go
in theory and build a small habitat and

3826
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:09,680
in theory and build a small habitat and
 

3827
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,190
in theory and build a small habitat and
then puff it up kind of like blowing up

3828
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:11,200
then puff it up kind of like blowing up
 

3829
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,230
then puff it up kind of like blowing up
a balloon

3830
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:12,240
a balloon
 

3831
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,990
a balloon
and have a protective habitat basically

3832
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,000
and have a protective habitat basically
 

3833
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,430
and have a protective habitat basically
it's a little bit underground so one of

3834
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:15,440
it's a little bit underground so one of
 

3835
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,349
it's a little bit underground so one of
the next helicopter missions being

3836
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:17,359
the next helicopter missions being
 

3837
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:18,870
the next helicopter missions being
planned at the jet propulsion lab is to

3838
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:18,880
planned at the jet propulsion lab is to
 

3839
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,069
planned at the jet propulsion lab is to
see if you can get a helicopter to go

3840
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:20,079
see if you can get a helicopter to go
 

3841
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,390
see if you can get a helicopter to go
into the lava tube and which is just

3842
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:22,400
into the lava tube and which is just
 

3843
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:23,829
into the lava tube and which is just
like as it sounds kind of like take out

3844
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:23,839
like as it sounds kind of like take out
 

3845
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:26,230
like as it sounds kind of like take out
a big worm that has burrowed into the

3846
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,240
a big worm that has burrowed into the
 

3847
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,230
a big worm that has burrowed into the
landscape and leave out the hollow

3848
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240
landscape and leave out the hollow
 

3849
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,750
landscape and leave out the hollow
column that's left and that's what your

3850
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
column that's left and that's what your
 

3851
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,270
column that's left and that's what your
tubes look like so one of the future

3852
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:31,280
tubes look like so one of the future
 

3853
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,589
tubes look like so one of the future
helicopters might even go explore one of

3854
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:33,599
helicopters might even go explore one of
 

3855
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,710
helicopters might even go explore one of
them is a mission being planned right

3856
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
them is a mission being planned right
 

3857
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,109
them is a mission being planned right
now so they're accessible without a

3858
01:01:37,109 --> 01:01:37,119
now so they're accessible without a
 

3859
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,470
now so they're accessible without a
significant amount of drilling yeah

3860
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
significant amount of drilling yeah
 

3861
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,670
significant amount of drilling yeah
that's the other advantage yeah you can

3862
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:39,680
that's the other advantage yeah you can
 

3863
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,109
that's the other advantage yeah you can
get to them uh because some of them are

3864
01:01:41,109 --> 01:01:41,119
get to them uh because some of them are
 

3865
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:42,150
get to them uh because some of them are
exposed you can do a little bit of

3866
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:42,160
exposed you can do a little bit of
 

3867
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,150
exposed you can do a little bit of
drilling and then see essentially this

3868
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,160
drilling and then see essentially this
 

3869
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,910
drilling and then see essentially this
entire thing texts you a little bit from

3870
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:45,920
entire thing texts you a little bit from
 

3871
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,109
entire thing texts you a little bit from
the radiation right because you have

3872
01:01:47,109 --> 01:01:47,119
the radiation right because you have
 

3873
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,630
the radiation right because you have
some soil above you basically which

3874
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:48,640
some soil above you basically which
 

3875
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,390
some soil above you basically which
would be a regalith which would be nice

3876
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:50,400
would be a regalith which would be nice
 

3877
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,710
would be a regalith which would be nice
what about source of food

3878
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720
what about source of food
 

3879
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,109
what about source of food
uh what's a good so that's part of

3880
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:55,119
uh what's a good so that's part of
 

3881
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,150
uh what's a good so that's part of
biology how you power this whole thing

3882
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:58,160
biology how you power this whole thing
 

3883
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,190
biology how you power this whole thing
what about source of food across decades

3884
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
what about source of food across decades
 

3885
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,789
what about source of food across decades
in space we'd have space plants have

3886
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
in space we'd have space plants have
 

3887
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,230
in space we'd have space plants have
been grown in flight and you can get

3888
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:04,240
been grown in flight and you can get
 

3889
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,630
been grown in flight and you can get
some nutrients but right now it is very

3890
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
some nutrients but right now it is very
 

3891
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,390
some nutrients but right now it is very
reliant on

3892
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:08,400
reliant on
 

3893
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,150
reliant on
all the up mass being sent up all the

3894
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:10,160
all the up mass being sent up all the
 

3895
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,670
all the up mass being sent up all the
you know freeze-dried fruit that thing

3896
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:11,680
you know freeze-dried fruit that thing
 

3897
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,829
you know freeze-dried fruit that thing
gets rehydrated which doesn't taste

3898
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:13,839
gets rehydrated which doesn't taste
 

3899
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,470
gets rehydrated which doesn't taste
awful but is is not uh

3900
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:16,480
awful but is is not uh
 

3901
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,150
awful but is is not uh
is not self-reliant right so i think

3902
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:18,160
is not self-reliant right so i think
 

3903
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,829
is not self-reliant right so i think
those would have to be small bioreactors

3904
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
those would have to be small bioreactors
 

3905
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,069
those would have to be small bioreactors
that have to be a lot of it work on

3906
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:22,079
that have to be a lot of it work on
 

3907
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:23,829
that have to be a lot of it work on
fermentation a lot of work on you know

3908
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
fermentation a lot of work on you know
 

3909
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,990
fermentation a lot of work on you know
potentially prototrophic organisms the

3910
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,000
potentially prototrophic organisms the
 

3911
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,990
potentially prototrophic organisms the
organisms that can make all of the 20

3912
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:28,000
organisms that can make all of the 20
 

3913
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,150
organisms that can make all of the 20
amino acids that you would need to eat i

3914
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:30,160
amino acids that you would need to eat i
 

3915
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,349
amino acids that you would need to eat i
described a little bit in the book what

3916
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:31,359
described a little bit in the book what
 

3917
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,270
described a little bit in the book what
if we did a prototrophic human where you

3918
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:33,280
if we did a prototrophic human where you
 

3919
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,510
if we did a prototrophic human where you
could have like right now we need to we

3920
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:35,520
could have like right now we need to we
 

3921
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,870
could have like right now we need to we
need to get some of our amino acids

3922
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:36,880
need to get some of our amino acids
 

3923
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,990
need to get some of our amino acids
because we can't make them all which i

3924
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:38,000
because we can't make them all which i
 

3925
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,430
because we can't make them all which i
think is kind of sad

3926
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,440
think is kind of sad
 

3927
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,710
think is kind of sad
so what if we could make all of our own

3928
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:40,720
so what if we could make all of our own
 

3929
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,190
so what if we could make all of our own
amino acids or all of our own vitamins i

3930
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
amino acids or all of our own vitamins i
 

3931
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,029
amino acids or all of our own vitamins i
also you know i think that's one case

3932
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:45,039
also you know i think that's one case
 

3933
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,109
also you know i think that's one case
where another adaptation could be to

3934
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:47,119
where another adaptation could be to
 

3935
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,190
where another adaptation could be to
activate the vitamin c gene

3936
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:49,200
activate the vitamin c gene
 

3937
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:50,390
activate the vitamin c gene
like right right now you'd have to have

3938
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:50,400
like right right now you'd have to have
 

3939
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,910
like right right now you'd have to have
limes or some other source of vitamin c

3940
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:51,920
limes or some other source of vitamin c
 

3941
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,870
limes or some other source of vitamin c
in space

3942
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:52,880
in space
 

3943
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,710
in space
but we actually carry the gene inside of

3944
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:54,720
but we actually carry the gene inside of
 

3945
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,710
but we actually carry the gene inside of
our genome to make vitamin c look at

3946
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
our genome to make vitamin c look at
 

3947
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,990
our genome to make vitamin c look at
dogs and cats for example they have

3948
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
dogs and cats for example they have
 

3949
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,589
dogs and cats for example they have
these kind of wet noses

3950
01:02:59,589 --> 01:02:59,599
these kind of wet noses
 

3951
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:00,829
these kind of wet noses
you don't see them going out and getting

3952
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:00,839
you don't see them going out and getting
 

3953
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:02,549
you don't see them going out and getting
margaritas

3954
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:02,559
margaritas
 

3955
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,710
margaritas
dogs can drink beer and get drunk

3956
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,720
dogs can drink beer and get drunk
 

3957
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,950
dogs can drink beer and get drunk
they don't need vitamin c they have no

3958
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:06,960
they don't need vitamin c they have no
 

3959
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,950
they don't need vitamin c they have no
risk of scurvy because they can make the

3960
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:08,960
risk of scurvy because they can make the
 

3961
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,270
risk of scurvy because they can make the
vitamin c all by themselves so can other

3962
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:11,280
vitamin c all by themselves so can other
 

3963
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,589
vitamin c all by themselves so can other
wet-nosed primates called strep-serines

3964
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:13,599
wet-nosed primates called strep-serines
 

3965
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:15,589
wet-nosed primates called strep-serines
but we are dry nose primates and we we

3966
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:15,599
but we are dry nose primates and we we
 

3967
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,390
but we are dry nose primates and we we
lost this ability sometimes 10 or 20

3968
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
lost this ability sometimes 10 or 20
 

3969
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,670
lost this ability sometimes 10 or 20
million years ago we no longer make our

3970
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:19,680
million years ago we no longer make our
 

3971
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,589
million years ago we no longer make our
own vitamin c but the gene for it is

3972
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:21,599
own vitamin c but the gene for it is
 

3973
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,670
own vitamin c but the gene for it is
called gullo is still in our dna it's

3974
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:23,680
called gullo is still in our dna it's
 

3975
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,029
called gullo is still in our dna it's
what's called a pseudogene it's just

3976
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:25,039
what's called a pseudogene it's just
 

3977
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,069
what's called a pseudogene it's just
broken down

3978
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:26,079

to make as much food in orbit you could
 

4025
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,710

wasn't human but humans uh love food and

4042
01:04:22,549 --> 01:04:22,559
wasn't human but humans uh love food and

01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,270
wasn't human but humans uh love food and
flavors and textures and smells all that

all of that is actually attenuated in
flight so it's you'd want to

4048
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:28,880
flight so it's you'd want to
 

4049
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,109
flight so it's you'd want to
not forget our humanity and so this this

4050
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:31,119
not forget our humanity and so this this
 

4051
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,910
not forget our humanity and so this this
you know love of of all the benefits and

01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:33,920
you know love of of all the benefits and
 

4053
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,549

people bring that up basically food that

4070
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:56,160
people bring that up basically food that
 

4071
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,470
people bring that up basically food that
has sex with itself and multiplies

loves bed bugs lou sorkin

4086
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:11,440
loves bed bugs lou sorkin
 

4087
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,430
loves bed bugs lou sorkin
and he has a monthly meeting where he

4088
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:13,440
and he has a monthly meeting where he
 

4089
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,870
and he has a monthly meeting where he
talks about how which insects would be

4090
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:14,880
talks about how which insects would be
 

4091
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,430
talks about how which insects would be
the best for eating and one one month he

4092
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,440
the best for eating and one one month he
 

4093
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,950
the best for eating and one one month he
gave a whole talk about bed bugs that

4094
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
gave a whole talk about bed bugs that
 

4095
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,270
gave a whole talk about bed bugs that
they're pretty gross but in terms of the

4096
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:21,280
they're pretty gross but in terms of the
 

4097
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,270
they're pretty gross but in terms of the
value of what you can get for protein

4098
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,280
value of what you can get for protein
 

4099
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,029
value of what you can get for protein
they're really good so

4100
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:25,039
they're really good so
 

4101
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,470
they're really good so
they're they're a good candidate i think

4102
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:26,480
they're they're a good candidate i think
 

4103
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,309
they're they're a good candidate i think
you'd have if you could deep fry them if

4104
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:28,319
you'd have if you could deep fry them if
 

4105
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,510
you'd have if you could deep fry them if
you deep fry anything you can pretty

4106
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
you deep fry anything you can pretty
 

4107
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,950
you deep fry anything you can pretty
much eat it so maybe you need a fryer up

4108
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
much eat it so maybe you need a fryer up
 

4109
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,910
much eat it so maybe you need a fryer up
in space but now they're a candidate

4110
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:33,920
in space but now they're a candidate
 

4111
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,230
in space but now they're a candidate
all right what uh technical question

4112
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:36,240
all right what uh technical question
 

4113
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,470
all right what uh technical question
what are the major challenges of sex in

4114
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:38,480
what are the major challenges of sex in
 

4115
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,390
what are the major challenges of sex in
space asking for a friend for

4116
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:40,400
space asking for a friend for
 

4117
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,710
space asking for a friend for
reproduction purposes

4118
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:42,720
reproduction purposes
 

4119
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,630
reproduction purposes
so like uh when we're looking about

4120
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
so like uh when we're looking about
 

4121
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,670
so like uh when we're looking about
survival the human species across

4122
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:47,680
survival the human species across
 

4123
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,270
survival the human species across
generations yeah do we need gravity

4124
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:51,280
generations yeah do we need gravity
 

4125
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,430
generations yeah do we need gravity
essentially for sex and space we we know

4126
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:53,440
essentially for sex and space we we know
 

4127
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,109
essentially for sex and space we we know
that gestation can happen in space where

4128
01:05:55,109 --> 01:05:55,119
that gestation can happen in space where
 

4129
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,109
that gestation can happen in space where
the babies can develop at least in mice

4130
01:05:57,109 --> 01:05:57,119
the babies can develop at least in mice
 

4131
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,870
the babies can develop at least in mice
we know that it's possible for worms to

4132
01:05:58,870 --> 01:05:58,880
we know that it's possible for worms to
 

4133
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,829
we know that it's possible for worms to
replicate and fly so it's possible

4134
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:01,839
replicate and fly so it's possible
 

4135
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,990
replicate and fly so it's possible
to for other invertebrates to show they

4136
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,000
to for other invertebrates to show they
 

4137
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,069
to for other invertebrates to show they
can make babies in space but for humans

4138
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:06,079
can make babies in space but for humans
 

4139
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:07,910
can make babies in space but for humans
nasa's official stance on this is that

4140
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
nasa's official stance on this is that
 

4141
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,670
nasa's official stance on this is that
there has never been sex in space yeah

4142
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:09,680
there has never been sex in space yeah
 

4143
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,029
there has never been sex in space yeah
officially

4144
01:06:11,029 --> 01:06:11,039
officially
 

4145
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,430
officially
i i think

4146
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
i i think
 

4147
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,950
i i think
you know if we all

4148
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:14,960
you know if we all
 

4149
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:16,549
you know if we all
wonder about that

4150
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:16,559
wonder about that
 

4151
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,349
wonder about that
i think humans are very predictable in

4152
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:19,359
i think humans are very predictable in
 

4153
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:20,470
i think humans are very predictable in
that regard again going back to the

4154
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:20,480
that regard again going back to the
 

4155
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,309
that regard again going back to the
greek tragedies i think that there's

4156
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:22,319
greek tragedies i think that there's
 

4157
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:23,670
greek tragedies i think that there's
probably someone did something close to

4158
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
probably someone did something close to
 

4159
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,910
probably someone did something close to
it at some point and so i think we we

4160
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:25,920
it at some point and so i think we we
 

4161
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,510
it at some point and so i think we we
know that sperm can be sent into space

4162
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:27,520
know that sperm can be sent into space
 

4163
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,470
know that sperm can be sent into space
and brought back and be used for

4164
01:06:28,470 --> 01:06:28,480
and brought back and be used for
 

4165
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,069
and brought back and be used for
fertilization for uh in vitro

4166
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:30,079
fertilization for uh in vitro
 

4167
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,309
fertilization for uh in vitro
fertilization for humans but sex itself

4168
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:32,319
fertilization for humans but sex itself
 

4169
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,710
fertilization for humans but sex itself
in space uh you know would be i think

4170
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:34,720
in space uh you know would be i think
 

4171
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,069
in space uh you know would be i think
when we start to get bigger structures

4172
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:36,079
when we start to get bigger structures
 

4173
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:38,069
when we start to get bigger structures
that have a bit more privacy

4174
01:06:38,069 --> 01:06:38,079
that have a bit more privacy
 

4175
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,190
that have a bit more privacy
i think they'll i think there'll be a

4176
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
i think they'll i think there'll be a
 

4177
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,789
i think they'll i think there'll be a
lot of it and it has to be you know this

4178
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:40,799
lot of it and it has to be you know this
 

4179
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:42,390
lot of it and it has to be you know this
this is a big question of who goes up

4180
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:42,400
this is a big question of who goes up
 

4181
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,670
this is a big question of who goes up
into space

4182
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:43,680
into space
 

4183
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,309
into space
it's now becoming more of you know

4184
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:46,319
it's now becoming more of you know
 

4185
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,950
it's now becoming more of you know
regular in quotes people who have

4186
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:48,960
regular in quotes people who have
 

4187
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,789
regular in quotes people who have
prosthetic limbs or cancer survivors

4188
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:50,799
prosthetic limbs or cancer survivors
 

4189
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:52,230
prosthetic limbs or cancer survivors
like haley arsenau who just went up on

4190
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:52,240
like haley arsenau who just went up on
 

4191
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,910
like haley arsenau who just went up on
the inspiration for mission so she's

4192
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:53,920
the inspiration for mission so she's
 

4193
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,589
the inspiration for mission so she's
been a great uh researcher in helping

4194
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:55,599
been a great uh researcher in helping
 

4195
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:56,549
been a great uh researcher in helping
with a lot of the science from that

4196
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:56,559
with a lot of the science from that
 

4197
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:57,990
with a lot of the science from that
mission we have doing the same analysis

4198
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
mission we have doing the same analysis
 

4199
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,109
mission we have doing the same analysis
on them as we've been doing for the twin

4200
01:06:59,109 --> 01:06:59,119
on them as we've been doing for the twin
 

4201
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,870
on them as we've been doing for the twin
study and for other astronauts we're

4202
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:00,880
study and for other astronauts we're
 

4203
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,230
study and for other astronauts we're
doing basically all the same molecular

4204
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:02,240
doing basically all the same molecular
 

4205
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,230
doing basically all the same molecular
profile before during an after space

4206
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
profile before during an after space
 

4207
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,390
profile before during an after space
flight so there we now know that you

4208
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,400
flight so there we now know that you
 

4209
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,750
flight so there we now know that you
know other people can go into space

4210
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:07,760
know other people can go into space
 

4211
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,510
know other people can go into space
those more and more regular joes and

4212
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:09,520
those more and more regular joes and
 

4213
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,789
those more and more regular joes and
jane's go up

4214
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
jane's go up
 

4215
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,549
jane's go up
i think we'll see a lot more of it but

4216
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:12,559
i think we'll see a lot more of it but
 

4217
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:14,870
i think we'll see a lot more of it but
so far we'd have no data

4218
01:07:14,870 --> 01:07:14,880
so far we'd have no data
 

4219
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,870
so far we'd have no data
we have no video of it either way we

4220
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:16,880
we have no video of it either way we
 

4221
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,230
we have no video of it either way we
have no real knowledge other than it

4222
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
have no real knowledge other than it
 

4223
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,230
have no real knowledge other than it
would be it would need a lot of velcro i

4224
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:20,240
would be it would need a lot of velcro i
 

4225
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,150
would be it would need a lot of velcro i
think is my only real answer there well

4226
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,160
think is my only real answer there well
 

4227
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,109
think is my only real answer there well
i i'm as a fan of velcro and duct tape i

4228
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:25,119
i i'm as a fan of velcro and duct tape i
 

4229
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,549
i i'm as a fan of velcro and duct tape i
think that's going to be

4230
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:26,559
think that's going to be
 

4231
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,190
think that's going to be
yes those two are essential for anything

4232
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:29,200
yes those two are essential for anything
 

4233
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,349
yes those two are essential for anything
any kind of engineering out in

4234
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:31,359
any kind of engineering out in
 

4235
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,109
any kind of engineering out in
anywhere honestly in all kinds of harsh

4236
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:33,119
anywhere honestly in all kinds of harsh
 

4237
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,150
anywhere honestly in all kinds of harsh
conditions

4238
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:34,160
conditions
 

4239
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,829
conditions
but um

4240
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:35,839
but um
 

4241
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,430
but um
that is i mean

4242
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:37,440
that is i mean
 

4243
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:39,510
that is i mean
on the topic of sex in general just

4244
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:39,520
on the topic of sex in general just
 

4245
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,670
on the topic of sex in general just
social interaction with humans

4246
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
social interaction with humans
 

4247
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,349
social interaction with humans
it's fascinating the the current

4248
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
it's fascinating the the current
 

4249
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,069
it's fascinating the the current
missions are very focused on science and

4250
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
missions are very focused on science and
 

4251
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,309
missions are very focused on science and
very technical engineering things but

4252
01:07:48,309 --> 01:07:48,319
very technical engineering things but
 

4253
01:07:48,319 --> 01:07:50,069
very technical engineering things but
there's still a human element absolutely

4254
01:07:50,069 --> 01:07:50,079
there's still a human element absolutely
 

4255
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,630
there's still a human element absolutely
that seeps in and the more we travel out

4256
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:52,640
that seeps in and the more we travel out
 

4257
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,870
that seeps in and the more we travel out
the space the more the humans

4258
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
the space the more the humans
 

4259
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,870
the space the more the humans
the natural human drama

4260
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
the natural human drama
 

4261
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,510
the natural human drama
the love the hate that merges it's all

4262
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
the love the hate that merges it's all
 

4263
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,789
the love the hate that merges it's all
going to be right there it's a greek

4264
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
going to be right there it's a greek
 

4265
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:02,309
going to be right there it's a greek
tragedy just in space basically i think

4266
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:02,319
tragedy just in space basically i think
 

4267
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:06,470
tragedy just in space basically i think
it's going to be a reality show

4268
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:06,480

 

4269
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,510

so

4270
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:07,520
so
 

4271
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,109
so
what about the colonization of other

4272
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
what about the colonization of other
 

4273
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:14,390
what about the colonization of other
planets if you look at mars when you

4274
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:14,400

 

4275
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,630

first of all do you think it's a worthy

4276
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:16,640
first of all do you think it's a worthy
 

4277
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,390
first of all do you think it's a worthy
effort looking at this particular one

4278
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:18,400
effort looking at this particular one
 

4279
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,309
effort looking at this particular one
planet to put humans on mars

4280
01:08:22,309 --> 01:08:22,319
planet to put humans on mars
 

4281
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,110
planet to put humans on mars
and to start thinking about colonizing

4282
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:25,120
and to start thinking about colonizing
 

4283
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:26,470
and to start thinking about colonizing
mars

4284
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
mars
 

4285
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,630
mars
it's one of the closest options it's not

4286
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
it's one of the closest options it's not
 

4287
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,269
it's one of the closest options it's not
the best option though by far we we uh i

4288
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:31,279
the best option though by far we we uh i
 

4289
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:32,709
the best option though by far we we uh i
put in the book measures of earth

4290
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:32,719
put in the book measures of earth
 

4291
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:34,149
put in the book measures of earth

how close is it to earth is a
calculation many astronomers make when

4302
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:44,000
calculation many astronomers make when
 

4303
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,229
calculation many astronomers make when
they look for exoplanets and mars is

4304
01:08:46,229 --> 01:08:46,239
they look for exoplanets and mars is
 

4305
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:48,309
they look for exoplanets and mars is
pretty far away from

4306
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:48,319
pretty far away from
 

4307
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,110
pretty far away from
an esi of about 0.7 and earth is one so

4308
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,120
an esi of about 0.7 and earth is one so
 

4309
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,309
an esi of about 0.7 and earth is one so
the best you can get is one earth is

4310
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
the best you can get is one earth is
 

4311
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:53,749
the best you can get is one earth is
just like earth

4312
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:53,759
just like earth
 

4313
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,070
just like earth
it gets a score of one anything above

it gets a score of one anything above
 

4315
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,510
it gets a score of one anything above
you know some of the best exoplanets

4316
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:57,520
you know some of the best exoplanets
 

4317
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,870
you know some of the best exoplanets
that are in the habitable zone where

4318
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:58,880
that are in the habitable zone where
 

4319
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,630
that are in the habitable zone where
there's liquid water that could be there

there's liquid water that could be there
 

4321
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,470
there's liquid water that could be there
start to get above 0.8 or 0.9 but

4322
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:02,480
start to get above 0.8 or 0.9 but
 

4323
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,349
start to get above 0.8 or 0.9 but
they're

4324
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:03,359
they're
 

4325
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,430
they're
most planets are very low they're 0.1.2

4326
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,440
most planets are very low they're 0.1.2
 

4327
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,510
most planets are very low they're 0.1.2
they're either way too big and we have

4328
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
they're either way too big and we have
 

4329
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,590
they're either way too big and we have
crushing gravity or way too small too

4330
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
crushing gravity or way too small too
 

4331
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,189
crushing gravity or way too small too
close to a sun

4332
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:11,199
close to a sun
 

4333
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:11,910
close to a sun
but

4334
01:09:11,910 --> 01:09:11,920
but
 

4335
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,590
but
mars is even though it's not that great

4336
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,600
mars is even though it's not that great
 

4337
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,910
mars is even though it's not that great
on the esi scale it is still very

4338
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:15,920
on the esi scale it is still very
 

4339
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,550
on the esi scale it is still very
relatively close you know galactically

4340
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:18,560
relatively close you know galactically
 

4341
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,550
relatively close you know galactically
and and venus is just too hot right now

4342
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:20,560
and and venus is just too hot right now
 

4343
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,910
and and venus is just too hot right now
so i think venus would also be a great

4344
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920
so i think venus would also be a great
 

4345
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,510
so i think venus would also be a great
candidate but it is

4346
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
candidate but it is
 

4347
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,510
candidate but it is
it's much easier to survive in a place

4348
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:25,520
it's much easier to survive in a place
 

4349
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,789
it's much easier to survive in a place
where it's very cold but you can be

4350
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:26,799
where it's very cold but you can be
 

4351
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,789
where it's very cold but you can be
sealed and survive whereas going on we

4352
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:28,799
sealed and survive whereas going on we
 

4353
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:29,910
sealed and survive whereas going on we
probably just have no technology to

4354
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
probably just have no technology to
 

4355
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,349
probably just have no technology to
survive anywhere except in the clouds of

4356
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:31,359
survive anywhere except in the clouds of
 

4357
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:32,470
survive anywhere except in the clouds of
venus so

4358
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:32,480
venus so
 

4359
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,309
venus so
it's just currently our best option but

4360
01:09:34,309 --> 01:09:34,319
it's just currently our best option but
 

4361
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,390
it's just currently our best option but
it's not the best option for sure so

4362
01:09:36,390 --> 01:09:36,400
it's not the best option for sure so
 

4363
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,030
it's not the best option for sure so
over time the esi changes across

4364
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
over time the esi changes across
 

4365
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,749
over time the esi changes across
millennia and it does so the venus is

4366
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:41,759
millennia and it does so the venus is
 

4367
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,910
millennia and it does so the venus is
going to get cooler and cooler

4368
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:43,920
going to get cooler and cooler
 

4369
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,430
going to get cooler and cooler
um okay

4370
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:45,440
um okay
 

4371
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,590
um okay
but what are the big challenges to you

4372
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:47,600
but what are the big challenges to you
 

4373
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,229
but what are the big challenges to you
in colonizing mars from a biology

4374
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:50,239
in colonizing mars from a biology
 

4375
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:51,910
in colonizing mars from a biology
perspective from a human perspective

4376
01:09:51,910 --> 01:09:51,920
perspective from a human perspective
 

4377
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:53,990
perspective from a human perspective
from an engineering perspective

4378
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
from an engineering perspective
 

4379
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,510
from an engineering perspective
there's several big challenges to mars

4380
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:55,520
there's several big challenges to mars
 

4381
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,790
there's several big challenges to mars
and even the first one is even just the

4382
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,800
and even the first one is even just the
 

4383
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,470
and even the first one is even just the
word colonized so i think we there's

4384
01:09:58,470 --> 01:09:58,480
word colonized so i think we there's
 

4385
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,910
word colonized so i think we there's
even a social challenge like a lot of

4386
01:09:59,910 --> 01:09:59,920
even a social challenge like a lot of
 

4387
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,510
even a social challenge like a lot of
people

4388
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
people
 

4389
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,870
people
danielle wood actually studies this at

01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,910
danielle wood actually studies this at
mit

4392
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
mit
 

4393
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:04,950
mit
is

4394
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
is
 

4395
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,070
is
sh we shouldn't even use the word

4396
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:06,080
sh we shouldn't even use the word
 

4397
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,590
sh we shouldn't even use the word
colonized but then we probably shouldn't

4398
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:07,600
colonized but then we probably shouldn't
 

4399
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:08,709
colonized but then we probably shouldn't
use the word settle either because

4400
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:08,719
use the word settle either because
 

4401
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,470
use the word settle either because
there's settlements that have some other

4402
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:10,480
there's settlements that have some other
 

4403
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,990
there's settlements that have some other
baggage to that word as well and then

4404
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,000
baggage to that word as well and then
 

4405
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,350
baggage to that word as well and then
maybe we just use the word explore but

4406
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:13,360
maybe we just use the word explore but
 

4407
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,030
maybe we just use the word explore but
at some point you didn't say we're going

4408
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:15,040
at some point you didn't say we're going
 

4409
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,709
at some point you didn't say we're going
there to survive there and so

4410
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:16,719
there to survive there and so
 

4411
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,070
there to survive there and so
colonization still is the word most

4412
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,080
colonization still is the word most
 

4413
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,630
colonization still is the word most
people use but i try to say go explore

4414
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:20,640
people use but i try to say go explore
 

4415
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,030
people use but i try to say go explore
and build or settle but i think the

4416
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:23,040
and build or settle but i think the
 

4417
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:24,709
and build or settle but i think the
first challenge is social i think

4418
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
first challenge is social i think
 

4419
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,470
first challenge is social i think
getting people to think that this will

4420
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:26,480
getting people to think that this will
 

4421
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,550
getting people to think that this will
not be like the colonization efforts of

4422
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:28,560
not be like the colonization efforts of
 

4423
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,630
not be like the colonization efforts of
the past the hope is that this will be a

4424
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:30,640
the past the hope is that this will be a
 

4425
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,149
the past the hope is that this will be a
very different version of humanity

4426
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:32,159
very different version of humanity
 

4427
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:33,910
very different version of humanity
exploring that's my hope

4428
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920
exploring that's my hope
 

4429
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,910
exploring that's my hope
history has you could say has proved me

4430
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:35,920
history has you could say has proved me
 

4431
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,669
history has you could say has proved me
wrong every single time like every time

4432
01:10:37,669 --> 01:10:37,679
wrong every single time like every time
 

4433
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:39,669
wrong every single time like every time
humans have gone somewhere it's usually

4434
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:39,679
humans have gone somewhere it's usually
 

4435
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,950
humans have gone somewhere it's usually
been a tale of exploitation strife

4436
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:42,960
been a tale of exploitation strife
 

4437
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,590
been a tale of exploitation strife
and and drama again and then and and

4438
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:45,600
and and drama again and then and and
 

4439
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,750
and and drama again and then and and
often murder genocide like it's actually

4440
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:47,760
often murder genocide like it's actually
 

4441
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,669
often murder genocide like it's actually
a pretty dark history if you think of

4442
01:10:49,669 --> 01:10:49,679
a pretty dark history if you think of
 

4443
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,070
a pretty dark history if you think of
just all the colonization efforts but i

4444
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:52,080
just all the colonization efforts but i
 

4445
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:52,950
just all the colonization efforts but i
think

4446
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:52,960
think
 

4447
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,950
think
most of it was done in a really dark

4448
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960
most of it was done in a really dark
 

4449
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,790
most of it was done in a really dark
area of humanity where their average

it was
it was a rough existence right so i

it was a rough existence right so i
 

4463

it was a rough existence right so i
think some of the the the ugliness of

we would have it be much more i think uh

01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
we would have it be much more i think uh
 

4473
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,189
we would have it be much more i think uh

we'd go there
 

4481
01:11:24,719 --> 01:11:26,070
we'd go there
and you would need commercialization you

4482
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:26,080
and you would need commercialization you
 

4483
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,229
and you would need commercialization you
need efforts to do mining for example

4484
01:11:28,229 --> 01:11:28,239
need efforts to do mining for example
 

4485
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,070
need efforts to do mining for example
bring things back but it'd have to be

4486
01:11:30,070 --> 01:11:30,080
bring things back but it'd have to be
 

4487
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,510
bring things back but it'd have to be
some degree where there are some areas

4488
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:31,520
some degree where there are some areas
 

4489
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,669
some degree where there are some areas
that are viewed as as as commons or that

that are viewed as as as commons or that
 

4491
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:34,950
that are viewed as as as commons or that
are untouchable like places that are

parks we do this today even if there's a

4494
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:37,679
parks we do this today even if there's a
 

4495
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,990
parks we do this today even if there's a
lake for example the first you know

4496
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:40,000
lake for example the first you know
 

4497
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,430
lake for example the first you know
several hundred feet of a lake are all

4498
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:41,440
several hundred feet of a lake are all
 

4499
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,709
several hundred feet of a lake are all
for public property and everything you

4500
01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:42,719
for public property and everything you
 

4501
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:43,910
for public property and everything you
can own property but just not certain

4502
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:43,920
can own property but just not certain
 

4503
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,270
can own property but just not certain
barriers so i think we'd have to make

4504
01:11:45,270 --> 01:11:45,280
barriers so i think we'd have to make
 

4505
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,630
barriers so i think we'd have to make
sure we do that so that it's not

4506
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:46,640
sure we do that so that it's not
 

4507
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,709
sure we do that so that it's not
completely exploited but the so that's

4508
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:48,719
completely exploited but the so that's
 

4509
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,550
completely exploited but the so that's
on the social the human side the

4510
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:50,560
on the social the human side the
 

4511
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,910
on the social the human side the
technological we've talked a little bit

4512
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:51,920
technological we've talked a little bit
 

4513
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,030
technological we've talked a little bit
about where you'd have to live you want

4514
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:53,040
about where you'd have to live you want
 

4515
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,630
about where you'd have to live you want
to be underground with engineering and

4516
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:54,640
to be underground with engineering and
 

4517
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,229
to be underground with engineering and
modifying even human cells to make sure

4518
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:56,239
modifying even human cells to make sure
 

4519
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:57,510
modifying even human cells to make sure
you survive

4520
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:57,520
you survive
 

4521
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,030
you survive
uh the soil does have a lot of

4522
01:11:59,030 --> 01:11:59,040
uh the soil does have a lot of
 

4523
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,310
uh the soil does have a lot of
perchlorates which is a problem for

4524
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:00,320
perchlorates which is a problem for
 

4525
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,590
perchlorates which is a problem for
growing them but there's ways to extract

4526
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:01,600
growing them but there's ways to extract
 

4527
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,430
growing them but there's ways to extract
them there's a fair amount of water

4528
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:03,440
them there's a fair amount of water
 

4529
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,790
them there's a fair amount of water
there's actually a beautiful image of

4530
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:04,800
there's actually a beautiful image of
 

4531
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,270
there's actually a beautiful image of
all the known water on mars that nasa

4532
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,280
all the known water on mars that nasa
 

4533
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:08,950
all the known water on mars that nasa
posted about a year ago and there's

4534
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:08,960
posted about a year ago and there's
 

4535
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,110
posted about a year ago and there's
water everywhere not not lots of it

4536
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:11,120
water everywhere not not lots of it
 

4537
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:12,550
water everywhere not not lots of it
everywhere but you almost everywhere you

4538
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:12,560
everywhere but you almost everywhere you
 

4539
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,510
everywhere but you almost everywhere you
look there's at least a little bit of

4540
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
look there's at least a little bit of
 

4541
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:15,990
look there's at least a little bit of
water just a few feet under the surface

4542
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,000
water just a few feet under the surface
 

4543
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,149
water just a few feet under the surface
and by the caps there's a lot so i think

4544
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
and by the caps there's a lot so i think
 

4545
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:19,669
and by the caps there's a lot so i think
we could get some water and we could

4546
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
we could get some water and we could
 

4547
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,390
we could get some water and we could
also do you know self-generating

4548
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,400
also do you know self-generating
 

4549
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,550
also do you know self-generating
reactors machines that could make food

4550
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:24,560
reactors machines that could make food
 

4551
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,390
reactors machines that could make food
start to even make beer

4552
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:26,400
start to even make beer
 

4553
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,630
start to even make beer
if you go long enough down the path but

4554
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:28,640
if you go long enough down the path but
 

4555
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,709
if you go long enough down the path but
the technical challenges are definitely

4556
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:30,719
the technical challenges are definitely
 

4557
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,590
the technical challenges are definitely
the

4558
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:31,600
the
 

4559
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,510
the
engineering and the manufacturing are

4560
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:33,520
engineering and the manufacturing are
 

4561
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,950
engineering and the manufacturing are
going to be hard because you have to

4562
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
going to be hard because you have to
 

4563
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,470
going to be hard because you have to
build the buildings basically out of the

4564
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:36,480
build the buildings basically out of the
 

4565
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,709
build the buildings basically out of the
soil that's there so you have to really

4566
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:38,719
soil that's there so you have to really
 

4567
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:39,990
soil that's there so you have to really
go there and try and build with whatever

4568
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:40,000
go there and try and build with whatever
 

4569
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,430
go there and try and build with whatever
you can so that has to be perfected

4570
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:41,440
you can so that has to be perfected
 

4571
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,950
you can so that has to be perfected
still but then once you're in those

4572
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:42,960
still but then once you're in those
 

4573
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,229
still but then once you're in those
those buildings those structures you

4574
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:44,239
those buildings those structures you
 

4575
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,070
those buildings those structures you
need to create all the biology that will

4576
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:46,080
need to create all the biology that will
 

4577
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,630
need to create all the biology that will
feed the the populous feed them so

4578
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:48,640
feed the the populous feed them so
 

4579
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,229
feed the the populous feed them so
which we don't have the technology for

4580
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:50,239
which we don't have the technology for
 

4581
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,350
which we don't have the technology for
yet we have bits of it but i think

4582
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:51,360
yet we have bits of it but i think
 

4583
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,390
yet we have bits of it but i think
that's going to be the biggest challenge

4584
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:52,400
that's going to be the biggest challenge
 

4585
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,110
that's going to be the biggest challenge
is

4586
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,120
is
 

4587
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,950
is
making mars really truly independent but

4588
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960
making mars really truly independent but
 

4589
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,470
making mars really truly independent but
that'll probably take as i say in the

4590
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:56,480
that'll probably take as i say in the
 

4591
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,229
that'll probably take as i say in the
book several hundred years before i

4592
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:58,239
book several hundred years before i
 

4593
01:12:58,239 --> 01:12:59,910
book several hundred years before i
think we'd get there

4594
01:12:59,910 --> 01:12:59,920
think we'd get there
 

4595
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,590
think we'd get there
it's interesting because we're also

4596
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:01,600
it's interesting because we're also
 

4597
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,510
it's interesting because we're also
exploring

4598
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,520
exploring
 

4599
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,830
exploring
ways to motivate

4600
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:05,840
ways to motivate
 

4601
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,870
ways to motivate
society to take on this challenge

4602
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:08,880
society to take on this challenge
 

4603
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,950
society to take on this challenge
it's the jfk thing

4604
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:10,960
it's the jfk thing
 

4605
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,550
it's the jfk thing
and then the cold war that inspired

4606
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
and then the cold war that inspired
 

4607
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,870
and then the cold war that inspired

01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:56,719
versus new york city and i'll be there's
 

4767
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,709
versus new york city and i'll be there's
a big nasally accent you know yeah and

4768
01:15:58,709 --> 01:15:58,719
a big nasally accent you know yeah and
 

4769
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:00,310
a big nasally accent you know yeah and
uh the people will just get or even

4770
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:00,320
uh the people will just get or even
 

4771
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,990
uh the people will just get or even
wisconsin i'm from wisconsin i'll be

4772
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
wisconsin i'm from wisconsin i'll be
 

4773
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,669
wisconsin i'm from wisconsin i'll be
able to speak nasally town welcome to

4774
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
able to speak nasally town welcome to
 

4775
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:06,229
able to speak nasally town welcome to
wisconsin and minnesota

4776
01:16:06,229 --> 01:16:06,239
wisconsin and minnesota
 

4777
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:07,910
wisconsin and minnesota
i wonder who defines that culture

4778
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:07,920
i wonder who defines that culture
 

4779
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:08,790
i wonder who defines that culture
because

4780
01:16:08,790 --> 01:16:08,800
because
 

4781
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,910
because
it's very likely that the early humans

4782
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:11,920
it's very likely that the early humans
 

4783
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,550
it's very likely that the early humans
on mars will be very technically savvy

4784
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:14,560
on mars will be very technically savvy
 

4785
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,310
on mars will be very technically savvy
yeah they have to be engineering

4786
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320
yeah they have to be engineering
 

4787
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,229
yeah they have to be engineering
challenges well actually i don't know it

4788
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:18,239
challenges well actually i don't know it
 

4789
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,709
challenges well actually i don't know it
could be the this has to do with your

4790
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:20,719
could be the this has to do with your
 

4791
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,870
could be the this has to do with your
extreme microbiome it's like is it going

4792
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:22,880
extreme microbiome it's like is it going
 

4793
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,910
extreme microbiome it's like is it going
to be

4794
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:23,920
to be
 

4795
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,350
to be
the extreme survivalists or is it going

4796
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
the extreme survivalists or is it going
 

4797
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,229
the extreme survivalists or is it going
to be

4798
01:16:28,229 --> 01:16:28,239
to be
 

4799
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:29,830
to be
the engineers and scientists or is it

4800
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
the engineers and scientists or is it
 

4801
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,110
the engineers and scientists or is it
going to be both

4802
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:31,120
going to be both
 

4803
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,709
going to be both
because my experience the scientists

4804
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
because my experience the scientists
 

4805
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,430
because my experience the scientists
they're you know they like the comfort

4806
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
they're you know they like the comfort
 

4807
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,550
they're you know they like the comfort
of their

4808
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:36,560
of their
 

4809
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,030
of their
the lab yes they don't well no there's

4810
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:39,040
the lab yes they don't well no there's
 

4811
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,630
the lab yes they don't well no there's
some i keep contradicting myself

4812
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:40,640
some i keep contradicting myself
 

4813
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,470
some i keep contradicting myself
non-stop there's some badass scientists

4814
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
non-stop there's some badass scientists
 

4815
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,470
non-stop there's some badass scientists
that travel to like antarctica and all

4816
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:44,480
that travel to like antarctica and all
 

4817
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,830
that travel to like antarctica and all
that kind of stuff so it's an

4818
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:45,840
that kind of stuff so it's an
 

4819
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,750
that kind of stuff so it's an
evolutionary selection for humans who

4820
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:47,760
evolutionary selection for humans who
 

4821
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,189
evolutionary selection for humans who
can stare at a screen for eight hours at

4822
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:49,199
can stare at a screen for eight hours at
 

4823
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,270
can stare at a screen for eight hours at
a time or pipette for 12 hours at a time

4824
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,280
a time or pipette for 12 hours at a time
 

4825
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,110
a time or pipette for 12 hours at a time
and not talk to anybody so it's not

4826
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:53,120
and not talk to anybody so it's not
 

4827
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,870
and not talk to anybody so it's not
surprising when our scientists are a

4828
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
surprising when our scientists are a
 

4829
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,110
surprising when our scientists are a
little bit awkward in social situations

4830
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
little bit awkward in social situations
 

4831
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,110
little bit awkward in social situations
but we can we can get we can train them

4832
01:16:59,110 --> 01:16:59,120
but we can we can get we can train them
 

4833
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,229
but we can we can get we can train them
out of that we can get them to engage

4834
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239
out of that we can get them to engage
 

4835
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,470
out of that we can get them to engage
other humans uh not all of them but uh

4836
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,480
other humans uh not all of them but uh
 

4837
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,709
other humans uh not all of them but uh
hopefully most of them

4838
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
hopefully most of them
 

4839
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,229
hopefully most of them
so i think you know i think the culture

4840
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:06,239
so i think you know i think the culture
 

4841
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:07,590
so i think you know i think the culture
will definitely be different there'll be

4842
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:07,600
will definitely be different there'll be
 

4843
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,950
will definitely be different there'll be
different dialects different foods

4844
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:08,960
different dialects different foods
 

4845
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,390
different dialects different foods
there'll be different

4846
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,400
there'll be different
 

4847
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,229
there'll be different
values so very likely would be a

4848
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
values so very likely would be a
 

4849
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,990
values so very likely would be a
different religion kim stanley robinson

4850
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:14,000
different religion kim stanley robinson
 

4851
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,910
different religion kim stanley robinson
wrote a lot about this in his books

4852
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:15,920
wrote a lot about this in his books
 

4853
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,189
wrote a lot about this in his books
the new martian religion that was

4854
01:17:17,189 --> 01:17:17,199
the new martian religion that was
 

4855
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:18,550
the new martian religion that was
created so i think this idea has been

4856
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:18,560
created so i think this idea has been
 

4857
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,630
created so i think this idea has been
discussed in the in science fiction

4858
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
discussed in the in science fiction
 

4859
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:22,310
discussed in the in science fiction
and it is almost unavoidable because

4860
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:22,320
and it is almost unavoidable because
 

4861
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,310
and it is almost unavoidable because
there's been i mean just just think of

4862
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
there's been i mean just just think of
 

4863
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,430
there's been i mean just just think of
all the religions that have happened on

4864
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,440
all the religions that have happened on
 

4865
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,790
all the religions that have happened on
earth um

4866
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:26,800
earth um
 

4867
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:27,590
earth um
with

4868
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
with
 

4869
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,750
with
with you know very little

4870
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:29,760
with you know very little
 

4871
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,510
with you know very little
i think uh

4872
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,520
i think uh
 

4873
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:33,030
i think uh
dr dr i mean there's just terrestrial

4874
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
dr dr i mean there's just terrestrial
 

4875
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,790
dr dr i mean there's just terrestrial
drama but suddenly you have a different

4876
01:17:34,790 --> 01:17:34,800
drama but suddenly you have a different
 

4877
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,590
drama but suddenly you have a different
planet and you then need a deity that

4878
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:37,600
planet and you then need a deity that
 

4879
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,270
planet and you then need a deity that
would span multiple planets and i don't

4880
01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:39,280
would span multiple planets and i don't
 

4881
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,310
would span multiple planets and i don't
even know how you do that but i think

4882
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:40,320
even know how you do that but i think
 

4883
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,910
even know how you do that but i think
someone will think of a way

4884
01:17:41,910 --> 01:17:41,920
someone will think of a way
 

4885
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,830
someone will think of a way
and make up something

4886
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:43,840
and make up something
 

4887
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,070
and make up something
yeah that's uh

4888
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:46,080
yeah that's uh
 

4889
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,510
yeah that's uh
look for ways to draw meaning

4890
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:49,520
look for ways to draw meaning
 

4891
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,790
look for ways to draw meaning
so religion for a lot of people myths

4892
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
so religion for a lot of people myths
 

4893
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,110
so religion for a lot of people myths
common ideas are a source of meaning and

4894
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:55,120
common ideas are a source of meaning and
 

4895
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,310
common ideas are a source of meaning and
when you're on another planet

4896
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:58,320
when you're on another planet
 

4897
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,350
when you're on another planet
boy

4898
01:17:59,350 --> 01:17:59,360

does the sense

4900
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:00,880
does the sense
 

4901
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,030
does the sense
of what is meaningful change

4902
01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:03,040
of what is meaningful change
 

4903
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,229
of what is meaningful change
because you're

4904
01:18:04,229 --> 01:18:04,239
because you're
 

4905
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:05,830
because you're
it's humbling

4906
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
it's humbling
 

4907
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,350
it's humbling
the harshness of the conditions is

4908
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:07,360
the harshness of the conditions is
 

4909
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:08,310
the harshness of the conditions is
humbling

4910
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:08,320
humbling
 

4911
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,750
humbling
the the

4912

the the
 

4913
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,390
the the
very practical fact that earth from

4914
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:12,400
very practical fact that earth from
 

4915
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,790
very practical fact that earth from
which you came is not so special because

4916
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:14,800
which you came is not so special because
 

4917
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,870
which you came is not so special because
you're clearly not on earth currently

4918

you're clearly not on earth currently
 

4919
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,310
you're clearly not on earth currently
and you're doing fine

4920
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:18,320
and you're doing fine
 

4921
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,149
and you're doing fine
and you made it at some point i mean

4922
01:18:20,149 --> 01:18:20,159
and you made it at some point i mean
 

4923
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,149
and you made it at some point i mean
it'll be pretty harsh like like what

4924
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:22,159
it'll be pretty harsh like like what

it people died actually he didn't
 

4933
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,669
it people died actually he didn't
believe in scurvy at the time so he

4934
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:31,679
believe in scurvy at the time so he
 

4935
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,110
believe in scurvy at the time so he
didn't take enough vitamin c and some of

his people died from not having vitamin
 

4939

5082
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
it actually looks like you can go back
 

5083
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,110
it actually looks like you can go back
into the microwave you didn't get fully

5084
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:45,120
into the microwave you didn't get fully
 

5085
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,310
into the microwave you didn't get fully
cooked you can go a little bit farther

5086
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:46,320
cooked you can go a little bit farther
 

5087
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,669
cooked you can go a little bit farther
so for the polaris mission they're going

5088
01:20:47,669 --> 01:20:47,679
so for the polaris mission they're going
 

5089
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:49,430
so for the polaris mission they're going
to go even farther

5090
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:49,440
to go even farther
 

5091
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,950
to go even farther
uh and then also

5092
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:50,960
uh and then also
 

5093
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,149
uh and then also
open the hatch and go on these new

5094
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:52,159
open the hatch and go on these new
 

5095
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:53,990
open the hatch and go on these new
spacesuits that spacex is designing

5096
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,000
spacesuits that spacex is designing
 

5097
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,830
spacesuits that spacex is designing
that'll be much nimbler not as much of a

5098
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,840
that'll be much nimbler not as much of a
 

5099
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,669
that'll be much nimbler not as much of a
giant you know

5100
01:20:57,669 --> 01:20:57,679
giant you know
 

5101
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:00,470
giant you know
dr octagon kind of uh spacesuit but

5102
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:00,480
dr octagon kind of uh spacesuit but
 

5103
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,070
dr octagon kind of uh spacesuit but
really

5104
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:02,080
really
 

5105
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,350
really
like looks like just a nice spacesuit

5106
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,360
like looks like just a nice spacesuit
 

5107
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,390
like looks like just a nice spacesuit
they're gonna go out into the vacuum of

5108
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,400
they're gonna go out into the vacuum of
 

5109
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,350
they're gonna go out into the vacuum of
space

5110
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,360
space
 

5111
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,550
space
and so you know pushing all the

5112
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
and so you know pushing all the
 

5113
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,629
and so you know pushing all the
engineering uh for these missions which

5114
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:08,639
engineering uh for these missions which
 

5115
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,550
engineering uh for these missions which
are privately funded so it's it's people

5116
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,560
are privately funded so it's it's people
 

5117
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,990
are privately funded so it's it's people
who just say i want to go up in space

5118
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:12,000
who just say i want to go up in space
 

5119
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,669
who just say i want to go up in space
and see if i can push the limits has

5120
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:13,679
and see if i can push the limits has
 

5121
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,189
and see if i can push the limits has
been fabulous but i think the most

5122
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
been fabulous but i think the most
 

5123
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:16,870
been fabulous but i think the most
fabulous part is is jared in particular

i want all of your cells you know but
 

5159
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,189
i want all of your cells you know but
but it's true because there's so much we

5160
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:49,199
but it's true because there's so much we
 

5161
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,070
but it's true because there's so much we
don't know

01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:54,719
doing it you know with nasa astronauts
 

5169
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:56,950
doing it you know with nasa astronauts
but it's been suddenly this influx of

5170
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:56,960
but it's been suddenly this influx of
 

5171
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,149
but it's been suddenly this influx of
new crews that are willing to do almost

5172
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:00,159
new crews that are willing to do almost
 

5173
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,669
new crews that are willing to do almost
anything right so including we did skin

5174
01:22:01,669 --> 01:22:01,679
anything right so including we did skin
 

5175
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:03,590
anything right so including we did skin
biopsies for the inspiration for crew

5176
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
biopsies for the inspiration for crew
 

5177
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,510
biopsies for the inspiration for crew
before and after space flight and that's

5178
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:05,520
before and after space flight and that's
 

5179
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,790
before and after space flight and that's
never been done before we've never seen

5180
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800
never been done before we've never seen
 

5181
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,550
never been done before we've never seen
the structure of the skin and how it

5182
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:08,560
the structure of the skin and how it
 

5183
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,310
the structure of the skin and how it
changes in response to microgravity and

5184
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:10,320
changes in response to microgravity and
 

5185
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:12,310
changes in response to microgravity and
also the microbes that change and so

5186
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:12,320
also the microbes that change and so
 

5187
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,229
also the microbes that change and so
these beautiful images of even the

5188
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:14,239
these beautiful images of even the
 

5189
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,510
these beautiful images of even the
structure of skin changing and the

5190
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:15,520
structure of skin changing and the
 

5191
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,030
structure of skin changing and the
inflammation that we've seen in like for

5192
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:17,040
inflammation that we've seen in like for
 

5193
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:19,270
inflammation that we've seen in like for
scott kelly for example we now have a

5194
01:22:19,270 --> 01:22:19,280
scott kelly for example we now have a
 

5195
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,189
scott kelly for example we now have a
molecule by molecule map of what happens

5196
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
molecule by molecule map of what happens
 

5197
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,229
molecule by molecule map of what happens
to skin

5198
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:22,239
to skin
 

5199
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:23,590
to skin
which has never been done before so

5200
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,600
which has never been done before so
 

5201
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,870
which has never been done before so
there what are interesting surprises

5202
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:24,880
there what are interesting surprises
 

5203
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,350
there what are interesting surprises
there so one of the things we can see

5204
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
there so one of the things we can see
 

5205
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,790
there so one of the things we can see
the part what's driving inflammation is

5206
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
the part what's driving inflammation is
 

5207
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,870
the part what's driving inflammation is
we can actually see macrophages there's

5208
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:30,880
we can actually see macrophages there's
 

5209
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,790
we can actually see macrophages there's
other dendritic cells pieces like cells

5210
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:32,800
other dendritic cells pieces like cells
 

5211
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,390
other dendritic cells pieces like cells
that are part of the immune system kind

5212
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:34,400
that are part of the immune system kind
 

5213
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,990
that are part of the immune system kind
of creeping along towards the surface of

5214
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,000
of creeping along towards the surface of
 

5215
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,669
of creeping along towards the surface of
the skin which is now we know it's

5216
01:22:37,669 --> 01:22:37,679
the skin which is now we know it's
 

5217
01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:38,950
the skin which is now we know it's
actually physically driving the immune

5218
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:38,960
actually physically driving the immune
 

5219
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:41,030
actually physically driving the immune
system is these cells going and creating

5220
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:41,040
system is these cells going and creating
 

5221
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,629
system is these cells going and creating
this inflammation which is what leads to

5222
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:42,639
this inflammation which is what leads to
 

5223
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,310
this inflammation which is what leads to
some of the rashes but we didn't see as

5224
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:44,320
some of the rashes but we didn't see as
 

5225
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,310
some of the rashes but we didn't see as
much in them as we saw for example some

5226
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,320
much in them as we saw for example some
 

5227
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,470
much in them as we saw for example some
of the signatures of scott kelly so

5228
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:48,480
of the signatures of scott kelly so
 

5229
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,390
of the signatures of scott kelly so
we can see within the crew who's getting

5230
01:22:50,390 --> 01:22:50,400
we can see within the crew who's getting
 

5231
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,990
we can see within the crew who's getting
more of a rash or not or who didn't

5232
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
more of a rash or not or who didn't
 

5233
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,430
more of a rash or not or who didn't
experience any rash

5234
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:53,440
experience any rash
 

5235
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,870
experience any rash
and some people had

5236
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:54,880
and some people had
 

5237
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:56,629
and some people had

schuffner you have to do training for

5316
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
schuffner you have to do training for
 

5317
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,790
schuffner you have to do training for
some of the russian modules

probably going to be done first

5376
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
probably going to be done first
 

5377
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:54,950
probably going to be done first
but the

5378
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:54,960
but the
 

5379
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,270
but the
the extraordinary thing is

5380
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
the extraordinary thing is
 

5381
01:24:57,280 --> 01:24:58,870
the extraordinary thing is
uh the there's

5382
01:24:58,870 --> 01:24:58,880
uh the there's
 

5383
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,229
uh the there's
unfortunately there's no collaboration

5384
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:00,239
unfortunately there's no collaboration
 

5385
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:02,149
unfortunately there's no collaboration
between the you see that as a negative

5386
01:25:02,149 --> 01:25:02,159
between the you see that as a negative
 

5387
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:03,350
between the you see that as a negative
that's not the positive kind of

5388
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:03,360
that's not the positive kind of
 

5389
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,750
that's not the positive kind of
competition it's it's a good question so

5390
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:05,760
competition it's it's a good question so
 

5391
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,030
competition it's it's a good question so
maybe

5392
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,040

reason in my mind i was thinking 10 20
 

5507
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:58,629
reason in my mind i was thinking 10 20
years from now

5508
01:26:58,629 --> 01:26:58,639
years from now
 

5509
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,430
years from now
and then i realized like wait why not

01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:01,440
and then i realized like wait why not
 

5511

like now
 

5513
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:05,030
like now
yeah there's no

5514
01:27:05,030 --> 01:27:05,040
yeah there's no
 

5515
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,270
yeah there's no
just even seeing what uh axiom is doing

5516
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,280
just even seeing what uh axiom is doing
 

5517
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,950
just even seeing what uh axiom is doing
what inspiration four is doing it's like

5518
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:08,960
what inspiration four is doing it's like
 

5519
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,590
what inspiration four is doing it's like
regular civilians could just start going

5520
01:27:11,590 --> 01:27:11,600
regular civilians could just start going
 

5521
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,550
regular civilians could just start going
up

5522
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:12,560
up
 

5523
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,229
up
well so let me ask you this question

5524
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:14,239
well so let me ask you this question
 

5525
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:16,470
well so let me ask you this question
when do you think we saw jeff bezos go

5526
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
when do you think we saw jeff bezos go
 

5527
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,870
when do you think we saw jeff bezos go
on to orbit what do you think elon goes

5528
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:18,880
on to orbit what do you think elon goes
 

5529
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,550
on to orbit what do you think elon goes
up to space

5530
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
up to space
 

5531
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,669
up to space
so

5532
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:21,679
so
 

5533
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:24,709
so
his thinking about this is it's

5534
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:24,719
his thinking about this is it's
 

5535
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:27,030
his thinking about this is it's
partially responsible until it's safe

5536
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:27,040
partially responsible until it's safe
 

5537
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,350
partially responsible until it's safe
because he has such a

5538
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:29,360
because he has such a
 

5539
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,070
because he has such a
direct engineering roles in the running

5540
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:32,080
direct engineering roles in the running
 

5541
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,550
direct engineering roles in the running
of multiple companies

5542
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
of multiple companies
 

5543
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,790
of multiple companies
so at which point do you think what's

5544
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:36,800
so at which point do you think what's
 

5545
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,310
so at which point do you think what's
your prediction for the year that elon

5546
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:38,320
your prediction for the year that elon
 

5547
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:39,830
your prediction for the year that elon
will go up

5548
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
will go up
 

5549
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,830
will go up
i think you probably go up by 2026

5550
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:43,840
i think you probably go up by 2026
 

5551
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,110
i think you probably go up by 2026
i would say

5552
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:45,120
i would say
 

5553
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,590
i would say
because the number of missions planned

5554
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
because the number of missions planned
 

5555
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:50,310
because the number of missions planned
there'll be pr several missions per year

5556
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:50,320
there'll be pr several missions per year
 

5557
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,709
there'll be pr several missions per year
through multiple space agencies and

5558
01:27:52,709 --> 01:27:52,719
through multiple space agencies and
 

5559
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:54,470
through multiple space agencies and
companies that are really

5560
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
companies that are really
 

5561
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:57,189
companies that are really
making low-earth orbit very routine

5562
01:27:57,189 --> 01:27:57,199
making low-earth orbit very routine
 

5563
01:27:57,199 --> 01:27:58,870
making low-earth orbit very routine
and by go up i think it might also for

5564
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:58,880
and by go up i think it might also for
 

5565
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,629
and by go up i think it might also for
example the inspiration for mission just

5566
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:00,639
example the inspiration for mission just
 

5567
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,149
example the inspiration for mission just
went up for three days in flight you

5568
01:28:02,149 --> 01:28:02,159
went up for three days in flight you
 

5569
01:28:02,159 --> 01:28:03,669
went up for three days in flight you
know it was enough time to get up there

5570
01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:03,679
know it was enough time to get up there
 

5571
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,149
know it was enough time to get up there
do some experiments enjoy the view and

5572
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:06,159
do some experiments enjoy the view and
 

5573
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,990
do some experiments enjoy the view and
then you came back the axiom emissions

5574
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:08,000
then you came back the axiom emissions
 

5575
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:08,870
then you came back the axiom emissions
are a bit more complicated there's

5576
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:08,880
are a bit more complicated there's
 

5577
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:10,310
are a bit more complicated there's
docking up in the space station it's a

5578
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
docking up in the space station it's a
 

5579
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,229
docking up in the space station it's a
shared atmosphere so you have to follow

5580
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:12,239
shared atmosphere so you have to follow
 

5581
01:28:12,239 --> 01:28:14,550
shared atmosphere so you have to follow
all the iss protocols what's what's

5582
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:14,560
all the iss protocols what's what's
 

5583
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,070
all the iss protocols what's what's
interesting about the dragon capsule and

5584
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
interesting about the dragon capsule and
 

5585
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,750
interesting about the dragon capsule and
the inspiration for and some of these

5586
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:17,760
the inspiration for and some of these
 

5587
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,669
the inspiration for and some of these
what are called free flyer missions you

5588
01:28:19,669 --> 01:28:19,679
what are called free flyer missions you
 

5589
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:20,870
what are called free flyer missions you
can just launch into space you basically

5590
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:20,880
can just launch into space you basically
 

5591
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,229
can just launch into space you basically
have your own little mini space station

5592
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:22,239
have your own little mini space station
 

5593
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:24,070
have your own little mini space station
for a few days it's not that big right

5594
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:24,080
for a few days it's not that big right
 

5595
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:25,750
for a few days it's not that big right
but i think that's what we'd probably

5596
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:25,760
but i think that's what we'd probably
 

5597
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,830
but i think that's what we'd probably
see him do first because they're fair

5598
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:27,840
see him do first because they're fair
 

5599
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:28,870
see him do first because they're fair
you know we're going to see a lot more

5600
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:28,880
you know we're going to see a lot more
 

5601
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,390
you know we're going to see a lot more
tests of those in the next three to

5602
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:30,400
tests of those in the next three to
 

5603
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,510
tests of those in the next three to
three years

5604
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:31,520
three years
 

5605
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,950
three years
but they're

5606
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:32,960
but they're
 

5607
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,310
but they're
already been demonstrated to be safe and

5608
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:34,320
already been demonstrated to be safe and
 

5609
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,750
already been demonstrated to be safe and
then you're not trying to go for 10 to

5610
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:35,760
then you're not trying to go for 10 to
 

5611
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,310
then you're not trying to go for 10 to
20 days or months or years at a time

5612
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:38,320
20 days or months or years at a time
 

5613

20 days or months or years at a time
it's just up in space for a few days but

5614
01:28:40,070 --> 01:28:40,080
it's just up in space for a few days but
 

5615
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,669
it's just up in space for a few days but
you're in proper space it's an orbital

5616
01:28:41,669 --> 01:28:41,679
you're in proper space it's an orbital

you're um you could do the podcast from

5620
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:45,280
you're um you could do the podcast from
 

5621
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:47,590
you're um you could do the podcast from
there and i think 2026 i wonder how the

5622
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:47,600
there and i think 2026 i wonder how the
 

5623
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,950
there and i think 2026 i wonder how the
audio works

5624
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:48,960
audio works
 

5625
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,669
audio works
see also can you comment on 2026 i'll

5626

see also can you comment on 2026 i'll
 

5627
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:53,510
see also can you comment on 2026 i'll
i'll start getting ready

5628
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:53,520
i'll start getting ready
 

5629
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,270
i'll start getting ready
i'll start pushing him on this i'm quite

5630
01:28:55,270 --> 01:28:55,280
i'll start pushing him on this i'm quite
 

5631
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:57,030
i'll start pushing him on this i'm quite
quite serious it's a fascinating kind of

01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:57,040
quite serious it's a fascinating kind of

axiom two still has room you could go on

5634
01:28:58,709 --> 01:28:58,719
axiom two still has room you could go on
 

5635
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:00,229
axiom two still has room you could go on
that mission if you want consistency so

5636
01:29:00,229 --> 01:29:00,239
that mission if you want consistency so
 

5637
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:03,189
that mission if you want consistency so
i'll ask you about axiom um

5638
01:29:03,189 --> 01:29:03,199
i'll ask you about axiom um
 

5639
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:04,229
i'll ask you about axiom um
what

5640
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
what
 

5641
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,310
what
how strict are these

5642
01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:06,320
how strict are these
 

5643
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,110
how strict are these
so

5644
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:07,120
so
 

5645
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,990
so
this this seems surreal that civilians

5646
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
this this seems surreal that civilians
 

5647
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,910
this this seems surreal that civilians
are traveling up so

5648
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:11,920
are traveling up so
 

5649
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,750
are traveling up so
how many how much bureaucracies there's

5650
01:29:13,750 --> 01:29:13,760
how many how much bureaucracies there's
 

5651
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,590
how many how much bureaucracies there's
still in your experience for the

5652
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:15,600
still in your experience for the
 

5653
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,950
still in your experience for the
scientific i mean i know it's a

5654
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:16,960
scientific i mean i know it's a
 

5655
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:19,110
scientific i mean i know it's a
difficult question to ask a scientist

5656
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:19,120
difficult question to ask a scientist
 

5657
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:20,310
difficult question to ask a scientist
because you get to

5658
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:20,320
because you get to
 

5659
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,590
because you get to
you know you don't want to complain too

5660
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:21,600
you know you don't want to complain too
 

5661
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,110
you know you don't want to complain too
much

5662
01:29:23,110 --> 01:29:23,120
much
 

5663
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,430
much
but how much you know there's sometimes

5664
01:29:25,430 --> 01:29:25,440
but how much you know there's sometimes
 

5665
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:27,590
but how much you know there's sometimes
bureaucracy with nsf and the od and the

5666
01:29:27,590 --> 01:29:27,600
bureaucracy with nsf and the od and the
 

5667
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,750
bureaucracy with nsf and the od and the
funding and all those kinds of things

5668
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:29,760
funding and all those kinds of things
 

5669
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,270
funding and all those kinds of things
um that kind of prevent you from

5670
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:33,280
um that kind of prevent you from
 

5671
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,110
um that kind of prevent you from
being as free as you might sometimes

5672
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,120
being as free as you might sometimes
 

5673
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,950
being as free as you might sometimes
like to to do all kinds of wild

5674
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:36,960
like to to do all kinds of wild
 

5675
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,030
like to to do all kinds of wild
experiments and crazy experiments now

5676
01:29:39,030 --> 01:29:39,040
experiments and crazy experiments now
 

5677
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,390
experiments and crazy experiments now
the benefit

5678
01:29:40,390 --> 01:29:40,400
the benefit
 

5679
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,790
the benefit
of that is that you don't do any wild

5680
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:42,800
of that is that you don't do any wild
 

5681
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,709
of that is that you don't do any wild
and crazy experiments that hurt people

5682
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:44,719
and crazy experiments that hurt people
 

5683
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:46,310
and crazy experiments that hurt people
right right and so it's very important

5684
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:46,320
right right and so it's very important
 

5685
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:49,110
right right and so it's very important
to put safety first but it's like a

5686
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120
to put safety first but it's like a
 

5687
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,510
to put safety first but it's like a
dance a little too much restrictions the

5688
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:51,520
dance a little too much restrictions the
 

5689
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,470
dance a little too much restrictions the
bureaucracy

5690
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,480
bureaucracy
 

5691
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,110
bureaucracy
can hamper the flourishing of science a

5692
01:29:55,110 --> 01:29:55,120
can hamper the flourishing of science a
 

5693
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:57,189
can hamper the flourishing of science a
little too little of that

5694
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:57,199
little too little of that
 

5695
01:29:57,199 --> 01:29:59,430
little too little of that
can get some crazy scientists to start

5696
01:29:59,430 --> 01:29:59,440
can get some crazy scientists to start
 

5697
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,590
can get some crazy scientists to start
doing unethical experiments okay that

5698
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:01,600
doing unethical experiments okay that
 

5699

mixed martial arts is a pretty safe

5720
01:30:22,870 --> 01:30:22,880
mixed martial arts is a pretty safe
 

5721
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,110
mixed martial arts is a pretty safe
activity unless you're doing uh the

5722
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,120
activity unless you're doing uh the
 

5723
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,270
activity unless you're doing uh the
octagon version of your podcast i mean

5724
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,280
octagon version of your podcast i mean
 

5725
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:28,709
octagon version of your podcast i mean
just getting there and back is the only

5726
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:28,719
just getting there and back is the only
 

5727
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:31,189
just getting there and back is the only
real risky part which is still risky

5728
01:30:31,189 --> 01:30:31,199
real risky part which is still risky
 

5729
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:33,270
real risky part which is still risky
right but i think you're not asking me

5730
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,280
right but i think you're not asking me
 

5731
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:34,870
right but i think you're not asking me
to do you know open heart surgery in

5732
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:34,880
to do you know open heart surgery in
 

5733
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,390
to do you know open heart surgery in
space you're just saying what if i do a

5734
01:30:36,390 --> 01:30:36,400
space you're just saying what if i do a
 

5735
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,870
space you're just saying what if i do a
podcast and i think well fun you're

5736
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:38,880
podcast and i think well fun you're
 

5737
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,110
podcast and i think well fun you're
trying to ask to have fun yes and i feel

5738
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:41,120
trying to ask to have fun yes and i feel
 

5739
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:43,830
trying to ask to have fun yes and i feel
like fun sounds dangerous any kind of

5740
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:43,840
like fun sounds dangerous any kind of
 

5741
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,229
like fun sounds dangerous any kind of
fun ah that's what's been extraordinary

5742
01:30:46,229 --> 01:30:46,239
fun ah that's what's been extraordinary
 

5743
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:48,790
fun ah that's what's been extraordinary
is that traditionally yes i think

5744
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:48,800
is that traditionally yes i think
 

5745
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,709
is that traditionally yes i think
most the space agencies have been very

5746
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:50,719
most the space agencies have been very
 

5747
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:52,229
most the space agencies have been very
by definition bureaucratic because

5748
01:30:52,229 --> 01:30:52,239
by definition bureaucratic because
 

5749
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:53,910
by definition bureaucratic because
they're coming from the government

5750
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:53,920
they're coming from the government
 

5751
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,510
they're coming from the government
and but they've been been that way for a

5752
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:55,520
and but they've been been that way for a
 

5753
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,590
and but they've been been that way for a
really good reason is that safety

5754
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:57,600
really good reason is that safety
 

5755
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,350
really good reason is that safety
you know in the early 60s we know almost

5756
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360
you know in the early 60s we know almost
 

5757
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,510
you know in the early 60s we know almost
nothing about the body in space

5758
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:01,520
nothing about the body in space
 

5759
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:02,629
nothing about the body in space
except for you know some of the work

5760
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:02,639
except for you know some of the work
 

5761
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:03,830
except for you know some of the work
that pilots had done at really high

5762
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:03,840
that pilots had done at really high
 

5763
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,030
that pilots had done at really high
altitudes so we really didn't know what

5764
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,040
altitudes so we really didn't know what
 

5765
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,110
altitudes so we really didn't know what
at all to expect so it's good that there

5766
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:07,120
at all to expect so it's good that there
 

5767
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,990
at all to expect so it's good that there
were decades of resolute focus on just

5768
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:10,000
were decades of resolute focus on just
 

5769
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,550
were decades of resolute focus on just
safety but now we know it's pretty safe

5770
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:12,560
safety but now we know it's pretty safe
 

5771
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,990
safety but now we know it's pretty safe
we know this physiological response is

5772
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
we know this physiological response is
 

5773
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,590
we know this physiological response is
we know what to expect we can also treat

5774
01:31:15,590 --> 01:31:15,600
we know what to expect we can also treat
 

5775
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,430
we know what to expect we can also treat
some of it but hopefully hopefully soon

5776
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:17,440
some of it but hopefully hopefully soon
 

5777
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,110
some of it but hopefully hopefully soon
we'll treat a lot more of it

5778
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:19,120
we'll treat a lot more of it
 

5779
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,149
we'll treat a lot more of it
but

5780
01:31:20,149 --> 01:31:20,159
but
 

5781
01:31:20,159 --> 01:31:21,270
but
if you just want to go up there it's

5782
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:21,280
if you just want to go up there it's
 

5783
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,550
if you just want to go up there it's
actually now it's just a question of

5784
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:22,560
actually now it's just a question of
 

5785
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,310
actually now it's just a question of
cost like imagine

5786
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:24,320
cost like imagine
 

5787
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,669
cost like imagine
i think the way you can view a lot of

5788
01:31:25,669 --> 01:31:25,679
i think the way you can view a lot of
 

5789
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:27,590
i think the way you can view a lot of
the commercial space flight companies is

5790
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:27,600
the commercial space flight companies is
 

5791
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,750
the commercial space flight companies is
that if you have the funds you can

5792
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:29,760
that if you have the funds you can
 

5793
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,189
that if you have the funds you can
basically plan the mission all the

5794
01:31:31,189 --> 01:31:31,199
basically plan the mission all the
 

5795
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:32,629
basically plan the mission all the
training they'll do is to help you get

5796
01:31:32,629 --> 01:31:32,639
training they'll do is to help you get
 

5797
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:34,470
training they'll do is to help you get
prepared for how you run some of the

5798
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:34,480
prepared for how you run some of the
 

5799
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:35,910
prepared for how you run some of the
instrumentation how you can fly the

rocket to the limited degree and how to
use some of the equipment but

5804
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:39,760
use some of the equipment but
 

5805
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,990
use some of the equipment but
fundamentally it's no longer a question

01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,000
fundamentally it's no longer a question
 

5807
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:42,790
fundamentally it's no longer a question
of

5808
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:42,800
of
 

5809
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:43,990
of
years and years of training and

5810
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:44,000
years and years of training and
 

5811
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,149
years and years of training and

becoming an astronaut
 

5815
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:49,990
becoming an astronaut
it's frankly just a question of funds

5816
01:31:49,990 --> 01:31:50,000
it's frankly just a question of funds
 

5817
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,149
it's frankly just a question of funds
expensive plane rides so how much how

5818
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:52,159
expensive plane rides so how much how
 

5819
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:55,030
expensive plane rides so how much how
much you mention axiom well is it known

5820
01:31:55,030 --> 01:31:55,040
much you mention axiom well is it known
 

5821
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:57,669
much you mention axiom well is it known
how much the it costs

5822
01:31:57,669 --> 01:31:57,679
how much the it costs
 

5823
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:00,149
how much the it costs
for the plane ride there is no official

5824
01:32:00,149 --> 01:32:00,159
for the plane ride there is no official
 

5825
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,229
for the plane ride there is no official
number and it depends on the mission of

5826
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:02,239
number and it depends on the mission of
 

5827
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,629
number and it depends on the mission of
course so the if you ask them well often

5828
01:32:04,629 --> 01:32:04,639
course so the if you ask them well often
 

5829
01:32:04,639 --> 01:32:05,990
course so the if you ask them well often
they'll say well how serious are you

5830
01:32:05,990 --> 01:32:06,000
they'll say well how serious are you
 

5831
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:06,870
they'll say well how serious are you
they really want they don't just want to

5832
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:06,880
they really want they don't just want to
 

5833
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,709
they really want they don't just want to
give out random numbers to people right

5834
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
give out random numbers to people right
 

5835
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,310
give out random numbers to people right
uh but the numbers

5836
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:10,320
uh but the numbers
 

5837
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,590
uh but the numbers
because for example we propose one

01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:15,990
we want a new twin study where someone
goes up and stays up there for 500 to

goes up and stays up there for 500 to
 

5845
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,910
goes up and stays up there for 500 to
550 days to basically be up there for

5846
01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:17,920
550 days to basically be up there for
 

5847
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:19,669
550 days to basically be up there for
the longest time ever to simulate the

01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:19,679
the longest time ever to simulate the
 

5849
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:21,110
the longest time ever to simulate the
time it would take to get to mars and

back for the shortest possible duration
 

5853

back for the shortest possible duration
about 550 days

5854
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:24,719
about 550 days
 

5855
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:25,430
about 550 days
because if you went there and

5856
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:25,440
because if you went there and
 

5857
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:26,709
because if you went there and
immediately turned around you could

5858
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:26,719
immediately turned around you could
 

5859
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,070
immediately turned around you could

the
and there we go you know it's you're

5866
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:31,840
and there we go you know it's you're
 

5867
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:34,070
and there we go you know it's you're
looking at the ranges of you know it's

5868
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:34,080
looking at the ranges of you know it's
 

5869
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,070
looking at the ranges of you know it's
50 to 100 million dollars in that

5870
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:36,080
50 to 100 million dollars in that
 

5871
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,229
50 to 100 million dollars in that
ballpark range but the reason it's so

5872
01:32:38,229 --> 01:32:38,239
ballpark range but the reason it's so
 

5873
01:32:38,239 --> 01:32:39,590
ballpark range but the reason it's so
variable is it depends what are you

5874
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:39,600
variable is it depends what are you
 

5875
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,870
variable is it depends what are you
doing up there if you're up there for

5876
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:40,880
doing up there if you're up there for
 

5877
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,590
doing up there if you're up there for
example for two two years basically

5878
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:43,600
example for two two years basically
 

5879
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,669
example for two two years basically
almost almost two years

5880
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
almost almost two years
 

5881
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:46,950
almost almost two years
that's a long time just being in one

5882
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:46,960
that's a long time just being in one
 

5883
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,709
that's a long time just being in one
spot right so could you be doing some

5884
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719
spot right so could you be doing some
 

5885
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:50,310
spot right so could you be doing some
things where you're yeah it's you can

5886
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:50,320
things where you're yeah it's you can
 

5887
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:51,430
things where you're yeah it's you can
your time is valuable so you can do

5888
01:32:51,430 --> 01:32:51,440
your time is valuable so you can do
 

5889
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,870
your time is valuable so you can do
experiments and people pay for those and

5890
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:52,880
experiments and people pay for those and
 

5891
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,590
experiments and people pay for those and
that defrays the cost or you could build

5892
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:55,600
that defrays the cost or you could build
 

5893
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,270
that defrays the cost or you could build
something or you could do podcasts and

5894
01:32:57,270 --> 01:32:57,280
something or you could do podcasts and
 

5895
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,350
something or you could do podcasts and
maybe you know fundraise on the podcast

5896
01:32:59,350 --> 01:32:59,360
maybe you know fundraise on the podcast
 

5897
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,430
maybe you know fundraise on the podcast
and so as long as you the reason the

5898
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:01,440
and so as long as you the reason the
 

5899
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,870
and so as long as you the reason the
cost is variable is because it depends

5900
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:02,880
cost is variable is because it depends
 

5901
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,709
cost is variable is because it depends
well do you have all the money and you

5902
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:04,719
well do you have all the money and you
 

5903
01:33:04,719 --> 01:33:06,149
well do you have all the money and you
say i want to go and just sit in space

5904
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:06,159
say i want to go and just sit in space
 

5905
01:33:06,159 --> 01:33:07,510
say i want to go and just sit in space
for two years and do nothing well then

5906
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,520
for two years and do nothing well then
 

5907
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,550
for two years and do nothing well then
you have to pay for all that time that

5908
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:08,560
you have to pay for all that time that
 

5909
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,750
you have to pay for all that time that
you're up there if you want to do things

5910
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:09,760
you're up there if you want to do things
 

5911
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,550
you're up there if you want to do things
and yeah i see the the official x1

5912
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:12,560
and yeah i see the the official x1
 

5913
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:16,149
and yeah i see the the official x1
mission was 55 million for a trip to the

5914
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:16,159
mission was 55 million for a trip to the
 

5915
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:19,510
mission was 55 million for a trip to the
iss

5916
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:19,520

 

5917
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:21,350

it could be worse

5918
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,360
it could be worse
 

5919
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,550
it could be worse
wait i uh sergey just posted a 35 000

5920
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,560
wait i uh sergey just posted a 35 000
 

5921
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,110
wait i uh sergey just posted a 35 000
price tag per night per person on the

5922
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:27,120
price tag per night per person on the
 

5923
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:28,790
price tag per night per person on the
iss is that real

5924
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
iss is that real
 

5925
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:29,990
iss is that real
i don't know that sounds about right

5926
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:30,000
i don't know that sounds about right
 

5927
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,310
i don't know that sounds about right
that's why that's like a real hotel so

5928
01:33:32,310 --> 01:33:32,320
that's why that's like a real hotel so
 

5929
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,590
that's why that's like a real hotel so
to stay

5930
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:33,600
to stay
 

5931
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,870
to stay
oh so interesting um and then i'm sure

5932
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:36,880
oh so interesting um and then i'm sure
 

5933
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:38,470
oh so interesting um and then i'm sure
there's costs with the docking and all

5934
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:38,480
there's costs with the docking and all
 

5935
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:39,990
there's costs with the docking and all
those kinds of things that's from the

5936
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:40,000
those kinds of things that's from the
 

5937
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,390
those kinds of things that's from the
perspective of axiom the private company

5938
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:42,400
perspective of axiom the private company
 

5939
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:45,110
perspective of axiom the private company
or spacex or whoever is

5940
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:45,120
or spacex or whoever is
 

5941
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,790
or spacex or whoever is
whoever is paying the cost and uh

5942
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:48,800
whoever is paying the cost and uh
 

5943
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,709
whoever is paying the cost and uh
in the short term in the in the long

5944
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:50,719
in the short term in the in the long
 

5945
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:51,990
in the short term in the in the long
term yeah

5946
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:52,000
term yeah
 

5947
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,350
term yeah
and then think about a lot of that cost

5948
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,360
and then think about a lot of that cost
 

5949
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,990
and then think about a lot of that cost
is rocket fuel a lot of it is the ride

5950
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
is rocket fuel a lot of it is the ride
 

5951
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,750
is rocket fuel a lot of it is the ride
so it's i've been on calls where axioms

5952
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:57,760
so it's i've been on calls where axioms
 

5953
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,750
so it's i've been on calls where axioms
like hey spacex give us make it a little

5954
01:33:59,750 --> 01:33:59,760
like hey spacex give us make it a little
 

5955
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,350
like hey spacex give us make it a little
cheaper we can make it cheaper and it

5956
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:01,360
cheaper we can make it cheaper and it
 

5957
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:03,110
cheaper we can make it cheaper and it
there's the cost that that is the rocket

5958
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:03,120
there's the cost that that is the rocket
 

5959
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,510
there's the cost that that is the rocket
as well so spacex is giving axiom a ride

5960
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:05,520
as well so spacex is giving axiom a ride
 

5961
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,830
as well so spacex is giving axiom a ride
right right in this case what is axiom

5962
01:34:07,830 --> 01:34:07,840
right right in this case what is axiom
 

5963
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:09,750
right right in this case what is axiom
space can you speak to this

5964
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:09,760
space can you speak to this
 

5965
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:11,270
space can you speak to this
this particular private company what's

5966
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
this particular private company what's
 

5967
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,030
this particular private company what's
their mission what's their goal and what

5968
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,040
their mission what's their goal and what
 

5969
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,550
their mission what's their goal and what
what is the axiom one mission that just

5970
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:14,560
what is the axiom one mission that just
 

5971
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:16,310
what is the axiom one mission that just
went up yeah it's uh

5972
01:34:16,310 --> 01:34:16,320
went up yeah it's uh
 

5973
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,430
went up yeah it's uh
so the axiom space is a private

5974
01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
so the axiom space is a private
 

5975
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:21,350
so the axiom space is a private
space flight company that's building the

5976
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:21,360
space flight company that's building the
 

5977
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,629
space flight company that's building the
the first

5978
01:34:22,629 --> 01:34:22,639
the first
 

5979
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:24,310
the first
private space station to actually i've

5980
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,320
private space station to actually i've
 

5981
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,310
private space station to actually i've
seen the videos and footage and hardware

5982
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,320
seen the videos and footage and hardware
 

5983
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,669
seen the videos and footage and hardware
being put together so they're in the

5984
01:34:27,669 --> 01:34:27,679
being put together so they're in the
 

5985
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:28,790
being put together so they're in the
process of

5986
01:34:28,790 --> 01:34:28,800
process of
 

5987
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,750
process of
constructing it the hope is that by 2024

5988
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:31,760
constructing it the hope is that by 2024
 

5989
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,990
constructing it the hope is that by 2024
one of the first modules will be up and

5990
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,000
one of the first modules will be up and
 

5991
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,229
one of the first modules will be up and
connected to the iss and eventually be

5992
01:34:36,229 --> 01:34:36,239
connected to the iss and eventually be
 

5993
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,470
connected to the iss and eventually be
expanded and then by 2028 the plan is

5994
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:38,480
expanded and then by 2028 the plan is
 

5995
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,030
expanded and then by 2028 the plan is
it'll be completely uh detached and free

5996
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:41,040
it'll be completely uh detached and free
 

5997
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,430
it'll be completely uh detached and free
floating and it will be maybe even a

5998
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:43,440
floating and it will be maybe even a
 

5999
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:44,629
floating and it will be maybe even a
little bit sooner depending on how fast

6000
01:34:44,629 --> 01:34:44,639
little bit sooner depending on how fast
 

6001
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:46,470
little bit sooner depending on how fast
it goes but they're building the world's

6002
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:46,480
it goes but they're building the world's
 

6003
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,310
it goes but they're building the world's
first private space station so if you

6004
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:48,320
first private space station so if you
 

6005
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,070
first private space station so if you
want to have a wedding up there

6006
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,080
want to have a wedding up there
 

6007
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,270
want to have a wedding up there
you just have to multiply the number of

6008
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:51,280
you just have to multiply the number of
 

6009
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:52,470
you just have to multiply the number of
guests times the number of nights and

6010
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:52,480
guests times the number of nights and
 

6011
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,510
guests times the number of nights and
you could have a wedding up there it'd

6012
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:53,520
you could have a wedding up there it'd
 

6013
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:54,870
you could have a wedding up there it'd
be very expensive but if you want to do

6014
01:34:54,870 --> 01:34:54,880
be very expensive but if you want to do
 

6015
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:56,709
be very expensive but if you want to do
it you can do it it's like it's it's you

6016
01:34:56,709 --> 01:34:56,719
it you can do it it's like it's it's you
 

6017
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:57,669
it you can do it it's like it's it's you
can have a lab up there if you want to

6018
01:34:57,669 --> 01:34:57,679
can have a lab up there if you want to
 

6019
01:34:57,679 --> 01:34:59,109
can have a lab up there if you want to
do experiments you can do experiments

6020
01:34:59,109 --> 01:34:59,119
do experiments you can do experiments
 

6021
01:34:59,119 --> 01:35:01,189
do experiments you can do experiments
you figure out the cost you want to have

6022
01:35:01,189 --> 01:35:01,199
you figure out the cost you want to have
 

6023
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:02,709
you figure out the cost you want to have
a beer up there you can make your own

6024
01:35:02,709 --> 01:35:02,719
a beer up there you can make your own
 

6025
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:03,910
a beer up there you can make your own
breeder and beer and so this is the

6026
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
breeder and beer and so this is the
 

6027
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,510
breeder and beer and so this is the
first beer made in space for some reason

6028
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:05,520
first beer made in space for some reason
 

6029
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,430
first beer made in space for some reason
you want to do it you can pay for it so

6030
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:07,440
you want to do it you can pay for it so
 

6031
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:09,830
you want to do it you can pay for it so
it's opened up this space where if you

6032
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:09,840
it's opened up this space where if you
 

6033
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,910
it's opened up this space where if you
can find the funds for it you propose it

6034
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:11,920
can find the funds for it you propose it
 

6035
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:15,430
can find the funds for it you propose it
you can probably just do it okay cool uh

6036
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,440
you can probably just do it okay cool uh
 

6037
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,750
you can probably just do it okay cool uh
so what is the axiom one mission that

6038
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
so what is the axiom one mission that
 

6039
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,270
so what is the axiom one mission that
just went up can you tell me what

6040
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:19,280
just went up can you tell me what
 

6041
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,470
just went up can you tell me what
happened axiom one is the first private

6042
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:22,480
happened axiom one is the first private
 

6043
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:23,189
happened axiom one is the first private
uh

6044
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:23,199
uh
 

6045
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:24,629
uh
the first commercial crew to go to the

6046
01:35:24,629 --> 01:35:24,639
the first commercial crew to go to the
 

6047
01:35:24,639 --> 01:35:26,550
the first commercial crew to go to the
space station so inspiration four was

6048
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:26,560
space station so inspiration four was
 

6049
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:27,510
space station so inspiration four was
the first

6050
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:27,520
the first
 

6051
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,950
the first
commercial private crew to just go into

6052
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:28,960
commercial private crew to just go into
 

6053
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,790
commercial private crew to just go into
space they went in space and actually an

6054
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:30,800
space they went in space and actually an
 

6055
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,550
space they went in space and actually an
orbital mission for just about three

6056
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:32,560
orbital mission for just about three
 

6057
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,350
orbital mission for just about three
days

6058
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:33,360
days
 

6059
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,510
days
but axiom 1 is the first you know again

6060
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:35,520
but axiom 1 is the first you know again
 

6061
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:37,109
but axiom 1 is the first you know again
on the spacex rockets but launched up

6062
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:37,119
on the spacex rockets but launched up
 

6063
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,950
on the spacex rockets but launched up
docked to the space station and they're

6064
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:38,960
docked to the space station and they're
 

6065
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,790
docked to the space station and they're
up there for about 10 days to do

6066
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:40,800
up there for about 10 days to do
 

6067
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,950
up there for about 10 days to do
experiments to work with staff actually

6068
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:42,960
experiments to work with staff actually
 

6069
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,470
experiments to work with staff actually
just take some pictures

6070
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:44,480
just take some pictures
 

6071
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:46,070
just take some pictures
but it's a mission

6072
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:46,080
but it's a mission
 

6073
01:35:46,080 --> 01:35:47,189
but it's a mission
actually doing a lot of experiments

6074
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:47,199
actually doing a lot of experiments
 

6075
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,790
actually doing a lot of experiments
doing almost 80 different experiments so

6076
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:48,800
doing almost 80 different experiments so
 

6077
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,149
doing almost 80 different experiments so
it's live it's very science-heavy which

6078
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:50,159
it's live it's very science-heavy which
 

6079
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,750
it's live it's very science-heavy which
i love as a scientist

6080
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:51,760
i love as a scientist
 

6081
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,430
i love as a scientist
but it's the ability to show that you

6082
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:53,440
but it's the ability to show that you
 

6083
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,990
but it's the ability to show that you
can fundraise and launch up a crew

6084
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:56,000
can fundraise and launch up a crew
 

6085
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,350
can fundraise and launch up a crew
that's all privately funded and then go

6086
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:57,360
that's all privately funded and then go
 

6087
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,030
that's all privately funded and then go
to the space station it's four people

6088
01:35:59,030 --> 01:35:59,040
to the space station it's four people
 

6089
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,870
to the space station it's four people
and four people and the axiom two will

6090
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:00,880
and four people and the axiom two will
 

6091
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,709
and four people and the axiom two will
also likely be four people the two that

6092
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:02,719
also likely be four people the two that
 

6093
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:04,470
also likely be four people the two that
have been announced are john schaffner

01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:04,480
have been announced are john schaffner
 

6095
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,229
have been announced are john schaffner
and peggy whitson peggy woodson's uh

6096
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:06,239
and peggy whitson peggy woodson's uh
 

6097
01:36:06,239 --> 01:36:07,910

01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:07,920
already prior nasa astronaut has been at
 

6099
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:09,830
already prior nasa astronaut has been at
many times the many experiments she

6100
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:09,840
many times the many experiments she
 

6101
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:11,669
many times the many experiments she
knows the space station like our own

6102
01:36:11,669 --> 01:36:11,679
knows the space station like our own
 

6103
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:12,550
knows the space station like our own
house

6104
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:12,560
house
 

6105
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,229
house
and uh we recently did a training with

6106
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:14,239
and uh we recently did a training with
 

6107
01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,550
and uh we recently did a training with
peggy and john in my lab at cornell to

6108
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:16,560
peggy and john in my lab at cornell to
 

6109
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,310
peggy and john in my lab at cornell to
get ready for some other genomics

6110
01:36:18,310 --> 01:36:18,320
get ready for some other genomics
 

6111
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,510
get ready for some other genomics
experiments that we'll do on that

6112
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:19,520
experiments that we'll do on that
 

6113
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,189
experiments that we'll do on that
mission so they're doing the experiments

6114
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:21,199
mission so they're doing the experiments
 

6115
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:22,550
mission so they're doing the experiments
too

6116
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:22,560
too
 

6117
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:24,310
too
what does it take to design an

6118
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:24,320
what does it take to design an
 

6119
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,109
what does it take to design an
experiment and to run a design

6120
01:36:27,109 --> 01:36:27,119
experiment and to run a design
 

6121
01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:28,790
experiment and to run a design
experiment here on earth that runs up

6122
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
experiment here on earth that runs up
 

6123
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,109
experiment here on earth that runs up
there and then also to actually do the

6124
01:36:31,109 --> 01:36:31,119
there and then also to actually do the
 

6125
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:32,470
there and then also to actually do the
the running of the experiment what are

6126
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:32,480
the running of the experiment what are
 

6127
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,830
the running of the experiment what are
the constraints what are the

6128
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:33,840
the constraints what are the
 

6129
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,910
the constraints what are the
opportunities all that kind of stuff

6130
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:35,920
opportunities all that kind of stuff
 

6131
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:38,390
opportunities all that kind of stuff
there are the biggest is is what is it

6132
01:36:38,390 --> 01:36:38,400
there are the biggest is is what is it
 

6133
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,669
there are the biggest is is what is it
what do you need for reagents or

6134
01:36:39,669 --> 01:36:39,679
what do you need for reagents or
 

6135
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:41,189
what do you need for reagents or
materials the liquids that you might use

6136
01:36:41,189 --> 01:36:41,199
materials the liquids that you might use
 

6137
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,950
materials the liquids that you might use
for any experiment what if it floats

6138
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:42,960
for any experiment what if it floats
 

6139
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,550
for any experiment what if it floats
away what if it gets in someone's eye

6140
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:44,560
away what if it gets in someone's eye
 

6141
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,070
away what if it gets in someone's eye
because things always float away in

6142
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:46,080
because things always float away in
 

6143
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,149
because things always float away in
space there's notoriously panels in the

6144
01:36:48,149 --> 01:36:48,159
space there's notoriously panels in the
 

6145
01:36:48,159 --> 01:36:49,109
space there's notoriously panels in the
space station where you don't want to

6146
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:49,119
space station where you don't want to
 

6147
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:50,149
space station where you don't want to
look behind because it's got a little

6148
01:36:50,149 --> 01:36:50,159
look behind because it's got a little
 

6149
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:52,390
look behind because it's got a little
fungus or food has gotten stuck there

6150
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:52,400
fungus or food has gotten stuck there
 

6151
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,229
fungus or food has gotten stuck there
and sometimes found months and months or

6152
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:54,239
and sometimes found months and months or
 

6153
01:36:54,239 --> 01:36:56,550
and sometimes found months and months or
years later so things things float

6154
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:56,560
years later so things things float
 

6155
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:58,229
years later so things things float
around so the little things

6156
01:36:58,229 --> 01:36:58,239
around so the little things
 

6157
01:36:58,239 --> 01:37:00,229
around so the little things
just and and so if you have anything you

6158
01:37:00,229 --> 01:37:00,239
just and and so if you have anything you
 

6159
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:01,350
just and and so if you have anything you
need to do your experiment that's a

6160
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,360
need to do your experiment that's a
 

6161
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,550
need to do your experiment that's a
liquid or a solid whatever that is it

6162
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:02,560
liquid or a solid whatever that is it
 

6163
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:04,709
liquid or a solid whatever that is it
has to go through toxicity testing

6164
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:04,719
has to go through toxicity testing
 

6165
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:06,390
has to go through toxicity testing
and the big question is if this thing

6166
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:06,400
and the big question is if this thing
 

6167
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:07,669
and the big question is if this thing
whatever you want to use gets in

6168
01:37:07,669 --> 01:37:07,679
whatever you want to use gets in
 

6169
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:09,669
whatever you want to use gets in
someone's eye will they lose their

6170
01:37:09,669 --> 01:37:09,679
someone's eye will they lose their
 

6171
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:11,669
someone's eye will they lose their
vision or be really injured and if the

6172
01:37:11,669 --> 01:37:11,679
vision or be really injured and if the
 

6173
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:13,430
vision or be really injured and if the
answer is yes it doesn't mean the answer

6174
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:13,440
answer is yes it doesn't mean the answer
 

6175
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:14,390
answer is yes it doesn't mean the answer
you can't use it just means if the

6176
01:37:14,390 --> 01:37:14,400
you can't use it just means if the
 

6177
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:15,669
you can't use it just means if the
answers yes you have to then go through

6178
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:15,679
answers yes you have to then go through
 

6179
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,109
answers yes you have to then go through
multiple levels of containment there's a

6180
01:37:17,109 --> 01:37:17,119
multiple levels of containment there's a
 

6181
01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,350
multiple levels of containment there's a
glove box on the space station where you

6182
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
glove box on the space station where you
 

6183
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,870
glove box on the space station where you
can actually do experiments that have

6184
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
can actually do experiments that have
 

6185
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,790
can actually do experiments that have
triple layers of containment so you can

6186
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:22,800
triple layers of containment so you can
 

6187
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:24,629
triple layers of containment so you can
still use some harsh reagents but you

6188
01:37:24,629 --> 01:37:24,639
still use some harsh reagents but you
 

6189
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,790
still use some harsh reagents but you
have to do them in the glove box

6190
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:26,800
have to do them in the glove box
 

6191
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:28,310
have to do them in the glove box
and so but you can propose almost

6192
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:28,320
and so but you can propose almost
 

6193
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,750
and so but you can propose almost
anything the biggest challenge is the

6194
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:29,760
anything the biggest challenge is the
 

6195
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:31,669
anything the biggest challenge is the
weight if it's a heavy it's ten thousand

6196
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
weight if it's a heavy it's ten thousand
 

6197
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,430
weight if it's a heavy it's ten thousand
dollars per kilogram to get something up

6198
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:33,440
dollars per kilogram to get something up
 

6199
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,390
dollars per kilogram to get something up
into space

6200
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:34,400
into space
 

6201
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,629
into space
so if you have a big heavy object that

6202
01:37:36,629 --> 01:37:36,639
so if you have a big heavy object that
 

6203
01:37:36,639 --> 01:37:37,910
so if you have a big heavy object that
there's some costs you have to consider

6204
01:37:37,910 --> 01:37:37,920
there's some costs you have to consider
 

6205
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:39,510
there's some costs you have to consider
and that includes the not just the

6206
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:39,520
and that includes the not just the
 

6207
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,590
and that includes the not just the
materials but the the equipment used to

6208
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:41,600
materials but the the equipment used to
 

6209
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:43,109
materials but the the equipment used to
analyze the materials

6210
01:37:43,109 --> 01:37:43,119
analyze the materials
 

6211
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:44,629
analyze the materials
one of the ones we worked on actually

6212
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
one of the ones we worked on actually
 

6213
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:45,990
one of the ones we worked on actually
with kate rubins was putting the first

6214
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:46,000
with kate rubins was putting the first
 

6215
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,830
with kate rubins was putting the first
dna sequencer in space called the

6216
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:47,840
dna sequencer in space called the
 

6217
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,310
dna sequencer in space called the
biomolecular sequencer mission also with

6218
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:50,320
biomolecular sequencer mission also with
 

6219
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,470
biomolecular sequencer mission also with
aaron burton and sarah castro wallace

6220
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:52,480
aaron burton and sarah castro wallace
 

6221
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,870
aaron burton and sarah castro wallace
but there the interesting thing is we

6222
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
but there the interesting thing is we
 

6223
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:56,390
but there the interesting thing is we
had to prepare this tiny little

6224
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,400
had to prepare this tiny little
 

6225
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,070
had to prepare this tiny little
sequencer it sequences dna you can do it

6226
01:37:58,070 --> 01:37:58,080
sequencer it sequences dna you can do it
 

6227
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,310
sequencer it sequences dna you can do it
really quickly within really minutes

6228
01:38:00,310 --> 01:38:00,320
really quickly within really minutes
 

6229
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,189
really quickly within really minutes
and

6230
01:38:01,189 --> 01:38:01,199
and
 

6231
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:02,709
and
what's extraordinary is what you have to

6232
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:02,719
what's extraordinary is what you have to
 

6233
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:03,830
what's extraordinary is what you have to
do if you want to get a piece of

6234
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
do if you want to get a piece of
 

6235
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:05,189
do if you want to get a piece of
machinery up there you have to do

6236
01:38:05,189 --> 01:38:05,199
machinery up there you have to do
 

6237
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:06,470
machinery up there you have to do
destructive testing so you have to

6238
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:06,480
destructive testing so you have to
 

6239
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,830
destructive testing so you have to
destroy it and see what happens how does

6240
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:07,840
destroy it and see what happens how does
 

6241
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,590
destroy it and see what happens how does
it destroy do pieces little pieces of

6242
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:09,600
it destroy do pieces little pieces of
 

6243
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,950
it destroy do pieces little pieces of
glass break everywhere if so that's a

6244
01:38:10,950 --> 01:38:10,960
glass break everywhere if so that's a
 

6245
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,950
glass break everywhere if so that's a
problem so you have to redesign it and

6246
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:12,960
problem so you have to redesign it and
 

6247
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,790
problem so you have to redesign it and
do fire testing how does it burn how

6248
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:14,800
do fire testing how does it burn how
 

6249
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:16,149
do fire testing how does it burn how
does your device

6250
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:16,159
does your device
 

6251
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,070
does your device
explode in a fire or doesn't it you have

6252
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:18,080
explode in a fire or doesn't it you have
 

6253
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:19,350
explode in a fire or doesn't it you have
to test that and then you do vibration

6254
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:19,360
to test that and then you do vibration
 

6255
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:20,550
to test that and then you do vibration
testing so you have to basically if you

6256
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:20,560
testing so you have to basically if you
 

6257
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,149
testing so you have to basically if you
want to fly one thing into space you

6258
01:38:22,149 --> 01:38:22,159
want to fly one thing into space you
 

6259
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:23,910
want to fly one thing into space you
need to make four of them and destroy at

6260
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:23,920
need to make four of them and destroy at
 

6261
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,350
need to make four of them and destroy at
least three of them to know how they do

6262
01:38:25,350 --> 01:38:25,360
least three of them to know how they do
 

6263
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,830
least three of them to know how they do
how they destroy destructive destructive

6264
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:27,840
how they destroy destructive destructive
 

6265
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:30,629
how they destroy destructive destructive
fire fire and then vibration testing um

6266
01:38:30,629 --> 01:38:30,639
fire fire and then vibration testing um
 

6267
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,390
fire fire and then vibration testing um
it's kind of like asking for a friend

6268
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,400
it's kind of like asking for a friend
 

6269
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,149
it's kind of like asking for a friend
how how do you from a scientific

6270
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:34,159
how how do you from a scientific
 

6271
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,790
how how do you from a scientific
perspective do destructive testing

6272
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:36,800
perspective do destructive testing
 

6273
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:38,950
perspective do destructive testing
and how do you do fire testing and how

6274
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:38,960
and how do you do fire testing and how
 

6275
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,709
and how do you do fire testing and how
do you do vibration testing vibrations

6276
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:40,719
do you do vibration testing vibrations
 

6277
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,470
do you do vibration testing vibrations
like well just large shakers so that's

6278
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:42,480
like well just large shakers so that's
 

6279
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:44,550
like well just large shakers so that's
uh this is mostly to simulate launch

6280
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:44,560
uh this is mostly to simulate launch
 

6281
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,310
uh this is mostly to simulate launch
they have a lot of machinery at nasa and

6282
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
they have a lot of machinery at nasa and
 

6283
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,629
they have a lot of machinery at nasa and
it's spacex to do just to make sure what

6284
01:38:48,629 --> 01:38:48,639
it's spacex to do just to make sure what
 

6285
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,229
it's spacex to do just to make sure what
does this completely fall apart if it

6286
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:50,239
does this completely fall apart if it
 

6287
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:51,830
does this completely fall apart if it
has a high vibrational

6288
01:38:51,830 --> 01:38:51,840
has a high vibrational
 

6289
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,430
has a high vibrational
essentially force attached to it so it's

6290
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:53,440
essentially force attached to it so it's
 

6291
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:56,470
essentially force attached to it so it's
just looking like a big shaker

6292
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:56,480
just looking like a big shaker
 

6293
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,629
just looking like a big shaker
fire testing is just to simulate what

6294
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:58,639
fire testing is just to simulate what
 

6295
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,229
fire testing is just to simulate what
would happen if there was a normal fire

6296
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
would happen if there was a normal fire
 

6297
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,750
would happen if there was a normal fire
that something that gets up to you know

6298
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:01,760
that something that gets up to you know
 

6299
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,270
that something that gets up to you know
the fire temperatures several hundred

6300
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,280
the fire temperatures several hundred
 

6301
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,550
the fire temperatures several hundred
degrees celsius

6302
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:04,560
degrees celsius
 

6303
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,550
degrees celsius
and does spin fire or are we talking

6304
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:06,560
and does spin fire or are we talking
 

6305
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,310
and does spin fire or are we talking
like you put in a toaster no it's more

6306
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:08,320
like you put in a toaster no it's more
 

6307
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,149
like you put in a toaster no it's more
like heat or is it over flames it's

6308
01:39:10,149 --> 01:39:10,159
like heat or is it over flames it's
 

6309
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:11,750
like heat or is it over flames it's
flames then heat but it's it's not like

6310
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:11,760
flames then heat but it's it's not like
 

6311
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:12,950
flames then heat but it's it's not like
a kiln or anything like that it's not

6312
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:12,960
a kiln or anything like that it's not
 

6313
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,229
a kiln or anything like that it's not
you don't want to know how does it burn

6314
01:39:14,229 --> 01:39:14,239
you don't want to know how does it burn
 

6315
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:16,229
you don't want to know how does it burn
in the kiln it's more is it flammable

6316
01:39:16,229 --> 01:39:16,239
in the kiln it's more is it flammable
 

6317
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:17,270
in the kiln it's more is it flammable
it's the first big question like does it

6318
01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:17,280
it's the first big question like does it
 

6319
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:18,470
it's the first big question like does it
just start on fire if it gets a little

6320
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
just start on fire if it gets a little
 

6321
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,830
just start on fire if it gets a little
bit of flame on it does it just light up

6322
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:19,840
bit of flame on it does it just light up
 

6323
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,430
bit of flame on it does it just light up
like a christmas there's a youtube video

6324
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:21,440
like a christmas there's a youtube video
 

6325
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,350
like a christmas there's a youtube video
of this oh you know what you guys did

6326
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:23,360
of this oh you know what you guys did
 

6327
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,550
of this oh you know what you guys did
you film any of this not um aaron burton

6328
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:26,560
you film any of this not um aaron burton
 

6329
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:28,790
you film any of this not um aaron burton
might still have some of the videos uh

6330
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:28,800
might still have some of the videos uh
 

6331
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,830
might still have some of the videos uh
we're in the middle of doing some

6332
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:29,840
we're in the middle of doing some
 

6333
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:31,669
we're in the middle of doing some
testing for the new sequencer called the

6334
01:39:31,669 --> 01:39:31,679
testing for the new sequencer called the
 

6335
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:34,470
testing for the new sequencer called the
mark 1c so i will make videos of that i

6336
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:34,480
mark 1c so i will make videos of that i
 

6337
01:39:34,480 --> 01:39:37,270
mark 1c so i will make videos of that i
would i would love to uh see that for if

6338
01:39:37,270 --> 01:39:37,280
would i would love to uh see that for if
 

6339
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:39,030
would i would love to uh see that for if
anything for my private collection and

6340
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:39,040
anything for my private collection and
 

6341
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,310
anything for my private collection and
this is very exciting and the

6342
01:39:40,310 --> 01:39:40,320
this is very exciting and the
 

6343
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,070
this is very exciting and the
destructive testing is just often it can

6344
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:42,080
destructive testing is just often it can
 

6345
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:43,510
destructive testing is just often it can
be something as simple as as a hammer

6346
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:43,520
be something as simple as as a hammer
 

6347
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:44,629
be something as simple as as a hammer
it's really how does it chatter you want

6348
01:39:44,629 --> 01:39:44,639
it's really how does it chatter you want
 

6349
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:45,990
it's really how does it chatter you want
to question his other glass components

6350
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:46,000
to question his other glass components
 

6351
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,990
to question his other glass components
and stuff so it's like office space it

6352
01:39:47,990 --> 01:39:48,000
and stuff so it's like office space it
 

6353
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,910
and stuff so it's like office space it
looks like that scene

6354
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:49,920
looks like that scene
 

6355
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,950
looks like that scene
with the facts

6356
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:52,960

 

6357
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,310

damn it feels good to be a gangster

6358
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:54,320
damn it feels good to be a gangster
 

6359
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,510
damn it feels good to be a gangster
soundtrack yeah that's a great scene

6360
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:57,520
soundtrack yeah that's a great scene
 

6361
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,030
soundtrack yeah that's a great scene
that's so that's so exciting that kind

6362
01:39:59,030 --> 01:39:59,040
that's so that's so exciting that kind
 

6363
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,390
that's so that's so exciting that kind
of that's the best of engineering is

6364
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:00,400
of that's the best of engineering is
 

6365
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,229
of that's the best of engineering is
like that kind of testing

6366
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:02,239
like that kind of testing
 

6367
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:03,189
like that kind of testing
what else

6368
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:03,199
what else
 

6369
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,030
what else
about designing experiments like what

6370
01:40:05,030 --> 01:40:05,040
about designing experiments like what
 

6371
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:06,709
about designing experiments like what
kind of stuff do you want to get in

6372
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:06,719
kind of stuff do you want to get in
 

6373
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,870
kind of stuff do you want to get in
there you said 80 different experiments

6374
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:08,880
there you said 80 different experiments
 

6375
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,350
there you said 80 different experiments
so we're staying in the realm of biology

6376
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:11,360
so we're staying in the realm of biology
 

6377
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:12,229
so we're staying in the realm of biology
and

6378
01:40:12,229 --> 01:40:12,239
and
 

6379
01:40:12,239 --> 01:40:14,550
and
genetics yeah for now but we but we also

6380
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:14,560
genetics yeah for now but we but we also
 

6381
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,510
genetics yeah for now but we but we also
want to do you know some of the

6382
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:15,520
want to do you know some of the
 

6383
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,030
want to do you know some of the
experiments have been discussed in the

6384
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,040
experiments have been discussed in the
 

6385
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:19,270
experiments have been discussed in the
lab have been and some are being planned

6386
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:19,280
lab have been and some are being planned
 

6387
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:19,990
lab have been and some are being planned
as well but i think the most

6388
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:20,000
as well but i think the most
 

6389
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,510
as well but i think the most
controversial one that's come up in our

6390
01:40:21,510 --> 01:40:21,520
controversial one that's come up in our
 

6391
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:22,709
controversial one that's come up in our
in our planning

6392
01:40:22,709 --> 01:40:22,719
in our planning
 

6393
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:24,709
in our planning
it gets back to sex in space is you know

6394
01:40:24,709 --> 01:40:24,719
it gets back to sex in space is you know
 

6395
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:26,550
it gets back to sex in space is you know
can human embryos

6396
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:26,560
can human embryos
 

6397
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,390
can human embryos
divide and actually begin to develop in

6398
01:40:28,390 --> 01:40:28,400
divide and actually begin to develop in
 

6399
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,310
divide and actually begin to develop in
space but then if we do that experiment

6400
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:30,320
space but then if we do that experiment
 

6401
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,149
space but then if we do that experiment
that means you're taking viable human

6402
01:40:32,149 --> 01:40:32,159
that means you're taking viable human
 

6403
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:33,270
that means you're taking viable human
embryos

6404
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:33,280
embryos
 

6405
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,709
embryos
watching them develop in space then you

6406
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:34,719
watching them develop in space then you
 

6407
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:35,910
watching them develop in space then you
can freeze them and bring them down and

6408
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:35,920
can freeze them and bring them down and
 

6409
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,430
can freeze them and bring them down and
characterize them to see

6410
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:37,440
characterize them to see
 

6411
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:38,790
characterize them to see
but to answer that question because we

6412
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:38,800
but to answer that question because we
 

6413
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,030
but to answer that question because we
actually don't know can a human embryo

6414
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:41,040
actually don't know can a human embryo
 

6415
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:43,189
actually don't know can a human embryo
actually develop well in zero gravity we

6416
01:40:43,189 --> 01:40:43,199
actually develop well in zero gravity we
 

6417
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:44,709
actually develop well in zero gravity we
just don't know

6418
01:40:44,709 --> 01:40:44,719
just don't know
 

6419
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,310
just don't know
but to find that out that means we have

6420
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:46,320
but to find that out that means we have
 

6421
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,470
but to find that out that means we have
to literally sacrifice embryos probably

6422
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:48,480
to literally sacrifice embryos probably
 

6423
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,390
to literally sacrifice embryos probably
so and which itself has of course

6424
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:50,400
so and which itself has of course
 

6425
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,390
so and which itself has of course
uh you know a lot of complications

6426
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:52,400
uh you know a lot of complications
 

6427
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,070
uh you know a lot of complications
ethical considerations some people just

6428
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:54,080
ethical considerations some people just
 

6429
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,910
ethical considerations some people just
wouldn't it's a non-starter for lots of

6430
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:55,920
wouldn't it's a non-starter for lots of
 

6431
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:56,790
wouldn't it's a non-starter for lots of
people

6432
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:56,800
people
 

6433
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,109
people
so but we do know that this sperm

6434
01:40:59,109 --> 01:40:59,119
so but we do know that this sperm
 

6435
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:00,229
so but we do know that this sperm
survives

6436
01:41:00,229 --> 01:41:00,239
survives
 

6437
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:02,149
survives
as earlier said yes and nobody cares

6438
01:41:02,149 --> 01:41:02,159
as earlier said yes and nobody cares
 

6439
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,229
as earlier said yes and nobody cares
about sperm

6440
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:04,239
about sperm
 

6441
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,310
about sperm
we're doing several studies on uh autism

6442
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:06,320
we're doing several studies on uh autism

risk for fathers and sperm and you know

6444
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:08,560
risk for fathers and sperm and you know
 

6445
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,830
risk for fathers and sperm and you know
it's really easy to get sperm i'll just

6446
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:09,840
it's really easy to get sperm i'll just
 

6447
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:11,270
it's really easy to get sperm i'll just
tell you it's uh people say you're

6448
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:11,280
tell you it's uh people say you're
 

6449
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,270
tell you it's uh people say you're
helping us what i hear that's right so i

of sharing of samples and data for all
 

6489
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,470
of sharing of samples and data for all
these missions for basically for all the

these missions for basically for all the
 

6491
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:52,310
these missions for basically for all the
commercial spaceflight missions there'll

6492
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:52,320
commercial spaceflight missions there'll
 

6493
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,590
commercial spaceflight missions there'll
be a repository where you can look at

6494
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:53,600
be a repository where you can look at
 

6495
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,870
be a repository where you can look at
the data from the astronauts so you can

6496
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:54,880
the data from the astronauts so you can
 

6497
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,149
the data from the astronauts so you can
look at some of the genetic information

6498
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
look at some of the genetic information
 

6499
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:58,470
look at some of the genetic information
some of the molecular changes so that's

6500
01:41:58,470 --> 01:41:58,480
some of the molecular changes so that's
 

6501
01:41:58,480 --> 01:41:59,830
some of the molecular changes so that's
being built up with trish which has been

6502
01:41:59,830 --> 01:41:59,840
being built up with trish which has been
 

6503
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:01,430
being built up with trish which has been
fabulous collaboration between cornell

6504
01:42:01,430 --> 01:42:01,440
fabulous collaboration between cornell
 

6505
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:02,790
fabulous collaboration between cornell
and trish but the other thing we're

6506
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:02,800
and trish but the other thing we're
 

6507
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,629
and trish but the other thing we're
doing is for axiom two is training them

6508
01:42:04,629 --> 01:42:04,639
doing is for axiom two is training them
 

6509
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,550
doing is for axiom two is training them
how do you for example if you want to

6510
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:06,560
how do you for example if you want to
 

6511
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,229
how do you for example if you want to
look at a virus you can take a swab of

6512
01:42:08,229 --> 01:42:08,239
look at a virus you can take a swab of
 

6513
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:10,790
look at a virus you can take a swab of
something extract it sequence it and say

6514
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:10,800
something extract it sequence it and say
 

6515
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,070
something extract it sequence it and say
do i have omicron or do i have a

6516
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:12,080
do i have omicron or do i have a
 

6517
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,510
do i have omicron or do i have a
different virus and we're using the

6518
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:13,520
different virus and we're using the
 

6519
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,510
different virus and we're using the
exact same work in flight but we're

6520
01:42:15,510 --> 01:42:15,520
exact same work in flight but we're
 

6521
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:17,270
exact same work in flight but we're
having the astronauts do

6522
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
having the astronauts do
 

6523
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,790
having the astronauts do
the extraction the sequencing and the

6524
01:42:18,790 --> 01:42:18,800
the extraction the sequencing and the
 

6525
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:21,830
the extraction the sequencing and the
analysis of all the molecules and so one

6526
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:21,840
analysis of all the molecules and so one
 

6527
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,510
analysis of all the molecules and so one
of the common occurrences herpes is

6528
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:23,520
of the common occurrences herpes is
 

6529
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,669
of the common occurrences herpes is
reactivated often in spaceflight oral

6530
01:42:25,669 --> 01:42:25,679
reactivated often in spaceflight oral
 

6531
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:27,910
reactivated often in spaceflight oral
herpes so you can see that viral

6532
01:42:27,910 --> 01:42:27,920
herpes so you can see that viral
 

6533
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:29,350
herpes so you can see that viral
reactivation is one of the biggest kind

6534
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:29,360
reactivation is one of the biggest kind
 

6535
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:31,430
reactivation is one of the biggest kind
of mysteries in space flight where the

6536
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:31,440
of mysteries in space flight where the
 

6537
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,109
of mysteries in space flight where the
immune system seems to be responding a

6538
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:33,119
immune system seems to be responding a
 

6539
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:34,950
immune system seems to be responding a
lot it's active the body's really

6540
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
lot it's active the body's really
 

6541
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,109
lot it's active the body's really
perturbed but viruses start shedding

6542
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:37,119
perturbed but viruses start shedding
 

6543
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:39,270
perturbed but viruses start shedding
again and it's really this happens

6544
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:39,280
again and it's really this happens
 

6545
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,629
again and it's really this happens
clinically again we see this for like

6546
01:42:40,629 --> 01:42:40,639
clinically again we see this for like
 

6547
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:42,950
clinically again we see this for like
for example hepatitis c or hepatitis b

6548
01:42:42,950 --> 01:42:42,960
for example hepatitis c or hepatitis b
 

6549
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:44,149
for example hepatitis c or hepatitis b
you can get infected with it and it can

6550
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:44,159
you can get infected with it and it can
 

6551
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,310
you can get infected with it and it can
stain your body for decades and still

6552
01:42:46,310 --> 01:42:46,320
stain your body for decades and still
 

6553
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:47,590
stain your body for decades and still
kind of be hiding in the body and in

6554
01:42:47,590 --> 01:42:47,600
kind of be hiding in the body and in
 

6555
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,189
kind of be hiding in the body and in
this case we see it in space flight

6556
01:42:49,189 --> 01:42:49,199
this case we see it in space flight
 

6557
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:50,870
this case we see it in space flight
herpes comes back so we want to figure

6558
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:50,880
herpes comes back so we want to figure
 

6559
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,550
herpes comes back so we want to figure
out is it there first of all and then

6560
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:52,560
out is it there first of all and then
 

6561
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,709
out is it there first of all and then
when is it happening and characterize it

6562
01:42:54,709 --> 01:42:54,719
when is it happening and characterize it
 

6563
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,070
when is it happening and characterize it
better but have the astronauts do it

6564
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:56,080
better but have the astronauts do it
 

6565
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,510
better but have the astronauts do it
themselves rather than collecting it and

6566
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:57,520
themselves rather than collecting it and
 

6567
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:58,709
themselves rather than collecting it and
bringing it back to earth and figuring

6568
01:42:58,709 --> 01:42:58,719
bringing it back to earth and figuring
 

6569
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:00,550
bringing it back to earth and figuring
out later we could see in real time how

6570
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:00,560
out later we could see in real time how
 

6571
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:01,990
out later we could see in real time how
it's happening and then also look at

6572
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,000
it's happening and then also look at
 

6573
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,270
it's happening and then also look at
their blood we'll see what what is

6574
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:03,280
their blood we'll see what what is
 

6575
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,109
their blood we'll see what what is
changing in their blood in real time

6576
01:43:05,109 --> 01:43:05,119
changing in their blood in real time
 

6577
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:06,470
changing in their blood in real time
with these these new sequencers so i'm

6578
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:06,480
with these these new sequencers so i'm
 

6579
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,470
with these these new sequencers so i'm
excited about the genomics in space if

6580
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:08,480
excited about the genomics in space if
 

6581
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:10,870
excited about the genomics in space if
you will so clearly somebody who loves

6582
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:10,880
you will so clearly somebody who loves
 

6583
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,189
you will so clearly somebody who loves
robots um how many robots are up there

6584
01:43:13,189 --> 01:43:13,199
robots um how many robots are up there
 

6585
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:15,030
robots um how many robots are up there
in space that help with the experiments

6586
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:15,040
in space that help with the experiments
 

6587
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:18,629
in space that help with the experiments
like what how much technology is there

6588
01:43:18,629 --> 01:43:18,639
like what how much technology is there
 

6589
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:21,510
like what how much technology is there
would you say is it is it really a

6590
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:21,520
would you say is it is it really a
 

6591
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:23,109
would you say is it is it really a
manual

6592
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:23,119
manual
 

6593
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:24,950
manual
activity or is there a lot of robots

6594
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:24,960
activity or is there a lot of robots
 

6595
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:26,950
activity or is there a lot of robots
helping out good questions so far it's

6596
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:26,960
helping out good questions so far it's
 

6597
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,790
helping out good questions so far it's
almost all manual because the robots

6598
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:28,800
almost all manual because the robots
 

6599
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:30,709
almost all manual because the robots
have to all undergo the destructive fire

6600
01:43:30,709 --> 01:43:30,719
have to all undergo the destructive fire
 

6601
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:32,870
have to all undergo the destructive fire
and vibrational testing how so if you

6602
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:32,880
and vibrational testing how so if you
 

6603
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,470
and vibrational testing how so if you
have a million dollars so exciting yeah

6604
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:34,480
have a million dollars so exciting yeah
 

6605
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:36,790
have a million dollars so exciting yeah
so if you can get that thing is a lot

6606
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:36,800
so if you can get that thing is a lot
 

6607
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,550
so if you can get that thing is a lot
less than a million so we can definitely

6608
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:40,560
less than a million so we can definitely
 

6609
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,350
less than a million so we can definitely
test it out for the uh in i guess in

6610
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:43,360
test it out for the uh in i guess in
 

6611
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,030
test it out for the uh in i guess in
which order no you have to do separate

6612
01:43:45,030 --> 01:43:45,040
which order no you have to do separate
 

6613
01:43:45,040 --> 01:43:46,629
which order no you have to do separate
for each one yeah

6614
01:43:46,629 --> 01:43:46,639
for each one yeah
 

6615
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:49,030
for each one yeah
vibration fire

6616
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:49,040
vibration fire
 

6617
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:50,229
vibration fire
uh no

6618
01:43:50,229 --> 01:43:50,239
uh no
 

6619
01:43:50,239 --> 01:43:53,669
uh no
note to self do fire testing for the

6620
01:43:53,669 --> 01:43:53,679
note to self do fire testing for the
 

6621
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:55,990
note to self do fire testing for the
legged robots and the destructive

6622
01:43:55,990 --> 01:43:56,000
legged robots and the destructive
 

6623
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,470
legged robots and the destructive
testing that would be fascinating i

6624
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:58,480
testing that would be fascinating i
 

6625
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,390
testing that would be fascinating i
wonder if uh

6626
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,400
wonder if uh
 

6627
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:01,910
wonder if uh
any of the folks i'm working with did

6628
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:01,920
any of the folks i'm working with did
 

6629
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,510
any of the folks i'm working with did
that kind of testing on the materials

6630
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:03,520
that kind of testing on the materials
 

6631
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,189
that kind of testing on the materials
like what breaks first

6632
01:44:05,189 --> 01:44:05,199
like what breaks first
 

6633
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:07,109
like what breaks first
with the robots that's the question and

6634
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:07,119
with the robots that's the question and
 

6635
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:08,870
with the robots that's the question and
also the big question so what's

6636
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:08,880
also the big question so what's
 

6637
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,149
also the big question so what's
interesting about this for axiom and for

6638
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:10,159
interesting about this for axiom and for
 

6639
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:10,870
interesting about this for axiom and for
these

6640
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:10,880
these
 

6641
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:13,189
these
commercial spaceflight areas if you can

6642
01:44:13,189 --> 01:44:13,199
commercial spaceflight areas if you can
 

6643
01:44:13,199 --> 01:44:14,629
commercial spaceflight areas if you can
fund it you could fly it right so if you

6644
01:44:14,629 --> 01:44:14,639
fund it you could fly it right so if you
 

6645
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:15,750
fund it you could fly it right so if you
have to say like i want to fly these

6646
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:15,760
have to say like i want to fly these
 

6647
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,149
have to say like i want to fly these
series of robots up because i think they

6648
01:44:18,149 --> 01:44:18,159
series of robots up because i think they
 

6649
01:44:18,159 --> 01:44:19,510
series of robots up because i think they
could help build something or they could

6650
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:19,520
could help build something or they could
 

6651
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:22,070
could help build something or they could
help measure or repair the spacecraft oh

6652
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:22,080
help measure or repair the spacecraft oh
 

6653
01:44:22,080 --> 01:44:23,350
help measure or repair the spacecraft oh
you have to come up with a good reason

6654
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:23,360
you have to come up with a good reason
 

6655
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,270
you have to come up with a good reason
yeah well for nasa you have to go group

6656
01:44:25,270 --> 01:44:25,280
yeah well for nasa you have to go group
 

6657
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,870
yeah well for nasa you have to go group
but i think for private space flight you

6658
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:26,880
but i think for private space flight you
 

6659
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,550
but i think for private space flight you
could have the reason is i'm curious and

6660
01:44:28,550 --> 01:44:28,560
could have the reason is i'm curious and
 

6661
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,390
could have the reason is i'm curious and
that could just be exactly like

6662
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:30,400
that could just be exactly like
 

6663
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:31,830
that could just be exactly like
i've got a private funder i've got your

6664
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:31,840
i've got a private funder i've got your
 

6665
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,629
i've got a private funder i've got your
own money and then you pay uh per

6666
01:44:34,629 --> 01:44:34,639
own money and then you pay uh per
 

6667
01:44:34,639 --> 01:44:36,629
own money and then you pay uh per
kilogram yeah essentially and i mean

6668
01:44:36,629 --> 01:44:36,639
kilogram yeah essentially and i mean
 

6669
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:37,910
kilogram yeah essentially and i mean
there are some things you can't say i

6670
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:37,920
there are some things you can't say i
 

6671
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,910
there are some things you can't say i
want to send a nuclear bomb up there i'm

6672
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:39,920
want to send a nuclear bomb up there i'm
 

6673
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,910
want to send a nuclear bomb up there i'm
curious i don't think that would fly but

6674
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:41,920
curious i don't think that would fly but
 

6675
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:43,830
curious i don't think that would fly but
there's probably rules in terms of

6676
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:43,840
there's probably rules in terms of
 

6677
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:46,229
there's probably rules in terms of
free-floating robots right they probably

6678
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:46,239
free-floating robots right they probably
 

6679
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,229
free-floating robots right they probably
have to be attached they have to like

6680
01:44:48,229 --> 01:44:48,239
have to be attached they have to like
 

6681
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:50,070
have to be attached they have to like
it's an orchestra that plays together

6682
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:50,080
it's an orchestra that plays together
 

6683
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,270
it's an orchestra that plays together
all the experiments that are up there

6684
01:44:51,270 --> 01:44:51,280
all the experiments that are up there
 

6685
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:52,790
all the experiments that are up there
there's probably

6686
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:52,800
there's probably
 

6687
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,030
there's probably
it's not silos it's not separate a

6688
01:44:55,030 --> 01:44:55,040
it's not silos it's not separate a
 

6689
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,470
it's not silos it's not separate a
separate kind of things but you're

6690
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:56,480
separate kind of things but you're
 

6691
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,390
separate kind of things but you're
saying it's all mostly manual how much

6692
01:44:58,390 --> 01:44:58,400
saying it's all mostly manual how much
 

6693
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,070
saying it's all mostly manual how much
electronics is there in terms of data

6694
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:00,080
electronics is there in terms of data
 

6695
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,270
electronics is there in terms of data
collection in terms of all that kind of

01:45:01,270 --> 01:45:01,280
collection in terms of all that kind of
 

6697
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:02,629
collection in terms of all that kind of
stuff a lot of electronics so a lot of

its tablets there's laptops up there

6700
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,480
its tablets there's laptops up there
 

6701
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:05,910
its tablets there's laptops up there
there are you know the whole the space

6702
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:05,920
there are you know the whole the space
 

6703
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,350
there are you know the whole the space
station is is

6704
01:45:07,350 --> 01:45:07,360
station is is
 

6705
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,629
station is is
running and humming on electronics

6706
01:45:08,629 --> 01:45:08,639
running and humming on electronics
 

6707
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:09,590
running and humming on electronics
actually it's one of the biggest

6708
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:09,600
actually it's one of the biggest
 

6709
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,430
actually it's one of the biggest
complaints astronauts have is

6710
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:11,440
complaints astronauts have is
 

6711
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:12,870
complaints astronauts have is
is sleeping up there is hard not only

6712
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:12,880
is sleeping up there is hard not only
 

6713
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:14,149
is sleeping up there is hard not only
because you're in zero gravity but

6714
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:14,159
because you're in zero gravity but
 

6715
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:16,229
because you're in zero gravity but
there's a consistent loud hum of the

6716
01:45:16,229 --> 01:45:16,239
there's a consistent loud hum of the
 

6717
01:45:16,239 --> 01:45:17,590
there's a consistent loud hum of the
space station there's so many things

6718
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:17,600
space station there's so many things
 

6719
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:19,990
space station there's so many things
active and humming and and moving

6720
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:20,000
active and humming and and moving
 

6721
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,750
active and humming and and moving
uh that are keeping this the station

6722
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:21,760
uh that are keeping this the station
 

6723
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,990
uh that are keeping this the station
alive the co2 scrubbers all the

6724
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:24,000
alive the co2 scrubbers all the
 

6725
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:25,350
alive the co2 scrubbers all the
instrumentation

6726
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:25,360
instrumentation
 

6727
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:28,149
instrumentation
it's loud so i think it is a very well

6728
01:45:28,149 --> 01:45:28,159
it's loud so i think it is a very well
 

6729
01:45:28,159 --> 01:45:29,510
it's loud so i think it is a very well
powered

6730
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:29,520
powered
 

6731
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,470
powered
uh lab basically in in flight but it but

6732
01:45:32,470 --> 01:45:32,480
uh lab basically in in flight but it but
 

6733
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,149
uh lab basically in in flight but it but
it uh and one of the future space

6734
01:45:34,149 --> 01:45:34,159
it uh and one of the future space
 

6735
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:35,430
it uh and one of the future space
stations i think will be very different

6736
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:35,440
stations i think will be very different
 

6737
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,669
stations i think will be very different
because they're being built more for

6738
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:37,679
because they're being built more for
 

6739
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,590
because they're being built more for
pleasure than business or you know a

6740
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:39,600
pleasure than business or you know a
 

6741
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,750
pleasure than business or you know a
little bit of both but they're built for

6742
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:41,760
little bit of both but they're built for
 

6743
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,350
little bit of both but they're built for
we want people to you know at least when

6744
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:43,360
we want people to you know at least when
 

6745
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:44,629
we want people to you know at least when
you talk to axiom when you talk to the

6746
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:44,639
you talk to axiom when you talk to the
 

6747
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:47,109
you talk to axiom when you talk to the
other industry partners they want to

6748
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:47,119
other industry partners they want to
 

6749
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:48,950
other industry partners they want to
make it you know space more fun and

6750
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:48,960
make it you know space more fun and
 

6751
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:51,270
make it you know space more fun and
engaging and open to new ideas so that's

6752
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:51,280
engaging and open to new ideas so that's
 

6753
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:52,709
engaging and open to new ideas so that's
looking

6754
01:45:52,709 --> 01:45:52,719
looking
 

6755
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,950
looking
at the fun stuff going on in the next

6756
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:54,960
at the fun stuff going on in the next
 

6757
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:58,790
at the fun stuff going on in the next
few years but if we zoom out once again

6758
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:58,800
few years but if we zoom out once again
 

6759
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,950
few years but if we zoom out once again
how and when do we get outside of the

6760
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:00,960
how and when do we get outside of the
 

6761
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:03,430
how and when do we get outside of the
solar system you mentioned this

6762
01:46:03,430 --> 01:46:03,440
solar system you mentioned this
 

6763
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,629
solar system you mentioned this
before or maybe you can mention the

6764
01:46:06,629 --> 01:46:06,639
before or maybe you can mention the
 

6765
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:08,709
before or maybe you can mention the
other hops we might take you know what

6766
01:46:08,709 --> 01:46:08,719
other hops we might take you know what
 

6767
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:09,510
other hops we might take you know what
let's

6768
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:09,520
let's
 

6769
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,189
let's
let's step back a little

6770
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:11,199
let's step back a little
 

6771
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:12,149
let's step back a little
and

6772
01:46:12,149 --> 01:46:12,159
and
 

6773
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:14,229
and
where are some of the fun places we

6774
01:46:14,229 --> 01:46:14,239
where are some of the fun places we
 

6775
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:16,870
where are some of the fun places we
might visit first in a semi-permanent

6776
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:16,880
might visit first in a semi-permanent
 

6777
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,870
might visit first in a semi-permanent
way inside the solar system that you

6778
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:18,880
way inside the solar system that you
 

6779
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,709
way inside the solar system that you
think are worth visiting yeah at the end

6780
01:46:20,709 --> 01:46:20,719
think are worth visiting yeah at the end
 

6781
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:22,550
think are worth visiting yeah at the end
of 500 years i'm hoping we make the big

6782
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:22,560
of 500 years i'm hoping we make the big
 

6783
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,350
of 500 years i'm hoping we make the big
launch towards another solar system

6784
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:25,360
launch towards another solar system
 

6785
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,270
launch towards another solar system
really driven by the fact that we now

6786
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:27,280
really driven by the fact that we now
 

6787
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:28,870
really driven by the fact that we now
actually have exoplanets that we know we

6788
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:28,880
actually have exoplanets that we know we
 

6789
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:30,870
actually have exoplanets that we know we
might be able to get to and survive on

6790
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:30,880
might be able to get to and survive on
 

6791
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,390
might be able to get to and survive on
whereas 20 years ago we really had

6792
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:32,400
whereas 20 years ago we really had
 

6793
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,149
whereas 20 years ago we really had
almost none certainly none that we knew

6794
01:46:34,149 --> 01:46:34,159
almost none certainly none that we knew
 

6795
01:46:34,159 --> 01:46:35,270
almost none certainly none that we knew
were habitable

6796
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:35,280
were habitable
 

6797
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,510
were habitable
and exoplanets even just just discovered

6798
01:46:37,510 --> 01:46:37,520
and exoplanets even just just discovered
 

6799
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,350
and exoplanets even just just discovered
didn't start to happen until 89 and

01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:41,510
didn't start to happen until 89 and
really the early 90s for the real

6802
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:41,520
really the early 90s for the real
 

6803
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,750
really the early 90s for the real
validated ones so you know

6804
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:43,760
validated ones so you know
 

6805
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,590
validated ones so you know
i'm hoping over the next 500 years we go

6806
01:46:45,590 --> 01:46:45,600
i'm hoping over the next 500 years we go
 

6807
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,109
i'm hoping over the next 500 years we go
from thousands of possible habitable

6808
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:47,119
from thousands of possible habitable
 

6809
01:46:47,119 --> 01:46:48,950
from thousands of possible habitable
plants to hundreds of thousands or

6810
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:48,960
plants to hundreds of thousands or
 

6811
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,470
plants to hundreds of thousands or
millions that you know especially with

6812
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:50,480
millions that you know especially with
 

6813
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,310
millions that you know especially with
some of the recent telescopes launch

6814
01:46:52,310 --> 01:46:52,320
some of the recent telescopes launch
 

6815
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,910
some of the recent telescopes launch
we'll find them but but before we get

6816
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:53,920
we'll find them but but before we get
 

6817
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:54,790
we'll find them but but before we get
there

6818
01:46:54,790 --> 01:46:54,800
there
 

6819
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:57,030
there
i have a a whole section i really

6820
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:57,040
i have a a whole section i really
 

6821
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,390
i have a a whole section i really
describe about the magic of titan

6822
01:46:58,390 --> 01:46:58,400
describe about the magic of titan
 

6823
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,470
describe about the magic of titan
because it has all this methane which is

6824
01:47:00,470 --> 01:47:00,480
because it has all this methane which is
 

6825
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,229
because it has all this methane which is
a great hydrocarbon you can use to make

6826
01:47:02,229 --> 01:47:02,239
a great hydrocarbon you can use to make
 

6827
01:47:02,239 --> 01:47:04,629
a great hydrocarbon you can use to make
fuel you can use it it's cold as all

6828
01:47:04,629 --> 01:47:04,639
fuel you can use it it's cold as all
 

6829
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:07,910
fuel you can use it it's cold as all
bejesus on titan but if you get ice it's

6830
01:47:07,910 --> 01:47:07,920
bejesus on titan but if you get ice it's
 

6831
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,070
bejesus on titan but if you get ice it's
uh yeah it's it's what so what's a titan

6832
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
uh yeah it's it's what so what's a titan
 

6833
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:12,629
uh yeah it's it's what so what's a titan
made up of what is titan oh everybody

6834
01:47:12,629 --> 01:47:12,639
made up of what is titan oh everybody
 

6835
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:15,270
made up of what is titan oh everybody
loves titan yeah it is it's a favorite

6836
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:15,280
loves titan yeah it is it's a favorite
 

6837
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:18,709
loves titan yeah it is it's a favorite
uh it's this kind of eerie uh green hued

6838
01:47:18,709 --> 01:47:18,719
uh it's this kind of eerie uh green hued
 

6839
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:22,550
uh it's this kind of eerie uh green hued
moon um that's around saturn that is

6840
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
moon um that's around saturn that is
 

6841
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,669
moon um that's around saturn that is
uh

6842
01:47:23,669 --> 01:47:23,679
uh
 

6843
01:47:23,679 --> 01:47:26,229
uh
into our knowledge you know this large

6844
01:47:26,229 --> 01:47:26,239
into our knowledge you know this large
 

6845
01:47:26,239 --> 01:47:27,430
into our knowledge you know this large
it has like you know

6846
01:47:27,430 --> 01:47:27,440
it has like you know
 

6847
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:30,310
it has like you know
it's so cold it has these methane lakes

6848
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:30,320
it's so cold it has these methane lakes
 

6849
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,990
it's so cold it has these methane lakes
where the methane normally is a gas but

6850
01:47:31,990 --> 01:47:32,000
where the methane normally is a gas but
 

6851
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,189
where the methane normally is a gas but
there would actually be so cold it's

6852
01:47:33,189 --> 01:47:33,199
there would actually be so cold it's
 

6853
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:34,950
there would actually be so cold it's
like a lake of methane you could go

6854
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:34,960
like a lake of methane you could go
 

6855
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:36,390
like a lake of methane you could go
swimming in it potentially

6856
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:36,400
swimming in it potentially
 

6857
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:38,709
swimming in it potentially
there might be some degree of rocks or

6858
01:47:38,709 --> 01:47:38,719
there might be some degree of rocks or
 

6859
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,149
there might be some degree of rocks or
maybe mountains there but they might

6860
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:40,159
maybe mountains there but they might
 

6861
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:43,189
maybe mountains there but they might
also be made of like frozen methane so

6862
01:47:43,189 --> 01:47:43,199
also be made of like frozen methane so
 

6863
01:47:43,199 --> 01:47:45,189
also be made of like frozen methane so
no one's ever no person's obviously been

6864
01:47:45,189 --> 01:47:45,199
no one's ever no person's obviously been
 

6865
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:46,629
no one's ever no person's obviously been
there but it is you have enough

6866
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:46,639
there but it is you have enough
 

6867
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:48,790
there but it is you have enough
satellite imagery and some data that you

6868
01:47:48,790 --> 01:47:48,800
satellite imagery and some data that you
 

6869
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:50,870
satellite imagery and some data that you
could actually potentially survive on

6870
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:50,880
could actually potentially survive on
 

6871
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,629
could actually potentially survive on
titan so i think that'd be one place

6872
01:47:52,629 --> 01:47:52,639
titan so i think that'd be one place
 

6873
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:53,750
titan so i think that'd be one place
where i'm hoping that we would at least

6874
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:53,760
where i'm hoping that we would at least
 

6875
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:54,950
where i'm hoping that we would at least
have

6876
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:54,960
have
 

6877
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,709
have
a bit of an outpost it might not be a

6878
01:47:56,709 --> 01:47:56,719
a bit of an outpost it might not be a
 

6879
01:47:56,719 --> 01:47:58,790
a bit of an outpost it might not be a
luxurious retreat because it's really

6880
01:47:58,790 --> 01:47:58,800
luxurious retreat because it's really
 

6881
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:01,109
luxurious retreat because it's really
cold is there a life on titan you think

6882
01:48:01,109 --> 01:48:01,119
cold is there a life on titan you think
 

6883
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:04,550
cold is there a life on titan you think
underneath the surface somewhere maybe

6884
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:04,560
underneath the surface somewhere maybe
 

6885
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,870
underneath the surface somewhere maybe
well actually with all that carbon and

6886
01:48:06,870 --> 01:48:06,880
well actually with all that carbon and
 

6887
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,709
well actually with all that carbon and
all those hydrocarbons it is very

6888
01:48:08,709 --> 01:48:08,719
all those hydrocarbons it is very
 

6889
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:10,229
all those hydrocarbons it is very
possible that some microbial life could

6890
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:10,239
possible that some microbial life could
 

6891
01:48:10,239 --> 01:48:11,990
possible that some microbial life could
be there and hanging out waiting for us

6892
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:12,000
be there and hanging out waiting for us
 

6893
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,470
be there and hanging out waiting for us
to to dip our toes into the methane and

6894
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:14,480
to to dip our toes into the methane and
 

6895
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:15,510
to to dip our toes into the methane and
find it

6896
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:15,520
find it
 

6897
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,990
find it
but we don't know yet but i think that's

6898
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:18,000
but we don't know yet but i think that's
 

6899
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,669
but we don't know yet but i think that's
one place i'd like to see an outpost i

6900
01:48:19,669 --> 01:48:19,679
one place i'd like to see an outpost i
 

6901
01:48:19,679 --> 01:48:21,669
one place i'd like to see an outpost i
would like to see other outposts near

6902
01:48:21,669 --> 01:48:21,679
would like to see other outposts near
 

6903
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:23,750
would like to see other outposts near
jupiter but jupiter has extremely high

6904
01:48:23,750 --> 01:48:23,760
jupiter but jupiter has extremely high
 

6905
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,990
jupiter but jupiter has extremely high
radiation actually so even places like

6906
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:26,000
radiation actually so even places like
 

6907
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,669
radiation actually so even places like
io which are volcanically active and

6908
01:48:27,669 --> 01:48:27,679
io which are volcanically active and
 

6909
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:29,109
io which are volcanically active and
quite amazing

6910
01:48:29,109 --> 01:48:29,119
quite amazing
 

6911
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:30,790
quite amazing
we probably couldn't survive that long

6912
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:30,800
we probably couldn't survive that long
 

6913
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:32,149
we probably couldn't survive that long
that close to jupiter though it has

6914
01:48:32,149 --> 01:48:32,159
that close to jupiter though it has
 

6915
01:48:32,159 --> 01:48:34,870
that close to jupiter though it has
because it brings such a giant planet

6916
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:34,880
because it brings such a giant planet
 

6917
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,950
because it brings such a giant planet
uh it emits back out a lot of radiation

6918
01:48:36,950 --> 01:48:36,960
uh it emits back out a lot of radiation
 

6919
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:38,629
uh it emits back out a lot of radiation
that it's collecting from other parts of

6920
01:48:38,629 --> 01:48:38,639
that it's collecting from other parts of
 

6921
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,470
that it's collecting from other parts of
the universe and it juts back out so if

6922
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:40,480
the universe and it juts back out so if
 

6923
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,550
the universe and it juts back out so if
you get too close to jupiter it'd

6924
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:42,560
you get too close to jupiter it'd
 

6925
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,149
you get too close to jupiter it'd
actually almost certainly not be able to

6926
01:48:44,149 --> 01:48:44,159
actually almost certainly not be able to
 

6927
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:46,149
actually almost certainly not be able to
survive depending on which part of it

6928
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:46,159
survive depending on which part of it
 

6929
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:47,030
survive depending on which part of it
but

6930
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:47,040
but
 

6931
01:48:47,040 --> 01:48:49,270
but
that's one risk about jupiter um but

6932
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:49,280
that's one risk about jupiter um but
 

6933
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,709
that's one risk about jupiter um but
it'd be cool to see the giant red spot

6934
01:48:50,709 --> 01:48:50,719
it'd be cool to see the giant red spot
 

6935
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:52,870
it'd be cool to see the giant red spot
uh up close maybe have some spots there

6936
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:52,880
uh up close maybe have some spots there
 

6937
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,709
uh up close maybe have some spots there
a mars stop one

6938
01:48:54,709 --> 01:48:54,719
a mars stop one
 

6939
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,310
a mars stop one
then you get to pick titan or io so ice

6940
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,320
then you get to pick titan or io so ice
 

6941
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,270
then you get to pick titan or io so ice
firing ice the robert frost poem comes

6942
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:01,280
firing ice the robert frost poem comes
 

6943
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:03,830
firing ice the robert frost poem comes
to mind yeah and then europa is that you

6944
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:03,840
to mind yeah and then europa is that you
 

6945
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:05,510
to mind yeah and then europa is that you
would be called to an enceladus which is

6946
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:05,520
would be called to an enceladus which is
 

6947
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:07,270
would be called to an enceladus which is
a big ocean it might be there like an

6948
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:07,280
a big ocean it might be there like an
 

6949
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:09,189
a big ocean it might be there like an
alien ocean that's under the uh it might

6950
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:09,199
alien ocean that's under the uh it might
 

6951
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:11,270
alien ocean that's under the uh it might
be even water ice that's there and why

6952
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,280
be even water ice that's there and why
 

6953
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,109
be even water ice that's there and why
even liquid water potentially there

6954
01:49:13,109 --> 01:49:13,119
even liquid water potentially there
 

6955
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:14,550
even liquid water potentially there
under the surface so that'd be a great

6956
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:14,560
under the surface so that'd be a great
 

6957
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,950
under the surface so that'd be a great
candidate the asteroids of ceres would

6958
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:16,960
candidate the asteroids of ceres would
 

6959
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,950
candidate the asteroids of ceres would
be good or arrows or big enough you get

6960
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:18,960
be good or arrows or big enough you get
 

6961
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,629
be good or arrows or big enough you get
a little bit of gravity

6962
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:20,639
a little bit of gravity
 

6963
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:21,990
a little bit of gravity
that they'd be interesting you could you

6964
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:22,000
that they'd be interesting you could you
 

6965
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,990
that they'd be interesting you could you
know have maybe a habitable place there

6966
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:24,000
know have maybe a habitable place there
 

6967
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,350
know have maybe a habitable place there
and they just might be big enough that

6968
01:49:25,350 --> 01:49:25,360
and they just might be big enough that
 

6969
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,030
and they just might be big enough that
you could get there survive and even

6970
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,040
you could get there survive and even
 

6971
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,709
you could get there survive and even
have a tiny bit of gravity but not much

6972
01:49:28,709 --> 01:49:28,719
have a tiny bit of gravity but not much
 

6973
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:31,189
have a tiny bit of gravity but not much
why do you like asteroids no are you

6974
01:49:31,189 --> 01:49:31,199
why do you like asteroids no are you
 

6975
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,430
why do you like asteroids no are you
just this we're just listing vacations

6976
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:33,440
just this we're just listing vacations
 

6977
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,589
just this we're just listing vacations
yeah vacation spots yes i'd say well so

6978
01:49:35,589 --> 01:49:35,599
yeah vacation spots yes i'd say well so
 

6979
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:36,709
yeah vacation spots yes i'd say well so
they probably have a lot of rare earth

6980
01:49:36,709 --> 01:49:36,719
they probably have a lot of rare earth
 

6981
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:38,070
they probably have a lot of rare earth
minerals that you could use for

6982
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,080
minerals that you could use for
 

6983
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,070
minerals that you could use for
manufacturing which is why

6984
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,080
manufacturing which is why
 

6985
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,430
manufacturing which is why
part of the space economy that's being

6986
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:41,440
part of the space economy that's being
 

6987
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:42,870
part of the space economy that's being
built up now is people really wanted to

6988
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:42,880
built up now is people really wanted to
 

6989
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,709
built up now is people really wanted to
go and hollow out the asteroids and

6990
01:49:44,709 --> 01:49:44,719
go and hollow out the asteroids and
 

6991
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:45,990
go and hollow out the asteroids and
bring back all the

6992
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:46,000
bring back all the
 

6993
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,629
bring back all the
um you know all the resources from it so

6994
01:49:48,629 --> 01:49:48,639
um you know all the resources from it so
 

6995
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:50,709
um you know all the resources from it so
this uh legally is very possible because

6996
01:49:50,709 --> 01:49:50,719
this uh legally is very possible because
 

6997
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:53,750
this uh legally is very possible because
even though um the the space space act

6998
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:53,760
even though um the the space space act
 

6999
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,070
even though um the the space space act
prevents people from militarizing space

7000
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:56,080
prevents people from militarizing space
 

7001
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,510
prevents people from militarizing space
or owning all of it

7002
01:49:57,510 --> 01:49:57,520
or owning all of it
 

7003
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,589
or owning all of it
if you get the resources out of an

7004
01:49:59,589 --> 01:49:59,599
if you get the resources out of an
 

7005
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:00,950
if you get the resources out of an
asteroid but you don't actually say you

7006
01:50:00,950 --> 01:50:00,960
asteroid but you don't actually say you
 

7007
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:02,229
asteroid but you don't actually say you
own it that's still that's perfectly

7008
01:50:02,229 --> 01:50:02,239
own it that's still that's perfectly
 

7009
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:03,189
own it that's still that's perfectly
legal

7010
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:03,199
legal
 

7011
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:05,510
legal
so you could what's the space act uh

7012
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:05,520
so you could what's the space act uh
 

7013
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,709
so you could what's the space act uh
it's basically 1967 was the first

7014
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:08,719
it's basically 1967 was the first
 

7015
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:11,189
it's basically 1967 was the first
a large-scale agreement between major

a large-scale agreement between major
 

7017
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:13,109

01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:13,119
international parties particularly the
 

7019
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:15,430
international parties particularly the
u.s and russia but also many others to

7020
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:15,440
u.s and russia but also many others to
 

7021
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:17,109
u.s and russia but also many others to
say that space should be a place for

7022
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:17,119
say that space should be a place for
 

7023
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:19,669
say that space should be a place for
humanities to not militarize it to not

7024
01:50:19,669 --> 01:50:19,679
humanities to not militarize it to not
 

7025
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:21,589
humanities to not militarize it to not
weaponize it to not militarize it also

7026
01:50:21,589 --> 01:50:21,599
weaponize it to not militarize it also
 

7027
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:22,950
weaponize it to not militarize it also
establish some of the basic sharing

01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:22,960
establish some of the basic sharing

principles between countries who are
 

7031
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,310

01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:26,320
going into space
 

7033
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,709
going into space
and there was a plan to make an

7034
01:50:28,709 --> 01:50:28,719
and there was a plan to make an
 

7035
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:30,709
and there was a plan to make an
additional act in the 90s

7036
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
additional act in the 90s

the the lunar the lunar

7038
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:32,960
the the lunar the lunar
 

7039
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,149
the the lunar the lunar
actually i'm blank on the name of what

7040
01:50:34,149 --> 01:50:34,159
actually i'm blank on the name of what
 

7041
01:50:34,159 --> 01:50:35,750
actually i'm blank on the name of what
but the uh there hasn't been any

7042
01:50:35,750 --> 01:50:35,760
but the uh there hasn't been any
 

7043
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,430
but the uh there hasn't been any
significant legislation that has been

7044
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:37,440
significant legislation that has been
 

7045
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,550
significant legislation that has been
universally accepted since the space act

7046
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:40,560
universally accepted since the space act
 

7047
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:43,189
universally accepted since the space act
so but the primary focus

7048
01:50:43,189 --> 01:50:43,199
so but the primary focus
 

7049
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:44,470
so but the primary focus
was on the militarization the

7050
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:44,480
was on the militarization the
 

7051
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,629
was on the militarization the
militarization which was in theory not

7052
01:50:46,629 --> 01:50:46,639
militarization which was in theory not
 

7053
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,109
militarization which was in theory not
allowed which will which so far has

7054
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,119
allowed which will which so far has
 

7055
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:52,070
allowed which will which so far has
stayed true but but there's no um is

7056
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:52,080
stayed true but but there's no um is
 

7057
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:56,070
stayed true but but there's no um is
there any legal framework for who owns

7058
01:50:56,070 --> 01:50:56,080
there any legal framework for who owns
 

7059
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:58,149
there any legal framework for who owns
space and space

uh

7062
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:58,880
uh
 

7063
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,870
uh
like different geographical regions of

7064
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:00,880
like different geographical regions of
 

7065
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,990
like different geographical regions of
space both out in space and on

7066
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:04,000
space both out in space and on
 

7067

asteroids and planets and moons
the currently you can't own

7070
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,280
the currently you can't own
 

7071
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,470
the currently you can't own
you're not supposed to be able to own i

7072

you're not supposed to be able to own i
 

7073
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,990
you're not supposed to be able to own i
mean people have tried to sell bits of

7074
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,000
mean people have tried to sell bits of
 

7075
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,750
mean people have tried to sell bits of
the moon for example or sell names of

7076
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:13,760
the moon for example or sell names of
 

7077
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:15,830
the moon for example or sell names of
stars which is pretty harmless but

7078
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:15,840
stars which is pretty harmless but
 

7079
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,270
stars which is pretty harmless but
you're not supposed to be able to own

7080
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:17,280
you're not supposed to be able to own
 

7081
01:51:17,280 --> 01:51:19,350
you're not supposed to be able to own
any part of the moon or an asteroid for

7082
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:19,360
any part of the moon or an asteroid for
 

7083
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:22,470
any part of the moon or an asteroid for
that matter but you're allowed to mine

7084
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:22,480
that matter but you're allowed to mine
 

7085
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,550
that matter but you're allowed to mine
the resources from it so in theory you

7086
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:24,560
the resources from it so in theory you
 

7087
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,790
the resources from it so in theory you
could go catch an asteroid hollow out

7088
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:26,800
could go catch an asteroid hollow out
 

7089
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:28,870
could go catch an asteroid hollow out
the whole thing like you eat an orange

7090
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:28,880
the whole thing like you eat an orange
 

7091
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,470
the whole thing like you eat an orange
and leave the shell

7092
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:30,480
and leave the shell
 

7093
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,470
and leave the shell
and say okay i'm done i never owned it

7094
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:32,480
and say okay i'm done i never owned it
 

7095
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:34,310
and say okay i'm done i never owned it
but i just extracted everything inside

7096
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320
but i just extracted everything inside
 

7097
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,709
but i just extracted everything inside
of it and now i'm done with it and and

7098
01:51:36,709 --> 01:51:36,719
of it and now i'm done with it and and
 

7099
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:38,470
of it and now i'm done with it and and
then

7100
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:38,480
then
 

7101
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:40,149
then
of course you see there's going to be

7102
01:51:40,149 --> 01:51:40,159
of course you see there's going to be
 

7103
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:42,229
of course you see there's going to be
some contentious battles

7104
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:42,239
some contentious battles
 

7105
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:45,750
some contentious battles
even wars over those resources

7106
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:45,760
even wars over those resources
 

7107
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:47,510
even wars over those resources
hopefully at a very small scale it's

7108
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
hopefully at a very small scale it's
 

7109
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,709
hopefully at a very small scale it's
more like conflict or like human tension

7110
01:51:50,709 --> 01:51:50,719
more like conflict or like human tension
 

7111
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:53,830
more like conflict or like human tension
but

7112
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:53,840

 

7113
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,030

oh boy

7114
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:55,040
oh boy
 

7115
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:57,750
oh boy
it's like war makes for human

7116
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:57,760
it's like war makes for human
 

7117
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,109
it's like war makes for human
flourishing like after the war somehow

7118
01:52:01,109 --> 01:52:01,119
flourishing like after the war somehow
 

7119
01:52:01,119 --> 01:52:03,350
flourishing like after the war somehow
sometimes there's just this

7120
01:52:03,350 --> 01:52:03,360
sometimes there's just this
 

7121
01:52:03,360 --> 01:52:04,870
sometimes there's just this
explosion

7122
01:52:04,870 --> 01:52:04,880
explosion
 

7123
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,550
explosion
of conflict

7124
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:06,560
of conflict
 

7125
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:09,270
of conflict
and afterwards for a long while there's

7126
01:52:09,270 --> 01:52:09,280
and afterwards for a long while there's
 

7127
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:11,270
and afterwards for a long while there's
a flourishing and again conflict and

7128
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:11,280
a flourishing and again conflict and
 

7129
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:13,350
a flourishing and again conflict and
flourishing and hopefully over a stretch

7130
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:13,360
flourishing and hopefully over a stretch
 

7131
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,070
flourishing and hopefully over a stretch
of

7132
01:52:14,070 --> 01:52:14,080
of
 

7133
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:17,350
of
uh millennia the rate of conflict and

7134
01:52:17,350 --> 01:52:17,360
uh millennia the rate of conflict and
 

7135
01:52:17,360 --> 01:52:19,189
uh millennia the rate of conflict and
the destructiveness of conflict

7136
01:52:19,189 --> 01:52:19,199
the destructiveness of conflict
 

7137
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:21,669
the destructiveness of conflict
decreases it has at least in the past

7138
01:52:21,669 --> 01:52:21,679
decreases it has at least in the past
 

7139
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:23,910
decreases it has at least in the past
hundred years the number of wars number

7140
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:23,920
hundred years the number of wars number
 

7141
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,149
hundred years the number of wars number
of military actions casualties have all

7142
01:52:26,149 --> 01:52:26,159
of military actions casualties have all
 

7143
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:27,669
of military actions casualties have all
decreased i don't know if it's gonna

7144
01:52:27,669 --> 01:52:27,679
decreased i don't know if it's gonna
 

7145
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:29,350
decreased i don't know if it's gonna
stay that way for humanity

7146
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:29,360
stay that way for humanity
 

7147
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:31,990
stay that way for humanity
going i think

7148
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:32,000
going i think
 

7149
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,669
going i think
you know the trajectory is there i think

7150
01:52:33,669 --> 01:52:33,679
you know the trajectory is there i think
 

7151
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:35,990
you know the trajectory is there i think
the the war mongering is less tolerated

7152
01:52:35,990 --> 01:52:36,000
the the war mongering is less tolerated
 

7153
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,990
the the war mongering is less tolerated
by the international community the you

7154
01:52:37,990 --> 01:52:38,000
by the international community the you
 

7155
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,830
by the international community the you
know it's more scrutinized it still

7156
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:39,840
know it's more scrutinized it still
 

7157
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,030
know it's more scrutinized it still
happens like you know right now is an

7158
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:41,040
happens like you know right now is an
 

7159
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:42,870
happens like you know right now is an
ongoing war between russia and ukraine

7160
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:42,880
ongoing war between russia and ukraine
 

7161
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,149
ongoing war between russia and ukraine
and you've spoken a lot about it and

7162
01:52:44,149 --> 01:52:44,159
and you've spoken a lot about it and
 

7163
01:52:44,159 --> 01:52:46,390
and you've spoken a lot about it and
it's you know uh

7164
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:46,400
it's you know uh
 

7165
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:47,990
it's you know uh
but it it's

7166
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:48,000
but it it's
 

7167
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,430
but it it's
you know there there are sometimes will

7168
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:49,440
you know there there are sometimes will
 

7169
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,750
you know there there are sometimes will
be small military actions but i think

7170
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:51,760
be small military actions but i think
 

7171
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:52,790
be small military actions but i think
the the

7172
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:52,800
the the
 

7173
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,310
the the
you know and even there there's a you

7174
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:54,320
you know and even there there's a you
 

7175
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,470
you know and even there there's a you
know uh large military action across

7176
01:52:56,470 --> 01:52:56,480
know uh large military action across
 

7177
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,830
know uh large military action across
most of the country but not all of it

7178
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:57,840
most of the country but not all of it
 

7179
01:52:57,840 --> 01:52:59,910
most of the country but not all of it
actually right so it's i think we see

7180
01:52:59,910 --> 01:52:59,920
actually right so it's i think we see
 

7181
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,510
actually right so it's i think we see
less over time of large-scale

7182
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:01,520
less over time of large-scale
 

7183
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,510
less over time of large-scale
multi-country invasions like like we've

7184
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:03,520
multi-country invasions like like we've
 

7185
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,950
multi-country invasions like like we've
seen in the past i think maybe that

7186
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:04,960
seen in the past i think maybe that
 

7187
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:06,390
seen in the past i think maybe that
won't happen ever again but you might

7188
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:06,400
won't happen ever again but you might
 

7189
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:07,189
won't happen ever again but you might
see

7190
01:53:07,189 --> 01:53:07,199
see
 

7191
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:09,109
see
country to country battles happening

7192
01:53:09,109 --> 01:53:09,119
country to country battles happening
 

7193
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:11,030
country to country battles happening
which has always happened i think um but

7194
01:53:11,030 --> 01:53:11,040
which has always happened i think um but
 

7195
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:13,109
which has always happened i think um but
hopefully less of that as well

7196
01:53:13,109 --> 01:53:13,119
hopefully less of that as well
 

7197
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:14,149
hopefully less of that as well
and

7198
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:14,159
and
 

7199
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,470
and
yet the destructiveness of our weapons

7200
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:16,480
yet the destructiveness of our weapons
 

7201
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,709
yet the destructiveness of our weapons
increases so it's a

7202
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:18,719
increases so it's a
 

7203
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:20,629
increases so it's a
it's it's a complicated race in both

7204
01:53:20,629 --> 01:53:20,639
it's it's a complicated race in both
 

7205
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:22,470
it's it's a complicated race in both
directions we become more peaceful and

7206
01:53:22,470 --> 01:53:22,480
directions we become more peaceful and
 

7207
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:24,229
directions we become more peaceful and
more destructive at the same time it's

7208
01:53:24,229 --> 01:53:24,239
more destructive at the same time it's
 

7209
01:53:24,239 --> 01:53:25,350
more destructive at the same time it's
fascinating

7210
01:53:25,350 --> 01:53:25,360
fascinating
 

7211
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:27,589
fascinating
how do we get outside the solar system

7212
01:53:27,589 --> 01:53:27,599
how do we get outside the solar system
 

7213
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:28,709
how do we get outside the solar system
you uh

7214
01:53:28,709 --> 01:53:28,719
you uh
 

7215
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:29,990
you uh
you write

7216
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:30,000
you write
 

7217
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:31,510
you write
an epic

7218
01:53:31,510 --> 01:53:31,520
an epic
 

7219
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:32,790
an epic
line

7220
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:32,800
line
 

7221
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:34,870
line
i believe it's the title of one of the

7222
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:34,880
i believe it's the title of one of the
 

7223
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:39,350
i believe it's the title of one of the
sections launched toward the second sun

7224
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,360

 

7225
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:40,790

that journey

7226
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:40,800
that journey
 

7227
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:42,550
that journey
of saying we're going to somehow the

7228
01:53:42,550 --> 01:53:42,560
of saying we're going to somehow the
 

7229
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,189
of saying we're going to somehow the
solar system feels like home yeah the

7230
01:53:45,189 --> 01:53:45,199
solar system feels like home yeah the
 

7231
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:47,109
solar system feels like home yeah the
earth is home but the solar system is

7232
01:53:47,109 --> 01:53:47,119
earth is home but the solar system is
 

7233
01:53:47,119 --> 01:53:50,310
earth is home but the solar system is
home it's our sun the sun is a source of

7234
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:50,320
home it's our sun the sun is a source of
 

7235
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,629
home it's our sun the sun is a source of
of uh life yeah

7236
01:53:52,629 --> 01:53:52,639
of uh life yeah
 

7237
01:53:52,639 --> 01:53:55,350
of uh life yeah
and going towards the second son leaving

7238
01:53:55,350 --> 01:53:55,360
and going towards the second son leaving
 

7239
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,870
and going towards the second son leaving
this home behind

7240
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:56,880
this home behind
 

7241
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,430
this home behind
that's that's one hell of a journey yeah

7242
01:53:59,430 --> 01:53:59,440
that's that's one hell of a journey yeah
 

7243
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:00,470
that's that's one hell of a journey yeah
so

7244
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:00,480
so
 

7245
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:02,470
so
what does that journey look like when

7246
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:02,480
what does that journey look like when
 

7247
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:04,629
what does that journey look like when
when does it happen and what's required

7248
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
when does it happen and what's required
 

7249
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,229
when does it happen and what's required
to make it happen

7250
01:54:06,229 --> 01:54:06,239
to make it happen
 

7251
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:08,310
to make it happen
to get to that state we have to actually

7252
01:54:08,310 --> 01:54:08,320
to get to that state we have to actually
 

7253
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,229
to get to that state we have to actually
have you know i describe a number of

7254
01:54:10,229 --> 01:54:10,239
have you know i describe a number of
 

7255
01:54:10,239 --> 01:54:11,350
have you know i describe a number of
options either we have to all have

7256
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:11,360
options either we have to all have
 

7257
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:13,109
options either we have to all have
people survive and multiple generations

7258
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:13,119
people survive and multiple generations
 

7259
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:14,629
people survive and multiple generations
live and die on the same spacecraft

7260
01:54:14,629 --> 01:54:14,639
live and die on the same spacecraft
 

7261
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:16,629
live and die on the same spacecraft
towards another another star

7262
01:54:16,629 --> 01:54:16,639
towards another another star
 

7263
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:18,550
towards another another star
propulsion technology you need to have

7264
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:18,560
propulsion technology you need to have
 

7265
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,629
propulsion technology you need to have
that in place i assume we don't have

7266
01:54:20,629 --> 01:54:20,639
that in place i assume we don't have
 

7267
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:22,709
that in place i assume we don't have
dramatic improvements i describe ways

7268
01:54:22,709 --> 01:54:22,719
dramatic improvements i describe ways
 

7269
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:23,990
dramatic improvements i describe ways
that could happen like anti-matter

7270
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:24,000
that could happen like anti-matter
 

7271
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,270
that could happen like anti-matter
drives or things that could make it

7272
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:25,280
drives or things that could make it
 

7273
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,030
drives or things that could make it
possible to go faster

7274
01:54:27,030 --> 01:54:27,040
possible to go faster
 

7275
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:29,430
possible to go faster
but since it's a book of non-fiction i

7276
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:29,440
but since it's a book of non-fiction i
 

7277
01:54:29,440 --> 01:54:31,510
but since it's a book of non-fiction i
just make no big leaps other than what

7278
01:54:31,510 --> 01:54:31,520
just make no big leaps other than what
 

7279
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,430
just make no big leaps other than what
we know of today that's possible and if

7280
01:54:33,430 --> 01:54:33,440
we know of today that's possible and if
 

7281
01:54:33,440 --> 01:54:35,510
we know of today that's possible and if
that's the case you'd need probably 20

7282
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:35,520
that's the case you'd need probably 20
 

7283
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,189
that's the case you'd need probably 20
generations to live and die on one

7284
01:54:37,189 --> 01:54:37,199
generations to live and die on one
 

7285
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:39,270
generations to live and die on one
spacecraft to make it towards what is

7286
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:39,280
spacecraft to make it towards what is
 

7287
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,669
spacecraft to make it towards what is
our known closest habitable exoplanet

7288
01:54:41,669 --> 01:54:41,679
our known closest habitable exoplanet
 

7289
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:43,189
our known closest habitable exoplanet
now that sounds

7290
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:43,199
now that sounds
 

7291
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:44,229
now that sounds
you know so you need to have the life

7292
01:54:44,229 --> 01:54:44,239
you know so you need to have the life
 

7293
01:54:44,239 --> 01:54:45,189
you know so you need to have the life
support self-reliance

7294
01:54:45,189 --> 01:54:45,199
support self-reliance
 

7295
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:46,790
support self-reliance
self-sustainability all in that one it'd

7296
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:46,800
self-sustainability all in that one it'd
 

7297
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,550
self-sustainability all in that one it'd
be a large spacecraft you'd have to grow

7298
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:48,560
be a large spacecraft you'd have to grow
 

7299
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,990
be a large spacecraft you'd have to grow
your own food probably still have some

7300
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:50,000
your own food probably still have some
 

7301
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:51,430
your own food probably still have some
areas with gravity

7302
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:51,440
areas with gravity
 

7303
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,950
areas with gravity
it would be complicated but i think

7304
01:54:52,950 --> 01:54:52,960
it would be complicated but i think
 

7305
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:54,790
it would be complicated but i think
after 500 years we could actually have

7306
01:54:54,790 --> 01:54:54,800
after 500 years we could actually have
 

7307
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,629
after 500 years we could actually have
the technology and the means and the

7308
01:54:56,629 --> 01:54:56,639
the technology and the means and the
 

7309
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:59,350
the technology and the means and the
understanding of biology to enable that

7310
01:54:59,350 --> 01:54:59,360
understanding of biology to enable that
 

7311
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:01,350
understanding of biology to enable that
and and so with that as a backdrop you

7312
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:01,360
and and so with that as a backdrop you
 

7313
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:02,709
and and so with that as a backdrop you
could have people hibernate and talk

7314
01:55:02,709 --> 01:55:02,719
could have people hibernate and talk
 

7315
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:04,070
could have people hibernate and talk
about like maybe you need to hibernate

7316
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:04,080
about like maybe you need to hibernate
 

7317
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,589
about like maybe you need to hibernate
instead of just people living their

7318
01:55:05,589 --> 01:55:05,599
instead of just people living their
 

7319
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:07,270
instead of just people living their
normal life but i think we don't the

7320
01:55:07,270 --> 01:55:07,280
normal life but i think we don't the
 

7321
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:08,870
normal life but i think we don't the
hibernation technology doesn't work that

7322
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:08,880
hibernation technology doesn't work that
 

7323
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,790
hibernation technology doesn't work that
well yet i don't know if it might pan

7324
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
well yet i don't know if it might pan
 

7325
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,550
well yet i don't know if it might pan
out and maybe in 200 years it gets

7326
01:55:12,550 --> 01:55:12,560
out and maybe in 200 years it gets
 

7327
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:13,669
out and maybe in 200 years it gets
really good then people can all just

7328
01:55:13,669 --> 01:55:13,679
really good then people can all just
 

7329
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:15,030
really good then people can all just
sleep in pods

7330
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,040
sleep in pods
 

7331
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,109
sleep in pods
great you know so i'm i i think this is

7332
01:55:17,109 --> 01:55:17,119
great you know so i'm i i think this is
 

7333
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,189
great you know so i'm i i think this is
the the minimum viable product with

7334
01:55:19,189 --> 01:55:19,199
the the minimum viable product with
 

7335
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:20,709
the the minimum viable product with
everything that we have today and

7336
01:55:20,709 --> 01:55:20,719
everything that we have today and
 

7337
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:22,870
everything that we have today and
nothing else right so if that's the case

7338
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:22,880
nothing else right so if that's the case
 

7339
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:23,990
nothing else right so if that's the case
which of course i'm sure of more than

7340
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:24,000
which of course i'm sure of more than
 

7341
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:25,350
which of course i'm sure of more than
500 years but based on what we know

7342
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:25,360
500 years but based on what we know
 

7343
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,030
500 years but based on what we know
today you have people live and die on

7344
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:27,040
today you have people live and die on
 

7345
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,470
today you have people live and die on
the spacecraft and that sounds almost

7346
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:28,480
the spacecraft and that sounds almost
 

7347
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,149
the spacecraft and that sounds almost
like a prison sentence you say

7348
01:55:30,149 --> 01:55:30,159
like a prison sentence you say
 

7349
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:32,229
like a prison sentence you say
if you were born into a spacecraft and

7350
01:55:32,229 --> 01:55:32,239
if you were born into a spacecraft and
 

7351
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:33,589
if you were born into a spacecraft and
and when you got old enough they just

7352
01:55:33,589 --> 01:55:33,599
and when you got old enough they just
 

7353
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:35,589
and when you got old enough they just
said we're yes you can tell we're on a

7354
01:55:35,589 --> 01:55:35,599
said we're yes you can tell we're on a
 

7355
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:37,510
said we're yes you can tell we're on a
spacecraft we you will live your whole

7356
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:37,520
spacecraft we you will live your whole
 

7357
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:39,189
spacecraft we you will live your whole
life on this let's say something the

7358
01:55:39,189 --> 01:55:39,199
life on this let's say something the
 

7359
01:55:39,199 --> 01:55:40,629
life on this let's say something the
size of a building

7360
01:55:40,629 --> 01:55:40,639
size of a building
 

7361
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:42,870
size of a building
and this is everyone you'll ever know

7362
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:42,880
and this is everyone you'll ever know
 

7363
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,149
and this is everyone you'll ever know
and then you'll die and then your

7364
01:55:44,149 --> 01:55:44,159
and then you'll die and then your
 

7365
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:46,070
and then you'll die and then your
children will also carry on the mission

7366
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:46,080
children will also carry on the mission
 

7367
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:47,830
children will also carry on the mission
would those people feel

7368
01:55:47,830 --> 01:55:47,840
would those people feel
 

7369
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:50,310
would those people feel
proud and excited to say we are the the

7370
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:50,320
proud and excited to say we are the the
 

7371
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,629
proud and excited to say we are the the
vanguard and hope of humanity we're

7372
01:55:52,629 --> 01:55:52,639
vanguard and hope of humanity we're
 

7373
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:54,390
vanguard and hope of humanity we're
going towards a new son

7374
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:54,400
going towards a new son
 

7375
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,910
going towards a new son
and maybe they'd love it or would they

7376
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:55,920
and maybe they'd love it or would they
 

7377
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:57,510
and maybe they'd love it or would they
after 10 generations maybe they would

7378
01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:57,520
after 10 generations maybe they would
 

7379
01:55:57,520 --> 01:55:59,589
after 10 generations maybe they would
rebel and say to hell with this i'm

7380
01:55:59,589 --> 01:55:59,599
rebel and say to hell with this i'm
 

7381
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:01,270
rebel and say to hell with this i'm
tired of being in this prison this is a

7382
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:01,280
tired of being in this prison this is a
 

7383
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:02,629
tired of being in this prison this is a
bad idea

7384
01:56:02,629 --> 01:56:02,639
bad idea
 

7385
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:04,149
bad idea
we're turning around or we're going

7386
01:56:04,149 --> 01:56:04,159
we're turning around or we're going
 

7387
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:05,750
we're turning around or we're going
somewhere else or a mutiny happens and

7388
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:05,760
somewhere else or a mutiny happens and
 

7389
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,589
somewhere else or a mutiny happens and
they kill each other right so

7390
01:56:07,589 --> 01:56:07,599
they kill each other right so
 

7391
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:08,709
they kill each other right so
we would have to really make sure that

7392
01:56:08,709 --> 01:56:08,719
we would have to really make sure that
 

7393
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:10,390
we would have to really make sure that
the mental health the structure the

7394
01:56:10,390 --> 01:56:10,400
the mental health the structure the
 

7395
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:12,070
the mental health the structure the
societies built so they could sustain

7396
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:12,080
societies built so they could sustain
 

7397
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,390
societies built so they could sustain
that mission that's a crazy mission but

7398
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:14,400
that mission that's a crazy mission but
 

7399
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,070
that mission that's a crazy mission but
it's not that much different from

7400
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:16,080
it's not that much different from
 

7401
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,589
it's not that much different from
spaceship earth right here we are stuck

7402
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:17,599
spaceship earth right here we are stuck
 

7403
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:19,350
spaceship earth right here we are stuck
on one planet we don't have planetary

7404
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:19,360
on one planet we don't have planetary
 

7405
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:20,950
on one planet we don't have planetary
liberty we can't go to another planet

7406
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:20,960
liberty we can't go to another planet
 

7407
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,550
liberty we can't go to another planet
right now we can't even really go to

7408
01:56:22,550 --> 01:56:22,560
right now we can't even really go to
 

7409
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:24,310
right now we can't even really go to
another moon that easily

7410
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:24,320
another moon that easily
 

7411
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:25,189
another moon that easily
so we

7412
01:56:25,189 --> 01:56:25,199
so we
 

7413
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:27,189
so we
and we i love earth there's lots of

7414
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:27,199
and we i love earth there's lots of
 

7415
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:28,310
and we i love earth there's lots of
wonderful things here but it's still

7416
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:28,320
wonderful things here but it's still
 

7417
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:29,830
wonderful things here but it's still
just this one planet and we're stuck on

7418
01:56:29,830 --> 01:56:29,840
just this one planet and we're stuck on
 

7419
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,669
just this one planet and we're stuck on
it so everyone that you know and love

7420
01:56:31,669 --> 01:56:31,679
it so everyone that you know and love
 

7421
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,229
it so everyone that you know and love
and live with here will be dead someday

7422
01:56:34,229 --> 01:56:34,239
and live with here will be dead someday
 

7423
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:36,470
and live with here will be dead someday
and that's all you'll ever know too so i

7424
01:56:36,470 --> 01:56:36,480
and that's all you'll ever know too so i
 

7425
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,310
and that's all you'll ever know too so i
think it's a difference of scale not a

7426
01:56:38,310 --> 01:56:38,320
think it's a difference of scale not a
 

7427
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,910
think it's a difference of scale not a
difference of type in terms of an

7428
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:39,920
difference of type in terms of an
 

7429
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,070
difference of type in terms of an
experience it's still a spaceship

7430
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:42,080
experience it's still a spaceship
 

7431
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:43,990
experience it's still a spaceship
traveling out in space earth is still a

7432
01:56:43,990 --> 01:56:44,000
traveling out in space earth is still a
 

7433
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,070
traveling out in space earth is still a
spaceship traveling out of space

7434
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:46,080
spaceship traveling out of space
 

7435
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,430
spaceship traveling out of space
so

7436
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:47,440
so
 

7437
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,589
so
it is a kind of prison

7438
01:56:49,589 --> 01:56:49,599
it is a kind of prison
 

7439
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:50,790
it is a kind of prison
it's always

7440
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:50,800
it's always
 

7441
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:53,030
it's always
everybody lives in a prison well let's

7442
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:53,040
everybody lives in a prison well let's
 

7443
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:54,870
everybody lives in a prison well let's
say it's a limited planetary experience

7444
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
say it's a limited planetary experience
 

7445
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,390
say it's a limited planetary experience
we'll say it's like that like

7446
01:56:56,390 --> 01:56:56,400
we'll say it's like that like
 

7447
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,109
we'll say it's like that like
yeah prison's not so dark but but

7448
01:56:59,109 --> 01:56:59,119
yeah prison's not so dark but but
 

7449
01:56:59,119 --> 01:57:01,990
yeah prison's not so dark but but
just yeah just like prison is a

7450
01:57:01,990 --> 01:57:02,000
just yeah just like prison is a
 

7451
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,229
just yeah just like prison is a
there's a limited geographic

7452
01:57:04,229 --> 01:57:04,239
there's a limited geographic
 

7453
01:57:04,239 --> 01:57:06,629
there's a limited geographic
and culinary experience

7454
01:57:06,629 --> 01:57:06,639
and culinary experience
 

7455
01:57:06,639 --> 01:57:07,830
and culinary experience
but i don't want it to be viewed that

7456
01:57:07,830 --> 01:57:07,840
but i don't want it to be viewed that
 

7457
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:09,589
but i don't want it to be viewed that
way i want to think wait this is what an

7458
01:57:09,589 --> 01:57:09,599
way i want to think wait this is what an
 

7459
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:11,030
way i want to think wait this is what an
extraordinary gift and we wouldn't

7460
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:11,040
extraordinary gift and we wouldn't
 

7461
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,470
extraordinary gift and we wouldn't
probably just launch one generation ship

7462
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:12,480
probably just launch one generation ship
 

7463
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,070
probably just launch one generation ship
we'd probably launch 10 or 20 of them to

7464
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:14,080
we'd probably launch 10 or 20 of them to
 

7465
01:57:14,080 --> 01:57:16,229
we'd probably launch 10 or 20 of them to
different the best candidates

7466
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:16,239
different the best candidates
 

7467
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:17,589
different the best candidates
and hopefully get there

7468
01:57:17,589 --> 01:57:17,599
and hopefully get there
 

7469
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,109
and hopefully get there
and yeah i mean

7470
01:57:19,109 --> 01:57:19,119
and yeah i mean
 

7471
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:21,669
and yeah i mean
the the fact is limitations and

7472
01:57:21,669 --> 01:57:21,679
the the fact is limitations and
 

7473
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:23,910
the the fact is limitations and
constraints make

7474
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:23,920
constraints make
 

7475
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,629
constraints make
life fascinating because the human mind

7476
01:57:26,629 --> 01:57:26,639
life fascinating because the human mind
 

7477
01:57:26,639 --> 01:57:28,070
life fascinating because the human mind
somehow struggles against those

7478
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:28,080
somehow struggles against those
 

7479
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:30,070
somehow struggles against those
constraints and that's how beauty is

7480
01:57:30,070 --> 01:57:30,080
constraints and that's how beauty is
 

7481
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,750
constraints and that's how beauty is
created so

7482
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:31,760
created so
 

7483
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,070
created so
there is kind of a threshold you know

7484
01:57:34,070 --> 01:57:34,080
there is kind of a threshold you know
 

7485
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,629
there is kind of a threshold you know
being stuck in one room

7486
01:57:36,629 --> 01:57:36,639
being stuck in one room
 

7487
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:38,229
being stuck in one room
is different than being stuck in a

7488
01:57:38,229 --> 01:57:38,239
is different than being stuck in a
 

7489
01:57:38,239 --> 01:57:39,589
is different than being stuck in a
building

7490
01:57:39,589 --> 01:57:39,599
building
 

7491
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:42,390
building
uh and being stuck in a in a city being

7492
01:57:42,390 --> 01:57:42,400
uh and being stuck in a in a city being
 

7493
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:44,229
uh and being stuck in a in a city being
stuck in like i wonder what the

7494
01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:44,239
stuck in like i wonder what the
 

7495
01:57:44,239 --> 01:57:46,709
stuck in like i wonder what the
threshold of people

7496
01:57:46,709 --> 01:57:46,719
threshold of people
 

7497
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:47,910
threshold of people
like um

7498
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:47,920
like um
 

7499
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:50,229
like um
yeah i i lived for a long time in a

7500
01:57:50,229 --> 01:57:50,239
yeah i i lived for a long time in a
 

7501
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:53,350
yeah i i lived for a long time in a
studio and then i upgraded gloriously to

7502
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:53,360
studio and then i upgraded gloriously to
 

7503
01:57:53,360 --> 01:57:55,750
studio and then i upgraded gloriously to
a one-bedroom apartment

7504
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:55,760
a one-bedroom apartment
 

7505
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:58,229
a one-bedroom apartment
and the power to be able to like

7506
01:57:58,229 --> 01:57:58,239
and the power to be able to like
 

7507
01:57:58,239 --> 01:58:00,149
and the power to be able to like
close the door

7508
01:58:00,149 --> 01:58:00,159
close the door
 

7509
01:58:00,159 --> 01:58:03,270
close the door
was magnificent right it's just like

7510
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:03,280
was magnificent right it's just like
 

7511
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,189
was magnificent right it's just like
wow you can speak

7512
01:58:05,189 --> 01:58:05,199
wow you can speak
 

7513
01:58:05,199 --> 01:58:07,750
wow you can speak
volumes it's like you can escape that

7514
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:07,760
volumes it's like you can escape that
 

7515
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,430
volumes it's like you can escape that
feels like freedom that's the definition

7516
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:09,440
feels like freedom that's the definition
 

7517
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:12,070
feels like freedom that's the definition
of freedom having a door

7518
01:58:12,070 --> 01:58:12,080
of freedom having a door
 

7519
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,310
of freedom having a door
where you could close it

7520
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:14,320
where you could close it
 

7521
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,709
where you could close it
and now you're alone with your thoughts

7522
01:58:16,709 --> 01:58:16,719
and now you're alone with your thoughts
 

7523
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:17,990
and now you're alone with your thoughts
and then you can

7524
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,000
and then you can
 

7525
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,550
and then you can
open it and you enter and now there's

7526
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:20,560
open it and you enter and now there's
 

7527
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,430
open it and you enter and now there's
other

7528
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:21,440
other
 

7529
01:58:21,440 --> 01:58:24,390
other
humans as freedom so the the threshold

7530
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:24,400
humans as freedom so the the threshold
 

7531
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:26,550
humans as freedom so the the threshold
of what freedom the experience of

7532
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:26,560
of what freedom the experience of
 

7533
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:29,109
of what freedom the experience of
freedom is like is is really fascinating

7534
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:29,119
freedom is like is is really fascinating
 

7535
01:58:29,119 --> 01:58:30,070
freedom is like is is really fascinating
and like you said there could be

7536
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:30,080
and like you said there could be
 

7537
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:32,310
and like you said there could be
technologies in terms of hibernation

7538
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:32,320
technologies in terms of hibernation
 

7539
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,229
technologies in terms of hibernation
vr you know ultra reality virtual

7540
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:34,239
vr you know ultra reality virtual
 

7541
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:35,189
vr you know ultra reality virtual
reality like

7542
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:35,199
reality like
 

7543
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:37,030
reality like
because you know 30 years ago they

7544
01:58:37,030 --> 01:58:37,040
because you know 30 years ago they
 

7545
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:38,229
because you know 30 years ago they
sounded awful i think they think you'd

7546
01:58:38,229 --> 01:58:38,239
sounded awful i think they think you'd
 

7547
01:58:38,239 --> 01:58:39,589
sounded awful i think they think you'd
be stuck in a spacecraft but now you can

7548
01:58:39,589 --> 01:58:39,599
be stuck in a spacecraft but now you can
 

7549
01:58:39,599 --> 01:58:41,030
be stuck in a spacecraft but now you can
bring the totality of all of humans

7550
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:41,040
bring the totality of all of humans
 

7551
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,350
bring the totality of all of humans
history culture every every music every

7552
01:58:43,350 --> 01:58:43,360
history culture every every music every
 

7553
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:45,990
history culture every every music every
bit of music song every movie every book

7554
01:58:45,990 --> 01:58:46,000
bit of music song every movie every book
 

7555
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,669
bit of music song every movie every book
can all be on one tablet basically right

7556
01:58:47,669 --> 01:58:47,679
can all be on one tablet basically right
 

7557
01:58:47,679 --> 01:58:48,470
can all be on one tablet basically right
so

7558
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:48,480
so
 

7559
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:50,390
so
and also you'd still get up updates from

7560
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:50,400
and also you'd still get up updates from
 

7561
01:58:50,400 --> 01:58:51,750
and also you'd still get up updates from
netflix if you're on the way towards

7562
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:51,760
netflix if you're on the way towards
 

7563
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:53,270
netflix if you're on the way towards
another star you can still get downloads

7564
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:53,280
another star you can still get downloads
 

7565
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:54,950
another star you can still get downloads
and so but eventually maybe the crew

7566
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:54,960
and so but eventually maybe the crew
 

7567
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,229
and so but eventually maybe the crew
would start to make their own shows i'd

7568
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:56,239
would start to make their own shows i'd
 

7569
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:57,270
would start to make their own shows i'd
be like well i don't want the earth

7570
01:58:57,270 --> 01:58:57,280
be like well i don't want the earth
 

7571
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:58,390
be like well i don't want the earth
shows i want to talk about i'm going to

7572
01:58:58,390 --> 01:58:58,400
shows i want to talk about i'm going to
 

7573
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:00,950
shows i want to talk about i'm going to
make a drama on this spacecraft

7574
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:00,960
make a drama on this spacecraft
 

7575
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:01,910
make a drama on this spacecraft
but i think it would have to be big

7576
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:01,920
but i think it would have to be big
 

7577
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,030
but i think it would have to be big
enough so it feels like at least the

7578
01:59:03,030 --> 01:59:03,040
enough so it feels like at least the
 

7579
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:05,109
enough so it feels like at least the
size of the building i think people's

7580
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:05,119
size of the building i think people's
 

7581
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:06,790
size of the building i think people's
intuitions about quarantining have

7582
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:06,800
intuitions about quarantining have
 

7583
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:09,109
intuitions about quarantining have
really become very uh immediate because

7584
01:59:09,109 --> 01:59:09,119
really become very uh immediate because
 

7585
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:10,390
really become very uh immediate because
we've all had to experience it to some

7586
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:10,400
we've all had to experience it to some
 

7587
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,910
we've all had to experience it to some
degree in the past two years

7588
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:11,920
degree in the past two years
 

7589
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:13,430
degree in the past two years

you're hungry you go outside and you lay
 

7647
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,070
you're hungry you go outside and you lay
out your skin and then you absorb

7648
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:06,080
out your skin and then you absorb
 

7649
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,189
out your skin and then you absorb
sunlight and then you go back in when

7650

sunlight and then you go back in when
 

7651
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:08,310

you get full
 

7653
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,390

tennis courts worth of skin that you

7662
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:17,840
tennis courts worth of skin that you
 

7663
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:19,109
tennis courts worth of skin that you
could lay out

7664
02:00:19,109 --> 02:00:19,119
could lay out
 

7665
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:20,550
could lay out
and maybe your friends would plant or

7666
02:00:20,550 --> 02:00:20,560
and maybe your friends would plant or
 

7667
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,589
and maybe your friends would plant or
something but if they plant it then

7668
02:00:21,589 --> 02:00:21,599
something but if they plant it then
 

7669
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:22,950
something but if they plant it then
their shadows would block your sun so

7670
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:22,960
their shadows would block your sun so
 

7671
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:24,550
their shadows would block your sun so
maybe leave your skin out there and you

7672
02:00:24,550 --> 02:00:24,560
maybe leave your skin out there and you
 

7673
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:26,790
maybe leave your skin out there and you
could roll up your skin go back inside

7674
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:26,800
could roll up your skin go back inside
 

7675
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,149
could roll up your skin go back inside
after about one hour and that's how much

7676
02:00:28,149 --> 02:00:28,159
after about one hour and that's how much
 

7677
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:30,149
after about one hour and that's how much
skin you would need to have exposed

so it's just kind of a fun concept in
 

7687

laying it out efficiently like is there
it sounds absurd but

02:00:53,109 --> 02:00:53,119
it sounds absurd but
 

7703
02:00:53,119 --> 02:00:54,629
it sounds absurd but
you could roll it up it would be or you

7704
02:00:54,629 --> 02:00:54,639
you could roll it up it would be or you
 

7705
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:55,910
you could roll it up it would be or you
could just lay outside longer i want to

think if you just need to have one hour
 

7709
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,870
think if you just need to have one hour
and how much game would you need but if

7710
02:00:58,870 --> 02:00:58,880
and how much game would you need but if
 

7711
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,390
and how much game would you need but if
you just went out there for

7712
02:01:00,390 --> 02:01:00,400
you just went out there for
 

7713
02:01:00,400 --> 02:01:01,510
you just went out there for
four hours you need something that's

7714
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:01,520
four hours you need something that's
 

7715
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,669
four hours you need something that's
smaller but you know think of you know

says of a half of a tennis court so you

7718
02:01:04,950 --> 02:01:04,960
says of a half of a tennis court so you
 

7719
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:07,350
says of a half of a tennis court so you
could make it like wings could be like

7720
02:01:07,350 --> 02:01:07,360
could make it like wings could be like
 

7721
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:09,350
could make it like wings could be like
and you lay them out there and but but

7722
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:09,360
and you lay them out there and but but
 

7723
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:11,510
and you lay them out there and but but
also if you that's if you need all your

7724
02:01:11,510 --> 02:01:11,520
also if you that's if you need all your
 

7725
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:13,189
also if you that's if you need all your
energy only from your skin so if you

7726
02:01:13,189 --> 02:01:13,199
energy only from your skin so if you
 

7727
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:14,550
energy only from your skin so if you
just get a little bit of it your energy

7728
02:01:14,550 --> 02:01:14,560
just get a little bit of it your energy
 

7729
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:15,910
just get a little bit of it your energy
of course you could just walk around

7730
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:15,920
of course you could just walk around
 

7731
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,589
of course you could just walk around
with your skin as is and you still have

7732
02:01:17,589 --> 02:01:17,599
with your skin as is and you still have
 

7733
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:19,589
with your skin as is and you still have
to eat but not as much and i described

7734
02:01:19,589 --> 02:01:19,599
to eat but not as much and i described
 

7735
02:01:19,599 --> 02:01:22,070
to eat but not as much and i described
that because we'd need other ways to

that because we'd need other ways to
think about

7738
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:23,119
think about
 

7739
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:24,310
think about
making your own energy if you're on a

02:01:26,870 --> 02:01:26,880
stars you could turn on a lamp that
 

7745
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:28,229
stars you could turn on a lamp that
would give you some of that you know

7746
02:01:28,229 --> 02:01:28,239
would give you some of that you know
 

7747
02:01:28,239 --> 02:01:29,990
would give you some of that you know
essentially exact wavelength of light

02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,000
essentially exact wavelength of light
 

7749
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,510
essentially exact wavelength of light
you need for your

7750
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:31,520
you need for your
 

7751
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:34,229
you need for your
chloroplast and your skin

7752
02:01:34,229 --> 02:01:34,239
chloroplast and your skin
 

7753
02:01:34,239 --> 02:01:35,990
chloroplast and your skin
but it's you know that's something i'm

7754
02:01:35,990 --> 02:01:36,000
but it's you know that's something i'm
 

7755
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:37,510
but it's you know that's something i'm
hoping would happen in three to four

7756
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:37,520
hoping would happen in three to four
 

7757
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:39,270
hoping would happen in three to four
hundred years but it would be

7758
02:01:39,270 --> 02:01:39,280
hundred years but it would be
 

7759
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:41,510
hundred years but it would be
hard because you're taking a plant

7760
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:41,520
hard because you're taking a plant
 

7761
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:42,870
hard because you're taking a plant
organelle and putting it into animal

7762
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:42,880
organelle and putting it into animal
 

7763
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,550
organelle and putting it into animal
cell which sounds weird but we have

7764
02:01:44,550 --> 02:01:44,560
cell which sounds weird but we have
 

7765
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:45,830
cell which sounds weird but we have
mitochondria inside of us which

7766
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:45,840
mitochondria inside of us which
 

7767
02:01:45,840 --> 02:01:47,350
mitochondria inside of us which
basically where our cells capture the

7768
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:47,360
basically where our cells capture the
 

7769
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,030
basically where our cells capture the
bacteria and now it walks around with us

7770
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:49,040
bacteria and now it walks around with us
 

7771
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:50,870
bacteria and now it walks around with us
all the time so there's precedent for an

7772
02:01:50,870 --> 02:01:50,880
all the time so there's precedent for an
 

7773
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:52,629
all the time so there's precedent for an
evolution

7774

how much by the way speaking of which

7776
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:54,800
how much by the way speaking of which
 

7777
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:57,830
how much by the way speaking of which
does evolution help us here so

7778
02:01:57,830 --> 02:01:57,840
does evolution help us here so
 

7779
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:00,070
does evolution help us here so
we talked a lot about engineering you

7780
02:02:00,070 --> 02:02:00,080
we talked a lot about engineering you
 

7781
02:02:00,080 --> 02:02:02,149
we talked a lot about engineering you
know building

7782
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:02,159
know building
 

7783
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:04,709
know building
you know genetically modifying humans

7784
02:02:04,709 --> 02:02:04,719
you know genetically modifying humans
 

7785
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:07,030
you know genetically modifying humans
to make it more resilient or having

7786
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:07,040
to make it more resilient or having
 

7787
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:11,270
to make it more resilient or having
mechanisms for repairing parts of humans

7788
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:11,280
mechanisms for repairing parts of humans
 

7789
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:14,550
mechanisms for repairing parts of humans
um what about evolving humans or

7790
02:02:14,550 --> 02:02:14,560
um what about evolving humans or
 

7791
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:17,830
um what about evolving humans or
evolving organisms that live on humans

7792
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:17,840
evolving organisms that live on humans
 

7793
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:20,070
evolving organisms that live on humans
sort of the thing you mentioned

7794
02:02:20,070 --> 02:02:20,080
sort of the thing you mentioned
 

7795
02:02:20,080 --> 02:02:21,910
sort of the thing you mentioned
which you've already learned is that

7796
02:02:21,910 --> 02:02:21,920
which you've already learned is that
 

7797
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:23,910
which you've already learned is that
humans are pretty adaptable now what

7798
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:23,920
humans are pretty adaptable now what
 

7799
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,070
humans are pretty adaptable now what
does that mean you also

7800
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:26,080
does that mean you also
 

7801
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:27,030
does that mean you also
um

7802
02:02:27,030 --> 02:02:27,040
um
 

7803
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:28,709
um
somewhere wrote that you know there's

7804
02:02:28,709 --> 02:02:28,719
somewhere wrote that you know there's
 

7805
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:30,149
somewhere wrote that you know there's
trillions of cells that make up the

7806
02:02:30,149 --> 02:02:30,159
trillions of cells that make up the
 

7807
02:02:30,159 --> 02:02:31,669
trillions of cells that make up the
human body

7808
02:02:31,669 --> 02:02:31,679
human body
 

7809
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:33,830
human body
and you know those are all organisms and

7810
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:33,840
and you know those are all organisms and
 

7811
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:36,310
and you know those are all organisms and
they're also very adaptable

7812
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:36,320
they're also very adaptable
 

7813
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,790
they're also very adaptable
so can we leverage the natural process

7814
02:02:38,790 --> 02:02:38,800
so can we leverage the natural process
 

7815
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:40,229
so can we leverage the natural process
of evolution

7816
02:02:40,229 --> 02:02:40,239
of evolution

there it's just just acknowledging that
 

7825
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:50,950
there it's just just acknowledging that
a lot of organisms have to die

7826
02:02:50,950 --> 02:02:50,960
a lot of organisms have to die
 

7827
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,790
a lot of organisms have to die
in evolution uh

in evolution uh
 

7829
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,950
in evolution uh
can we use that

7830
02:02:54,950 --> 02:02:54,960
can we use that
 

7831
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:57,030
can we use that
for long term

7832
02:02:57,030 --> 02:02:57,040
for long term
 

7833
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:58,950

7841
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,310
occupation there's is there a good word
for this of uh pl of planets like it's a

7842
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:06,320
for this of uh pl of planets like it's a
 

7843
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:08,709
for this of uh pl of planets like it's a
to terraform the planet

7844
02:03:08,709 --> 02:03:08,719
to terraform the planet
 

7845
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:10,550
to terraform the planet
you know to adjust the human body to the

7846
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:10,560
you know to adjust the human body to the
 

7847
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,390
you know to adjust the human body to the
planet oh oh oh there's not really a

7848
02:03:12,390 --> 02:03:12,400
planet oh oh oh there's not really a
 

7849
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:14,870
planet oh oh oh there's not really a
term for that yet i guess to

7850
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:14,880
term for that yet i guess to
 

7851
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:17,750
term for that yet i guess to
like adapt to uh what the new vacation

7852
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:17,760
like adapt to uh what the new vacation
 

7853
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:20,950
like adapt to uh what the new vacation
spot yeah i called it just the directed

7854
02:03:20,950 --> 02:03:20,960
spot yeah i called it just the directed
 

7855
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:22,950
spot yeah i called it just the directed
evolution in the book is that you you

7856
02:03:22,950 --> 02:03:22,960
evolution in the book is that you you
 

7857
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:24,950
evolution in the book is that you you
you guide the evolution towards what you

7858
02:03:24,950 --> 02:03:24,960
you guide the evolution towards what you
 

7859
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:26,550
you guide the evolution towards what you
want in this case sometimes you can

7860
02:03:26,550 --> 02:03:26,560
want in this case sometimes you can
 

7861
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:28,070
want in this case sometimes you can
engineer your cells to make exactly what

7862
02:03:28,070 --> 02:03:28,080
engineer your cells to make exactly what
 

7863
02:03:28,080 --> 02:03:29,830
engineer your cells to make exactly what
you want but other times you put people

7864
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:29,840
you want but other times you put people
 

7865
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:31,990
you want but other times you put people
on planets and and see how they change

7866
02:03:31,990 --> 02:03:32,000
on planets and and see how they change
 

7867
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:33,910
on planets and and see how they change
actually later in the book i imagine if

7868
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:33,920
actually later in the book i imagine if
 

7869
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:35,910
actually later in the book i imagine if
you have humans on multiple planets you

7870
02:03:35,910 --> 02:03:35,920
you have humans on multiple planets you
 

7871
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:37,430
you have humans on multiple planets you
could have this virtuous cycle whereas

7872
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:37,440
could have this virtuous cycle whereas
 

7873
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:39,350
could have this virtuous cycle whereas
people adapt and evolve here you'd

7874
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:39,360
people adapt and evolve here you'd
 

7875
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:40,790
people adapt and evolve here you'd
sequence their dna and see how they

7876
02:03:40,790 --> 02:03:40,800
sequence their dna and see how they
 

7877
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:42,709
sequence their dna and see how they
change and then send the information

7878
02:03:42,709 --> 02:03:42,719
change and then send the information
 

7879
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:44,070
change and then send the information
back to the other planet and then study

7880
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:44,080
back to the other planet and then study
 

7881
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:45,990
back to the other planet and then study
them with more resources so you'd be

7882
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,000
them with more resources so you'd be
 

7883
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,030
them with more resources so you'd be
able to then

7884
02:03:47,030 --> 02:03:47,040
able to then
 

7885
02:03:47,040 --> 02:03:49,109
able to then
have a continual exchange of what's

7886
02:03:49,109 --> 02:03:49,119
have a continual exchange of what's
 

7887
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:50,550
have a continual exchange of what's
evolving in which way and different

7888
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:50,560
evolving in which way and different
 

7889
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:52,310
evolving in which way and different
planets and then each planet would learn

7890
02:03:52,310 --> 02:03:52,320
planets and then each planet would learn
 

7891
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:53,990
planets and then each planet would learn
from the changes that they see at the

7892
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:54,000
from the changes that they see at the
 

7893
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:54,830
from the changes that they see at the
other

7894
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:54,840
other
 

7895
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:57,270
other
planet does the evolution happen at the

7896
02:03:57,270 --> 02:03:57,280
planet does the evolution happen at the
 

7897
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,030
planet does the evolution happen at the
scale of human or do we need the

7898
02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,040
scale of human or do we need the
 

7899
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,430
scale of human or do we need the
individual like or is it more efficient

7900
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
individual like or is it more efficient
 

7901
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:03,430
individual like or is it more efficient
to do like bacteria

7902
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:03,440
to do like bacteria
 

7903
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:05,510
to do like bacteria
bacteria cheaper and faster and easier

7904
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:05,520
bacteria cheaper and faster and easier
 

7905
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:07,189
bacteria cheaper and faster and easier
but we but we also have a lot of

7906
02:04:07,189 --> 02:04:07,199
but we but we also have a lot of
 

7907
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:09,109
but we but we also have a lot of
bacteria in us on us and all around us

7908
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:09,119
bacteria in us on us and all around us
 

7909
02:04:09,119 --> 02:04:10,470
bacteria in us on us and all around us
and even the bacteria on the space

7910
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:10,480
and even the bacteria on the space
 

7911
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,390
and even the bacteria on the space
station are continually evolving so do

7912
02:04:12,390 --> 02:04:12,400
station are continually evolving so do
 

7913
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:15,109
station are continually evolving so do
you study that by the way like non-human

7914
02:04:15,109 --> 02:04:15,119
you study that by the way like non-human
 

7915
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:19,109
you study that by the way like non-human
cells like what the microbiomes yep the

7916
02:04:19,109 --> 02:04:19,119
cells like what the microbiomes yep the
 

7917
02:04:19,119 --> 02:04:20,550
cells like what the microbiomes yep the
so we've seen it for the astronauts we

7918
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:20,560
so we've seen it for the astronauts we
 

7919
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,669
so we've seen it for the astronauts we
can actually see

7920
02:04:21,669 --> 02:04:21,679
can actually see
 

7921
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:22,709
can actually see
their

7922
02:04:22,709 --> 02:04:22,719
their
 

7923
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:24,149
their
their immune system respond to the

7924
02:04:24,149 --> 02:04:24,159
their immune system respond to the
 

7925
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:25,750
their immune system respond to the
microbiome of the space station so as

7926
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:25,760
microbiome of the space station so as
 

7927
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:27,750
microbiome of the space station so as
soon as you get into that aluminum tube

7928
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:27,760
soon as you get into that aluminum tube
 

7929
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:29,350
soon as you get into that aluminum tube
there's a whole ecosystem that's already

7930
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:29,360
there's a whole ecosystem that's already
 

7931
02:04:29,360 --> 02:04:31,189
there's a whole ecosystem that's already
up there and we can actually see we saw

7932
02:04:31,189 --> 02:04:31,199
up there and we can actually see we saw
 

7933
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:32,390
up there and we can actually see we saw
this with scott kelly we've seen these

7934
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:32,400
this with scott kelly we've seen these
 

7935
02:04:32,400 --> 02:04:34,229
this with scott kelly we've seen these
other astronauts you can see the t cells

7936
02:04:34,229 --> 02:04:34,239
other astronauts you can see the t cells
 

7937
02:04:34,239 --> 02:04:35,270
other astronauts you can see the t cells
in their body they actually are

7938
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:35,280
in their body they actually are
 

7939
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,109
in their body they actually are
responding to little peptides a little

7940
02:04:37,109 --> 02:04:37,119
responding to little peptides a little
 

7941
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:38,550
responding to little peptides a little
the the molecules of the bacteria

7942
02:04:38,550 --> 02:04:38,560
the the molecules of the bacteria
 

7943
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:40,709
the the molecules of the bacteria
they're the immune system is looking for

7944
02:04:40,709 --> 02:04:40,719
they're the immune system is looking for
 

7945
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:42,550
they're the immune system is looking for
specific bacteria and then once it's

7946
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:42,560
specific bacteria and then once it's
 

7947
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,310
specific bacteria and then once it's
these new ones it remembers it and you

7948
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:44,320
these new ones it remembers it and you
 

7949
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:45,990
these new ones it remembers it and you
can see the body looking for the

7950
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
can see the body looking for the
 

7951
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,510
can see the body looking for the
microbes that are only on the space

7952
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:47,520
microbes that are only on the space
 

7953
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,430
microbes that are only on the space
station that you don't see on earth and

7954
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:49,440
station that you don't see on earth and
 

7955
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:50,790
station that you don't see on earth and
then when scott came back he actually

7956
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:50,800
then when scott came back he actually
 

7957
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:52,629
then when scott came back he actually
had more of those microbes embedded in

7958
02:04:52,629 --> 02:04:52,639
had more of those microbes embedded in
 

7959
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:54,950
had more of those microbes embedded in
his skin and in his mouth and stool that

7960
02:04:54,950 --> 02:04:54,960
his skin and in his mouth and stool that
 

7961
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,390
his skin and in his mouth and stool that
weren't there before so he like picked

7962
02:04:56,390 --> 02:04:56,400
weren't there before so he like picked
 

7963
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:58,470
weren't there before so he like picked
up new hitchhikers in the space station

7964
02:04:58,470 --> 02:04:58,480
up new hitchhikers in the space station
 

7965
02:04:58,480 --> 02:04:59,669
up new hitchhikers in the space station
and brought some of them back down with

7966
02:04:59,669 --> 02:04:59,679
and brought some of them back down with
 

7967
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:01,430
and brought some of them back down with
them so there's like long-term

7968
02:05:01,430 --> 02:05:01,440
them so there's like long-term
 

7969
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,109
them so there's like long-term
ecosystems yeah

7970
02:05:03,109 --> 02:05:03,119
ecosystems yeah
 

7971
02:05:03,119 --> 02:05:04,550
ecosystems yeah
20 years they've been up for 20 years

7972
02:05:04,550 --> 02:05:04,560
20 years they've been up for 20 years
 

7973
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:05,669
20 years they've been up for 20 years
yes

7974
02:05:05,669 --> 02:05:05,679
yes
 

7975
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:07,750
yes
there's some like chuck norris

7976
02:05:07,750 --> 02:05:07,760
there's some like chuck norris
 

7977
02:05:07,760 --> 02:05:09,669
there's some like chuck norris
bacteria up there i'm sure

7978
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:09,679
bacteria up there i'm sure
 

7979
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:12,470
bacteria up there i'm sure
uh you um you're part of the extreme

7980
02:05:12,470 --> 02:05:12,480
uh you um you're part of the extreme
 

7981
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,870
uh you um you're part of the extreme
microbiome project

7982
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:14,880
microbiome project
 

7983
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,550
microbiome project
what does that involve and what kind of

7984
02:05:16,550 --> 02:05:16,560
what does that involve and what kind of
 

7985
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:19,430
what does that involve and what kind of
fun

7986
02:05:19,430 --> 02:05:19,440

 

7987
02:05:19,440 --> 02:05:20,950

fun organisms

7988
02:05:20,950 --> 02:05:20,960
fun organisms
 

7989
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,390
fun organisms
have you all learned about have you

7990
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:22,400
have you all learned about have you
 

7991
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,950
have you all learned about have you
gotten to explore we have a really fun

7992
02:05:24,950 --> 02:05:24,960
gotten to explore we have a really fun
 

7993
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:27,350
gotten to explore we have a really fun
project xmp the extreme microbiome which

7994
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:27,360
project xmp the extreme microbiome which
 

7995
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:29,350
project xmp the extreme microbiome which
is as it sounds like we look for really

7996
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:29,360
is as it sounds like we look for really
 

7997
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:30,950
is as it sounds like we look for really
odd places like

7998
02:05:30,950 --> 02:05:30,960
odd places like
 

7999
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:33,109
odd places like
heavy radiation environments high salt

8000
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:33,119
heavy radiation environments high salt
 

8001
02:05:33,119 --> 02:05:35,270
heavy radiation environments high salt
high or low temperature you know strange

8002
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:35,280
high or low temperature you know strange
 

8003
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:36,950
high or low temperature you know strange
area the space station for example lots

8004
02:05:36,950 --> 02:05:36,960
area the space station for example lots
 

8005
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:38,950
area the space station for example lots
of radiation and microgravity places

8006
02:05:38,950 --> 02:05:38,960
of radiation and microgravity places
 

8007
02:05:38,960 --> 02:05:41,109
of radiation and microgravity places
where organisms can evolve for

8008
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:41,119
where organisms can evolve for
 

8009
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:43,350
where organisms can evolve for
interesting adaptations and some of them

8010
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:43,360
interesting adaptations and some of them
 

8011
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,510
interesting adaptations and some of them
have been organisms we've seen like a

8012
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:45,520
have been organisms we've seen like a
 

8013
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:47,669
have been organisms we've seen like a
candy pink lake in australia called lake

8014
02:05:47,669 --> 02:05:47,679
candy pink lake in australia called lake
 

8015
02:05:47,679 --> 02:05:49,669
candy pink lake in australia called lake
hillier which would just publish a paper

8016
02:05:49,669 --> 02:05:49,679
hillier which would just publish a paper
 

8017
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:51,830
hillier which would just publish a paper
on this word why is it pink uh so it's

8018
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:51,840
on this word why is it pink uh so it's
 

8019
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,990
on this word why is it pink uh so it's
actually uh denalia salinas and these

8020
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:54,000
actually uh denalia salinas and these
 

8021
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:55,270
actually uh denalia salinas and these
one of these organisms there's a mixture

8022
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:55,280
one of these organisms there's a mixture
 

8023
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:57,589
one of these organisms there's a mixture
of bacteria and some algae that are

8024
02:05:57,589 --> 02:05:57,599
of bacteria and some algae that are
 

8025
02:05:57,599 --> 02:05:59,270
of bacteria and some algae that are
there that make it bright pink so they

8026
02:05:59,270 --> 02:05:59,280
there that make it bright pink so they
 

8027
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,870
there that make it bright pink so they
actually make carotenoids these like

8028
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:00,880
actually make carotenoids these like
 

8029
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:03,109
actually make carotenoids these like
really sort of orangey and kind of pink

8030
02:06:03,109 --> 02:06:03,119
really sort of orangey and kind of pink
 

8031
02:06:03,119 --> 02:06:04,470
really sort of orangey and kind of pink
molecules when you look at them in the

8032
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:04,480
molecules when you look at them in the
 

8033
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:06,310
molecules when you look at them in the
light so if you know if you get enough

8034
02:06:06,310 --> 02:06:06,320
light so if you know if you get enough
 

8035
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:08,229
light so if you know if you get enough
of the bacteria it becomes pink so and

8036
02:06:08,229 --> 02:06:08,239
of the bacteria it becomes pink so and
 

8037
02:06:08,239 --> 02:06:09,830
of the bacteria it becomes pink so and
it's not just pink it's like a bubblegum

8038
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:09,840
it's not just pink it's like a bubblegum
 

8039
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:12,629
it's not just pink it's like a bubblegum
pink the lake and so we uh that's just

8040
02:06:12,629 --> 02:06:12,639
pink the lake and so we uh that's just
 

8041
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:14,790
pink the lake and so we uh that's just
an odd it's a halophile being said it

8042
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:14,800
an odd it's a halophile being said it
 

8043
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:18,310
an odd it's a halophile being said it
grows in 30 salt and if you go below 10

8044
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:18,320
grows in 30 salt and if you go below 10
 

8045
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:20,069
grows in 30 salt and if you go below 10
15 percent salt it doesn't even grow it

8046
02:06:20,069 --> 02:06:20,079
15 percent salt it doesn't even grow it
 

8047
02:06:20,079 --> 02:06:21,430
15 percent salt it doesn't even grow it
actually kills it

8048
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:21,440
actually kills it
 

8049
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,510
actually kills it
well yeah there it is liqueur is it

8050
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:23,520
well yeah there it is liqueur is it
 

8051
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:25,669
well yeah there it is liqueur is it
toxic to humans or no it so when you

8052
02:06:25,669 --> 02:06:25,679
toxic to humans or no it so when you
 

8053
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:28,550
toxic to humans or no it so when you
walk in the pink lake actually it's so

8054
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:28,560
walk in the pink lake actually it's so
 

8055
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,629
walk in the pink lake actually it's so
hypertonic meaning it's so salty you can

8056
02:06:30,629 --> 02:06:30,639
hypertonic meaning it's so salty you can
 

8057
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:32,709
hypertonic meaning it's so salty you can
feel it lysing and killing your cells on

8058
02:06:32,709 --> 02:06:32,719
feel it lysing and killing your cells on
 

8059
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:33,830
feel it lysing and killing your cells on
your foot so it actually hurts the

8060
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:33,840
your foot so it actually hurts the
 

8061
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:35,750
your foot so it actually hurts the
walking because it's so salty

8062
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:35,760
walking because it's so salty
 

8063
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:38,470
walking because it's so salty
uh so yeah so but it won't kill it'll

8064
02:06:38,470 --> 02:06:38,480
uh so yeah so but it won't kill it'll
 

8065
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,149
uh so yeah so but it won't kill it'll
listen you have to suffer for art and

8066
02:06:40,149 --> 02:06:40,159
listen you have to suffer for art and
 

8067
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:42,470
listen you have to suffer for art and
that's great art requires something i

8068
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:42,480
that's great art requires something i
 

8069
02:06:42,480 --> 02:06:44,950
that's great art requires something i
mean so it is a beautiful lake uh you

8070
02:06:44,950 --> 02:06:44,960
mean so it is a beautiful lake uh you
 

8071
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:46,310
mean so it is a beautiful lake uh you
have to get permits to go sample there

8072
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,320
have to get permits to go sample there
 

8073
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:47,830
have to get permits to go sample there
but we actually just got an email last

8074
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:47,840
but we actually just got an email last
 

8075
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:49,589
but we actually just got an email last
week there's pilots who fly over this in

8076
02:06:49,589 --> 02:06:49,599
week there's pilots who fly over this in
 

8077
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:51,350
week there's pilots who fly over this in
australia because they love the color

8078
02:06:51,350 --> 02:06:51,360
australia because they love the color
 

8079
02:06:51,360 --> 02:06:52,870
australia because they love the color
yeah so he emailed us one of the pilots

8080
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:52,880
yeah so he emailed us one of the pilots
 

8081
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:54,390
yeah so he emailed us one of the pilots
and he said hey guys i saw you publish

8082
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:54,400
and he said hey guys i saw you publish
 

8083
02:06:54,400 --> 02:06:55,510
and he said hey guys i saw you publish
his paper

8084
02:06:55,510 --> 02:06:55,520
his paper
 

8085
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:56,870
his paper
it's not as pink as it used to be

8086
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:56,880
it's not as pink as it used to be
 

8087
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:58,069
it's not as pink as it used to be
because he loves flying over it it was

8088
02:06:58,069 --> 02:06:58,079
because he loves flying over it it was
 

8089
02:06:58,079 --> 02:06:59,189
because he loves flying over it it was
like a little bit less pink because i

8090
02:06:59,189 --> 02:06:59,199
like a little bit less pink because i
 

8091
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:00,870
like a little bit less pink because i
had a bunch of rain in the past few

8092
02:07:00,870 --> 02:07:00,880
had a bunch of rain in the past few
 

8093
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:02,149
had a bunch of rain in the past few
weeks so it was just a little bit

8094
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:02,159
weeks so it was just a little bit
 

8095
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:03,910
weeks so it was just a little bit
diluted so we reassured him it'll get

8096
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:03,920
diluted so we reassured him it'll get
 

8097
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:05,830
diluted so we reassured him it'll get
more pink as they grow again

8098
02:07:05,830 --> 02:07:05,840
more pink as they grow again
 

8099
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:07,990
more pink as they grow again
uh but basically yeah it's a beautiful

8100
02:07:07,990 --> 02:07:08,000
uh but basically yeah it's a beautiful
 

8101
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,470
uh but basically yeah it's a beautiful
pink lake and so that is gorgeous

8102
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:10,480
pink lake and so that is gorgeous
 

8103
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,830
pink lake and so that is gorgeous
it's almost like that it's like a dr

8104
02:07:11,830 --> 02:07:11,840
it's almost like that it's like a dr
 

8105
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:13,030
it's almost like that it's like a dr
seuss book or something it does it's

8106
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:13,040
seuss book or something it does it's
 

8107
02:07:13,040 --> 02:07:14,629
seuss book or something it does it's
like it doesn't even look hard to get to

8108
02:07:14,629 --> 02:07:14,639
like it doesn't even look hard to get to
 

8109
02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:16,709
like it doesn't even look hard to get to
yeah it's there's no road if you have to

8110
02:07:16,709 --> 02:07:16,719
yeah it's there's no road if you have to
 

8111
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:19,189
yeah it's there's no road if you have to
basically fly uh land nearby and then

8112
02:07:19,189 --> 02:07:19,199
basically fly uh land nearby and then
 

8113
02:07:19,199 --> 02:07:20,790
basically fly uh land nearby and then
paddle in but uh so it's not next to

8114
02:07:20,790 --> 02:07:20,800
paddle in but uh so it's not next to
 

8115
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:22,229
paddle in but uh so it's not next to
anything

8116
02:07:22,229 --> 02:07:22,239
anything
 

8117
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:23,589
anything
so it's hard to get to but once you get

8118
02:07:23,589 --> 02:07:23,599
so it's hard to get to but once you get
 

8119
02:07:23,599 --> 02:07:26,069
so it's hard to get to but once you get
there um it's beautiful if anyone knows

8120
02:07:26,069 --> 02:07:26,079
there um it's beautiful if anyone knows
 

8121
02:07:26,079 --> 02:07:27,510
there um it's beautiful if anyone knows
how to get there let me know i want to

8122
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:27,520
how to get there let me know i want to
 

8123
02:07:27,520 --> 02:07:29,589
how to get there let me know i want to
go there okay cool what are some other

8124
02:07:29,589 --> 02:07:29,599
go there okay cool what are some other
 

8125
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:31,589
go there okay cool what are some other
extreme organisms

8126
02:07:31,589 --> 02:07:31,599
extreme organisms
 

8127
02:07:31,599 --> 02:07:34,069
extreme organisms
that you study other ones uh there's

8128
02:07:34,069 --> 02:07:34,079
that you study other ones uh there's
 

8129
02:07:34,079 --> 02:07:35,430
that you study other ones uh there's
some organisms we studied in the space

8130
02:07:35,430 --> 02:07:35,440
some organisms we studied in the space
 

8131
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:37,990
some organisms we studied in the space
station called acinitobacter pitii which

8132
02:07:37,990 --> 02:07:38,000
station called acinitobacter pitii which
 

8133
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,109
station called acinitobacter pitii which
is a

8134
02:07:39,109 --> 02:07:39,119
is a
 

8135
02:07:39,119 --> 02:07:42,069
is a
often found in human skin but we found

8136
02:07:42,069 --> 02:07:42,079
often found in human skin but we found
 

8137
02:07:42,079 --> 02:07:43,510
often found in human skin but we found
hundreds of strains in the space jason

8138
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:43,520
hundreds of strains in the space jason
 

8139
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,830
hundreds of strains in the space jason
that we've brought down and curated and

8140
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:45,840
that we've brought down and curated and
 

8141
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:48,310
that we've brought down and curated and
then sequenced uh and this is with uh

8142
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:48,320
then sequenced uh and this is with uh
 

8143
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:49,830
then sequenced uh and this is with uh
katsuri venkatsuran who's at jet

8144
02:07:49,830 --> 02:07:49,840
katsuri venkatsuran who's at jet
 

8145
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:51,830
katsuri venkatsuran who's at jet
propulsion laboratory working with him

8146
02:07:51,830 --> 02:07:51,840
propulsion laboratory working with him
 

8147
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:53,350
propulsion laboratory working with him
and they have evolved so they're now

8148
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:53,360
and they have evolved so they're now
 

8149
02:07:53,360 --> 02:07:56,069
and they have evolved so they're now
they no longer look like any earth-based

8150
02:07:56,069 --> 02:07:56,079
they no longer look like any earth-based
 

8151
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:58,390
they no longer look like any earth-based
ascinitobacter they don't look like

8152
02:07:58,390 --> 02:07:58,400
ascinitobacter they don't look like
 

8153
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:00,310
ascinitobacter they don't look like
they've now basically a new species so

8154
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:00,320
they've now basically a new species so
 

8155
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:01,669
they've now basically a new species so
actually we uh

8156
02:08:01,669 --> 02:08:01,679
actually we uh
 

8157
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:03,350
actually we uh
there's there's a different species of

8158
02:08:03,350 --> 02:08:03,360
there's there's a different species of
 

8159
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:05,830
there's there's a different species of
bacteria and fungi that have now mutated

8160
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:05,840
bacteria and fungi that have now mutated
 

8161
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,669
bacteria and fungi that have now mutated
so much on the space station they're

8162
02:08:07,669 --> 02:08:07,679
so much on the space station they're
 

8163
02:08:07,679 --> 02:08:09,189
so much on the space station they're
literally a new species and so we've

8164
02:08:09,189 --> 02:08:09,199
literally a new species and so we've
 

8165
02:08:09,199 --> 02:08:10,629
literally a new species and so we've
found some of those that have just

8166
02:08:10,629 --> 02:08:10,639
found some of those that have just
 

8167
02:08:10,639 --> 02:08:12,550
found some of those that have just
they're they're evolving in splash life

8168
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:12,560
they're they're evolving in splash life
 

8169
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:13,830
they're they're evolving in splash life
is always evolving and we can see it

8170
02:08:13,830 --> 02:08:13,840
is always evolving and we can see it
 

8171
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:15,589
is always evolving and we can see it
also in the space it's an entirely new

8172
02:08:15,589 --> 02:08:15,599
also in the space it's an entirely new
 

8173
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:17,510
also in the space it's an entirely new
species born in the space yeah that's

8174
02:08:17,510 --> 02:08:17,520
species born in the space yeah that's
 

8175
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:19,510
species born in the space yeah that's
completely different so we we find one

8176
02:08:19,510 --> 02:08:19,520
completely different so we we find one
 

8177
02:08:19,520 --> 02:08:21,830
completely different so we we find one
species actually

8178
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:21,840
species actually
 

8179
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:24,790
species actually
that we named after a donor to cornell

8180
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:24,800
that we named after a donor to cornell
 

8181
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:26,229
that we named after a donor to cornell
someone who's donated funds to her

8182
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:26,239
someone who's donated funds to her
 

8183
02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:28,149
someone who's donated funds to her
research so he named a different species

8184
02:08:28,149 --> 02:08:28,159
research so he named a different species
 

8185
02:08:28,159 --> 02:08:30,390
research so he named a different species
of fungus after him uh naganeshia

8186
02:08:30,390 --> 02:08:30,400
of fungus after him uh naganeshia
 

8187

8193
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:37,189
thank you for him donating to cornell we
said we've named this fungus

8194
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:37,199
said we've named this fungus
 

8195
02:08:37,199 --> 02:08:38,550
said we've named this fungus
that we found on the space station for

8196
02:08:38,550 --> 02:08:38,560
that we found on the space station for
 

8197
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:41,510
that we found on the space station for
you was he uh grateful or did he stop

8198
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:41,520
you was he uh grateful or did he stop

02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:05,830
conditions um
in ice in heat is that something of

8220
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:05,840
in ice in heat is that something of
 

8221
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:07,510
in ice in heat is that something of
interest to you and the things that

8222
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
interest to you and the things that
 

8223
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:09,030
interest to you and the things that
survive

8224
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:09,040
survive
 

8225
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:11,350
survive
where most things can't yes

8226
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:11,360
where most things can't yes
 

8227
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:12,870
where most things can't yes
of keen interest i think that will be

8228
02:09:12,870 --> 02:09:12,880
of keen interest i think that will be
 

8229
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:15,109
of keen interest i think that will be
the road map for some of the potential

8230
02:09:15,109 --> 02:09:15,119
the road map for some of the potential
 

8231
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:16,629
the road map for some of the potential
adaptations what we could think of for

8232
02:09:16,629 --> 02:09:16,639
adaptations what we could think of for
 

8233
02:09:16,639 --> 02:09:18,390
adaptations what we could think of for
human cells or certainly for

8234
02:09:18,390 --> 02:09:18,400
human cells or certainly for
 

8235
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:20,229
human cells or certainly for
our human the microbiome like just all

8236
02:09:20,229 --> 02:09:20,239
our human the microbiome like just all
 

8237
02:09:20,239 --> 02:09:22,310
our human the microbiome like just all
the micro organisms in and on and around

8238
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:22,320
the micro organisms in and on and around
 

8239
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:22,950
the micro organisms in and on and around
us

8240
02:09:22,950 --> 02:09:22,960
us
 

8241
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:25,510
us
so we've seen you know even there's this

8242
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:25,520
so we've seen you know even there's this
 

8243
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:28,709
so we've seen you know even there's this
one crater it's called um the the lake

8244
02:09:28,709 --> 02:09:28,719
one crater it's called um the the lake
 

8245
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:30,790
one crater it's called um the the lake
of fire it's in turkmenistan where it's

8246
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:30,800
of fire it's in turkmenistan where it's
 

8247
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:32,950
of fire it's in turkmenistan where it's
been on fire because of oil that had

8248
02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:32,960
been on fire because of oil that had
 

8249
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,790
been on fire because of oil that had
been set on fire decades ago and it's

8250
02:09:34,790 --> 02:09:34,800
been set on fire decades ago and it's
 

8251
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,550
been set on fire decades ago and it's
still burning so we collected some

8252
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:36,560
still burning so we collected some
 

8253
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:38,550
still burning so we collected some
samples from there and those were some

8254
02:09:38,550 --> 02:09:38,560
samples from there and those were some
 

8255
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:40,550
samples from there and those were some
pseudomonas potatoes some species we

8256
02:09:40,550 --> 02:09:40,560
pseudomonas potatoes some species we
 

8257
02:09:40,560 --> 02:09:41,990
pseudomonas potatoes some species we
found there that can so there's stuff

8258
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,000
found there that can so there's stuff
 

8259
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,589
found there that can so there's stuff
alive there that seems to be surviving

8260
02:09:43,589 --> 02:09:43,599
alive there that seems to be surviving
 

8261
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:44,629
alive there that seems to be surviving
there

8262
02:09:44,629 --> 02:09:44,639
there
 

8263
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:46,550
there
by this large uh pit of fire oh yeah

8264
02:09:46,550 --> 02:09:46,560
by this large uh pit of fire oh yeah
 

8265
02:09:46,560 --> 02:09:48,629
by this large uh pit of fire oh yeah
there is the desert it's been just on

8266
02:09:48,629 --> 02:09:48,639
there is the desert it's been just on
 

8267
02:09:48,639 --> 02:09:51,510
there is the desert it's been just on
fire for decades apparently

8268
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:51,520
fire for decades apparently
 

8269
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:53,510
fire for decades apparently
so this is another place though it's

8270
02:09:53,510 --> 02:09:53,520
so this is another place though it's
 

8271
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,990
so this is another place though it's
just the lake of fire yeah yeah and it's

8272
02:09:55,990 --> 02:09:56,000
just the lake of fire yeah yeah and it's
 

8273
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,830
just the lake of fire yeah yeah and it's
uh they said soviet scientists had set

8274
02:09:57,830 --> 02:09:57,840
uh they said soviet scientists had set
 

8275
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,910
uh they said soviet scientists had set
up a drilling rig here for extraction of

8276
02:09:59,910 --> 02:09:59,920
up a drilling rig here for extraction of
 

8277
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:02,229
up a drilling rig here for extraction of
natural gas

8278
02:10:02,229 --> 02:10:02,239
natural gas
 

8279
02:10:02,239 --> 02:10:04,069
natural gas
of course it would be in this part of

8280
02:10:04,069 --> 02:10:04,079
of course it would be in this part of
 

8281
02:10:04,079 --> 02:10:05,430
of course it would be in this part of
the world that you would get something

8282
02:10:05,430 --> 02:10:05,440
the world that you would get something
 

8283
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:07,589
the world that you would get something
like this but the rig collapsed and

8284
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:07,599
like this but the rig collapsed and
 

8285
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:09,430
like this but the rig collapsed and
methane gas is being released from the

8286
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:09,440
methane gas is being released from the
 

8287
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,510
methane gas is being released from the
crater

8288
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:11,520
crater
 

8289
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:13,430
crater
yeah so for those just listening we're

8290
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:13,440
yeah so for those just listening we're
 

8291
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:14,629
yeah so for those just listening we're
looking at a

8292
02:10:14,629 --> 02:10:14,639
looking at a
 

8293
02:10:14,639 --> 02:10:15,830
looking at a
at a lake

8294
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:15,840
at a lake
 

8295
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:18,229
at a lake
full of fire and there's something alive

8296
02:10:18,229 --> 02:10:18,239
full of fire and there's something alive
 

8297
02:10:18,239 --> 02:10:19,669
full of fire and there's something alive
there

8298
02:10:19,669 --> 02:10:19,679
there
 

8299
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:21,990
there
allegedly and pseudometeos are known to

8300
02:10:21,990 --> 02:10:22,000
allegedly and pseudometeos are known to
 

8301
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,830
allegedly and pseudometeos are known to
be some of the most tough organs they

8302
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:23,840
be some of the most tough organs they
 

8303
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:26,149
be some of the most tough organs they
actually can clean toxic waste

8304
02:10:26,149 --> 02:10:26,159
actually can clean toxic waste
 

8305
02:10:26,159 --> 02:10:27,910
actually can clean toxic waste
from you know many years of superfund

8306
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:27,920
from you know many years of superfund
 

8307
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:30,149
from you know many years of superfund
sites where there's so much waste that's

8308
02:10:30,149 --> 02:10:30,159
sites where there's so much waste that's
 

8309
02:10:30,159 --> 02:10:31,589
sites where there's so much waste that's
been deposited you'll find them there as

8310
02:10:31,589 --> 02:10:31,599
been deposited you'll find them there as
 

8311
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:33,189
been deposited you'll find them there as
well actually there's one place in the

8312
02:10:33,189 --> 02:10:33,199
well actually there's one place in the
 

8313
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:34,790
well actually there's one place in the
gowanus canal we have something it's

8314
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:34,800
gowanus canal we have something it's
 

8315
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:37,350
gowanus canal we have something it's
called in new york city in brooklyn

8316
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:37,360
called in new york city in brooklyn
 

8317
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:39,589
called in new york city in brooklyn
and it is a complete toxic waste dump

8318
02:10:39,589 --> 02:10:39,599
and it is a complete toxic waste dump
 

8319
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:41,109
and it is a complete toxic waste dump
that was where a lot of waste in the

8320
02:10:41,109 --> 02:10:41,119
that was where a lot of waste in the
 

8321
02:10:41,119 --> 02:10:43,910
that was where a lot of waste in the
1700s was dumped and so the gateway to

8322
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:43,920
1700s was dumped and so the gateway to
 

8323
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:46,470
1700s was dumped and so the gateway to
hell um is what it's called but the the

8324
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:46,480
hell um is what it's called but the the
 

8325
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,760
hell um is what it's called but the the
the nickname

8326
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:47,770
the nickname
 

8327
02:10:47,770 --> 02:10:50,950
the nickname
[Laughter]

8328
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:50,960
[Laughter]
 

8329
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:53,270
[Laughter]
so the the gowanus canal is also a place

8330
02:10:53,270 --> 02:10:53,280
so the the gowanus canal is also a place
 

8331
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:55,669
so the the gowanus canal is also a place
that has been fun to sequence and see so

8332
02:10:55,669 --> 02:10:55,679
that has been fun to sequence and see so
 

8333
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:58,470
that has been fun to sequence and see so
the pseudomonas species that can survive

8334
02:10:58,470 --> 02:10:58,480
the pseudomonas species that can survive
 

8335
02:10:58,480 --> 02:10:59,830
the pseudomonas species that can survive
basically pulling toxins from the

8336
02:10:59,830 --> 02:10:59,840
basically pulling toxins from the
 

8337
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:01,030
basically pulling toxins from the
environment so

8338
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:01,040
environment so
 

8339
02:11:01,040 --> 02:11:03,270
environment so
it is if you create this toxic landscape

8340
02:11:03,270 --> 02:11:03,280
it is if you create this toxic landscape
 

8341
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:05,189
it is if you create this toxic landscape
and then evolution comes in and says

8342
02:11:05,189 --> 02:11:05,199
and then evolution comes in and says
 

8343
02:11:05,199 --> 02:11:06,870
and then evolution comes in and says
fine i'll make things that can survive

8344
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:06,880
fine i'll make things that can survive
 

8345
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,149
fine i'll make things that can survive
here and when you look at the

8346
02:11:08,149 --> 02:11:08,159
here and when you look at the
 

8347
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:10,229
here and when you look at the
biochemistry of those species what

8348
02:11:10,229 --> 02:11:10,239
biochemistry of those species what
 

8349
02:11:10,239 --> 02:11:12,229
biochemistry of those species what
they've created is their own salvation

8350
02:11:12,229 --> 02:11:12,239
they've created is their own salvation
 

8351
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:14,229
they've created is their own salvation
basically the selection has made them

8352
02:11:14,229 --> 02:11:14,239
basically the selection has made them
 

8353
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:15,830
basically the selection has made them
survivors and suddenly you can use that

8354
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
survivors and suddenly you can use that
 

8355
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:17,750
survivors and suddenly you can use that
to remediate other polluted sites for

8356
02:11:17,750 --> 02:11:17,760
to remediate other polluted sites for
 

8357
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:19,830
to remediate other polluted sites for
example so that explains twitter

8358
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:19,840
example so that explains twitter
 

8359
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:22,149
example so that explains twitter
perfectly the toxicity created

8360
02:11:22,149 --> 02:11:22,159
perfectly the toxicity created
 

8361
02:11:22,159 --> 02:11:23,669
perfectly the toxicity created

yes
what are some wild

8380
02:11:44,069 --> 02:11:44,079
what are some wild
 

8381
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:45,910
what are some wild
innovations that might happen in the

8382
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:45,920
innovations that might happen in the
 

8383
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:48,229
innovations that might happen in the
space of physics or biology by the way

8384
02:11:48,229 --> 02:11:48,239
space of physics or biology by the way
 

8385
02:11:48,239 --> 02:11:50,709
space of physics or biology by the way
where do you think is the most exciting

8386
02:11:50,709 --> 02:11:50,719
where do you think is the most exciting
 

8387
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:53,109
where do you think is the most exciting
breakthroughs for interstellar travel

8388
02:11:53,109 --> 02:11:53,119
breakthroughs for interstellar travel
 

8389
02:11:53,119 --> 02:11:55,109
breakthroughs for interstellar travel
that will happen in the next 500 years

8390
02:11:55,109 --> 02:11:55,119
that will happen in the next 500 years
 

8391
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:58,069
that will happen in the next 500 years
is it physics is it biology

8392
02:11:58,069 --> 02:11:58,079
is it physics is it biology
 

8393
02:11:58,079 --> 02:12:01,109
is it physics is it biology
is it computer science so information or

8394
02:12:01,109 --> 02:12:01,119
is it computer science so information or
 

8395
02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:04,550
is it computer science so information or
dna like some kind of

8396
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:04,560
dna like some kind of
 

8397
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:07,270
dna like some kind of
informational type of thing is it

8398
02:12:07,270 --> 02:12:07,280
informational type of thing is it
 

8399
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,430
informational type of thing is it
biological like physiological making the

8400
02:12:09,430 --> 02:12:09,440
biological like physiological making the
 

8401
02:12:09,440 --> 02:12:11,270
biological like physiological making the
body resilient

8402
02:12:11,270 --> 02:12:11,280
body resilient
 

8403
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:14,149
body resilient
um live longer

8404
02:12:14,149 --> 02:12:14,159
um live longer
 

8405
02:12:14,159 --> 02:12:15,830
um live longer
and resilient to the harsh conditions of

8406
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:15,840
and resilient to the harsh conditions of
 

8407
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:19,990
and resilient to the harsh conditions of
space or is it the actual vehicle of

8408
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,000
space or is it the actual vehicle of
 

8409
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,790
space or is it the actual vehicle of
transport which would be applied physics

8410
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:22,800
transport which would be applied physics
 

8411
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:24,229
transport which would be applied physics
as you can probably guess i'll say all

8412
02:12:24,229 --> 02:12:24,239
as you can probably guess i'll say all
 

8413
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:25,669
as you can probably guess i'll say all
the above the

8414
02:12:25,669 --> 02:12:25,679
the above the
 

8415
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:27,430
the above the
question

8416
02:12:27,430 --> 02:12:27,440
question
 

8417
02:12:27,440 --> 02:12:29,430
question
but but to break those down though i

8418
02:12:29,430 --> 02:12:29,440
but but to break those down though i
 

8419
02:12:29,440 --> 02:12:31,430
but but to break those down though i
think the ai i hope in the book later

8420
02:12:31,430 --> 02:12:31,440
think the ai i hope in the book later
 

8421
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,669
think the ai i hope in the book later
that we would have really good machine

8422
02:12:33,669 --> 02:12:33,679
that we would have really good machine
 

8423
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:36,470
that we would have really good machine
companions that the ai i really hope the

8424
02:12:36,470 --> 02:12:36,480
companions that the ai i really hope the
 

8425
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,709
companions that the ai i really hope the
ais that we build like realistically we

8426
02:12:38,709 --> 02:12:38,719
ais that we build like realistically we
 

8427
02:12:38,719 --> 02:12:40,550
ais that we build like realistically we
are the programmers are making them i

8428
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:40,560
are the programmers are making them i
 

8429
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,470
are the programmers are making them i
would feel the colossal failure if we

8430
02:12:42,470 --> 02:12:42,480
would feel the colossal failure if we
 

8431
02:12:42,480 --> 02:12:43,910
would feel the colossal failure if we
didn't make ai that was embedded with a

8432
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:43,920
didn't make ai that was embedded with a
 

8433
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:46,149
didn't make ai that was embedded with a
sense of duty and caretaking

8434
02:12:46,149 --> 02:12:46,159
sense of duty and caretaking
 

8435
02:12:46,159 --> 02:12:48,069
sense of duty and caretaking
and friendship and even even creativity

8436
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:48,079
and friendship and even even creativity
 

8437
02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:50,149
and friendship and even even creativity
like we have the opportunity we're i've

8438
02:12:50,149 --> 02:12:50,159
like we have the opportunity we're i've
 

8439
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:52,790
like we have the opportunity we're i've
coded algorithms myself like

8440
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:52,800
coded algorithms myself like
 

8441
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:54,550
coded algorithms myself like
we're building them so it would it's

8442
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:54,560
we're building them so it would it's
 

8443
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:56,149
we're building them so it would it's
incumbent upon us to actually make them

8444
02:12:56,149 --> 02:12:56,159
incumbent upon us to actually make them
 

8445
02:12:56,159 --> 02:12:58,149
incumbent upon us to actually make them
uh not you know i think frankly

8446
02:12:58,149 --> 02:12:58,159
uh not you know i think frankly
 

8447
02:12:58,159 --> 02:12:59,189
uh not you know i think frankly
so just be

8448
02:12:59,189 --> 02:12:59,199
so just be
 

8449
02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:01,270
so just be
uh technical

8450
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:01,280
uh technical
 

8451
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,510
uh technical
actually on that point uh just to linger

8452
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:03,520
actually on that point uh just to linger
 

8453
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:05,030
actually on that point uh just to linger
on the ai front

8454
02:13:05,030 --> 02:13:05,040
on the ai front
 

8455
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:07,430
on the ai front
can you still man the case that hal 9000

8456
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:07,440
can you still man the case that hal 9000
 

8457
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:09,189
can you still man the case that hal 9000
from space odyssey

8458
02:13:09,189 --> 02:13:09,199
from space odyssey
 

8459
02:13:09,199 --> 02:13:12,390
from space odyssey
was doing the right thing

8460
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:12,400

 

8461
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,470

so you know so for people who haven't

8462
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:14,480
so you know so for people who haven't
 

8463
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:18,069
so you know so for people who haven't
seen 2001 space odyssey held 9000 is

8464
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:18,079
seen 2001 space odyssey held 9000 is
 

8465
02:13:18,079 --> 02:13:19,589
seen 2001 space odyssey held 9000 is
very kind of

8466
02:13:19,589 --> 02:13:19,599
very kind of
 

8467
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:22,069
very kind of
um focused on the mission cares a lot

8468
02:13:22,069 --> 02:13:22,079
um focused on the mission cares a lot
 

8469
02:13:22,079 --> 02:13:25,109
um focused on the mission cares a lot
about the mission and uh kind of

8470
02:13:25,109 --> 02:13:25,119
about the mission and uh kind of
 

8471
02:13:25,119 --> 02:13:27,030
about the mission and uh kind of
wants to hurt the astronauts that try to

8472
02:13:27,030 --> 02:13:27,040
wants to hurt the astronauts that try to
 

8473
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:28,870
wants to hurt the astronauts that try to
get in the way of the mission

8474
02:13:28,870 --> 02:13:28,880
get in the way of the mission
 

8475
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:31,109
get in the way of the mission
i think he was doing who's program to do

8476
02:13:31,109 --> 02:13:31,119
i think he was doing who's program to do
 

8477
02:13:31,119 --> 02:13:33,189
i think he was doing who's program to do
which was just to follow the mission

8478
02:13:33,189 --> 02:13:33,199
which was just to follow the mission
 

8479
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:35,510
which was just to follow the mission
but didn't have a sense of

8480
02:13:35,510 --> 02:13:35,520
but didn't have a sense of
 

8481
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:37,669
but didn't have a sense of
you know think a broader

8482
02:13:37,669 --> 02:13:37,679
you know think a broader
 

8483
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:39,589
you know think a broader
duty you could i mean

8484
02:13:39,589 --> 02:13:39,599
duty you could i mean
 

8485
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:41,990
duty you could i mean
what's the broader duty exactly uh

8486
02:13:41,990 --> 02:13:42,000
what's the broader duty exactly uh
 

8487
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,550
what's the broader duty exactly uh
maintaining the the well-being of

8488
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:44,560
maintaining the the well-being of
 

8489
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,550
maintaining the the well-being of
astronauts yeah or giving them another

8490
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:46,560
astronauts yeah or giving them another
 

8491
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,990
astronauts yeah or giving them another
option i think you viewed them as like

8492
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,000
option i think you viewed them as like
 

8493
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,109
option i think you viewed them as like
completely

8494
02:13:49,109 --> 02:13:49,119
completely
 

8495
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:51,109
completely
expendable rather than say not

8496
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:51,119
expendable rather than say not
 

8497
02:13:51,119 --> 02:13:52,229
expendable rather than say not
completely

8498
02:13:52,229 --> 02:13:52,239
completely
 

8499
02:13:52,239 --> 02:13:54,790
completely
it's a trade-off well

8500
02:13:54,790 --> 02:13:54,800
it's a trade-off well
 

8501
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,870
it's a trade-off well
so like a doctor has to make decisions

8502
02:13:56,870 --> 02:13:56,880
so like a doctor has to make decisions
 

8503
02:13:56,880 --> 02:13:59,910
so like a doctor has to make decisions
like this too you're restricted on the

8504
02:13:59,910 --> 02:13:59,920
like this too you're restricted on the
 

8505
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:01,350
like this too you're restricted on the
resources you have to make life and

8506
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:01,360
resources you have to make life and
 

8507
02:14:01,360 --> 02:14:03,910
resources you have to make life and
death decisions yeah so

8508
02:14:03,910 --> 02:14:03,920
death decisions yeah so
 

8509
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:06,870
death decisions yeah so
maybe hal 9000 had a long-term vision of

8510
02:14:06,870 --> 02:14:06,880
maybe hal 9000 had a long-term vision of
 

8511
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:09,189
maybe hal 9000 had a long-term vision of
what is good for the civilization back

8512
02:14:09,189 --> 02:14:09,199
what is good for the civilization back
 

8513
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:12,149
what is good for the civilization back
at home maybe a a deontogenic vision of

8514
02:14:12,149 --> 02:14:12,159
at home maybe a a deontogenic vision of
 

8515
02:14:12,159 --> 02:14:14,149
at home maybe a a deontogenic vision of
what was the best duty uh for for the

8516
02:14:14,149 --> 02:14:14,159
what was the best duty uh for for the
 

8517
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:16,310
what was the best duty uh for for the
genetics you could say

8518
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:16,320
genetics you could say
 

8519
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,629
genetics you could say
it's de-antigenic it's a word i made up

8520
02:14:18,629 --> 02:14:18,639
it's de-antigenic it's a word i made up
 

8521
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:19,750
it's de-antigenic it's a word i made up
in the book it's like what is your

8522
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:19,760
in the book it's like what is your
 

8523
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,189
in the book it's like what is your
genetic duties

8524
02:14:21,189 --> 02:14:21,199
genetic duties
 

8525
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:23,350
genetic duties
when you think of my your dna right what

8526
02:14:23,350 --> 02:14:23,360
when you think of my your dna right what
 

8527
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:24,550
when you think of my your dna right what
are you supposed to do with it which is

8528
02:14:24,550 --> 02:14:24,560
are you supposed to do with it which is
 

8529
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:27,910
are you supposed to do with it which is
kind of the value of life but if hal was

8530
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:27,920
kind of the value of life but if hal was
 

8531
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:30,069
kind of the value of life but if hal was
a silicon-based version of genetics

8532
02:14:30,069 --> 02:14:30,079
a silicon-based version of genetics
 

8533
02:14:30,079 --> 02:14:31,830
a silicon-based version of genetics
which is just his own

8534
02:14:31,830 --> 02:14:31,840
which is just his own
 

8535
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:34,390
which is just his own
maintenance of himself and self-survival

8536
02:14:34,390 --> 02:14:34,400
maintenance of himself and self-survival
 

8537
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:35,430
maintenance of himself and self-survival
you could argue he's doing the right

8538
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:35,440
you could argue he's doing the right
 

8539
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:37,990
you could argue he's doing the right
thing for himself but i think a human in

8540
02:14:37,990 --> 02:14:38,000
thing for himself but i think a human in
 

8541
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,430
thing for himself but i think a human in
that circumstance might have tried to

8542
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:39,440
that circumstance might have tried to
 

8543
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:41,189
that circumstance might have tried to
find a way to

8544
02:14:41,189 --> 02:14:41,199
find a way to
 

8545
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:42,629
find a way to
uh even if the astronauts don't agree

8546
02:14:42,629 --> 02:14:42,639
uh even if the astronauts don't agree
 

8547
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:44,229
uh even if the astronauts don't agree
with the mission to figure out something

8548
02:14:44,229 --> 02:14:44,239
with the mission to figure out something
 

8549
02:14:44,239 --> 02:14:46,069
with the mission to figure out something
to get them on a different spacecraft to

8550
02:14:46,069 --> 02:14:46,079
to get them on a different spacecraft to
 

8551
02:14:46,079 --> 02:14:47,910
to get them on a different spacecraft to
go away or something versus just say

8552
02:14:47,910 --> 02:14:47,920
go away or something versus just say
 

8553
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:49,030
go away or something versus just say
well

8554
02:14:49,030 --> 02:14:49,040
well
 

8555
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:50,069
well
you're in the way of the mission i'll

8556
02:14:50,069 --> 02:14:50,079
you're in the way of the mission i'll
 

8557
02:14:50,079 --> 02:14:52,470
you're in the way of the mission i'll
just you have to die is i think

8558
02:14:52,470 --> 02:14:52,480
just you have to die is i think
 

8559
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:53,830
just you have to die is i think
but accommodation candidates you've made

8560
02:14:53,830 --> 02:14:53,840
but accommodation candidates you've made
 

8561
02:14:53,840 --> 02:14:54,870
but accommodation candidates you've made
to your point with doctors like

8562
02:14:54,870 --> 02:14:54,880
to your point with doctors like
 

8563
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:56,069
to your point with doctors like
sometimes you'd like to save three

8564
02:14:56,069 --> 02:14:56,079
sometimes you'd like to save three
 

8565
02:14:56,079 --> 02:14:57,910
sometimes you'd like to save three
people but you can only save two yeah

8566
02:14:57,910 --> 02:14:57,920
people but you can only save two yeah
 

8567
02:14:57,920 --> 02:14:59,270
people but you can only save two yeah
and you have to at some point pick but i

8568
02:14:59,270 --> 02:14:59,280
and you have to at some point pick but i
 

8569
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,950
and you have to at some point pick but i
think uh in that sense it's a false

8570
02:15:00,950 --> 02:15:00,960
think uh in that sense it's a false
 

8571
02:15:00,960 --> 02:15:02,870
think uh in that sense it's a false
dichotomy i think hal

8572
02:15:02,870 --> 02:15:02,880
dichotomy i think hal
 

8573
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:04,950
dichotomy i think hal
didn't wasn't program two and didn't try

8574
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:04,960
didn't wasn't program two and didn't try
 

8575
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,109
didn't wasn't program two and didn't try
to find a third solution

8576
02:15:07,109 --> 02:15:07,119
to find a third solution
 

8577
02:15:07,119 --> 02:15:09,910
to find a third solution
perhaps the sex student russell proposes

8578
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:09,920
perhaps the sex student russell proposes
 

8579
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:11,350
perhaps the sex student russell proposes
this idea that

8580
02:15:11,350 --> 02:15:11,360
this idea that
 

8581
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:14,149
this idea that
ai systems should have self-doubt they

8582
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:14,159
ai systems should have self-doubt they
 

8583
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:15,589
ai systems should have self-doubt they
should be always uncertain in their

8584
02:15:15,589 --> 02:15:15,599
should be always uncertain in their
 

8585
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:18,470
should be always uncertain in their
final decision and that would help hal

8586
02:15:18,470 --> 02:15:18,480
final decision and that would help hal
 

8587
02:15:18,480 --> 02:15:20,870
final decision and that would help hal
sort of get out of the local

8588
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:20,880
sort of get out of the local
 

8589
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,790
sort of get out of the local
local optimum of this this is the

8590
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:22,800
local optimum of this this is the
 

8591
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,510
local optimum of this this is the
mission like always be a little bit like

8592
02:15:25,510 --> 02:15:25,520
mission like always be a little bit like
 

8593
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,189
mission like always be a little bit like
i'm not sure if it's the right thing and

8594
02:15:27,189 --> 02:15:27,199
i'm not sure if it's the right thing and
 

8595
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:29,030
i'm not sure if it's the right thing and
then you're forced to kind of contend

8596
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,040
then you're forced to kind of contend
 

8597
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:31,350
then you're forced to kind of contend
with other humans with other entities

8598
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:31,360
with other humans with other entities
 

8599
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:33,350
with other humans with other entities
and what is the right decision

8600
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,360
and what is the right decision
 

8601
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:36,390
and what is the right decision
um so like the the worst stuff the worst

8602
02:15:36,390 --> 02:15:36,400
um so like the the worst stuff the worst
 

8603
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:38,229
um so like the the worst stuff the worst
thing about decisions from that

8604
02:15:38,229 --> 02:15:38,239
thing about decisions from that
 

8605
02:15:38,239 --> 02:15:40,069
thing about decisions from that
perspective

8606
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
perspective
 

8607
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:43,830
perspective
is uh if you're extremely confident and

8608
02:15:43,830 --> 02:15:43,840
is uh if you're extremely confident and
 

8609
02:15:43,840 --> 02:15:46,709
is uh if you're extremely confident and
you're stubborn and immovable

8610
02:15:46,709 --> 02:15:46,719
you're stubborn and immovable
 

8611
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:48,790
you're stubborn and immovable
right and then but as programming doubt

8612
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:48,800
right and then but as programming doubt
 

8613
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:50,790
right and then but as programming doubt
is that sounds complicated that sounds

8614
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:50,800
is that sounds complicated that sounds
 

8615
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:53,430
is that sounds complicated that sounds
like go wrong yes

8616
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:53,440
like go wrong yes
 

8617
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:54,470
like go wrong yes
you can go wrong either way if you're

8618
02:15:54,470 --> 02:15:54,480
you can go wrong either way if you're
 

8619
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:56,149
you can go wrong either way if you're
too confident you won't see the other

8620
02:15:56,149 --> 02:15:56,159
too confident you won't see the other
 

8621
02:15:56,159 --> 02:15:57,350
too confident you won't see the other
options if you have too much doubt you

8622
02:15:57,350 --> 02:15:57,360
options if you have too much doubt you
 

8623
02:15:57,360 --> 02:15:58,950
options if you have too much doubt you
won't move you'll be paralyzed by the

8624
02:15:58,950 --> 02:15:58,960
won't move you'll be paralyzed by the
 

8625
02:15:58,960 --> 02:16:01,030
won't move you'll be paralyzed by the
options so you need some middle ground

8626
02:16:01,030 --> 02:16:01,040
options so you need some middle ground
 

8627
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,390
options so you need some middle ground
which i think is what most people

8628
02:16:02,390 --> 02:16:02,400
which i think is what most people
 

8629
02:16:02,400 --> 02:16:05,430
which i think is what most people
experience every day is we all love the

8630
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:05,440
experience every day is we all love the
 

8631
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:07,910
experience every day is we all love the
concept of being a steadfast

8632
02:16:07,910 --> 02:16:07,920
concept of being a steadfast
 

8633
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,910
concept of being a steadfast
resolute leader making big decisions

8634
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:09,920
resolute leader making big decisions
 

8635
02:16:09,920 --> 02:16:12,950
resolute leader making big decisions
quickly and without question

8636
02:16:12,950 --> 02:16:12,960
quickly and without question
 

8637
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:15,189
quickly and without question
but at the same time we know people can

8638
02:16:15,189 --> 02:16:15,199
but at the same time we know people can
 

8639
02:16:15,199 --> 02:16:16,550
but at the same time we know people can
be blinded to things they're missing if

8640
02:16:16,550 --> 02:16:16,560
be blinded to things they're missing if
 

8641
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:18,390
be blinded to things they're missing if
they're if they're two headstrong so

8642
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:18,400
they're if they're two headstrong so
 

8643
02:16:18,400 --> 02:16:20,709
they're if they're two headstrong so
so how would you improve hell 9000

8644
02:16:20,709 --> 02:16:20,719
so how would you improve hell 9000
 

8645
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:22,069
so how would you improve hell 9000
i think i i would

8646
02:16:22,069 --> 02:16:22,079
i think i i would
 

8647
02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:25,189
i think i i would
include other because hal is one program

8648
02:16:25,189 --> 02:16:25,199
include other because hal is one program
 

8649
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:26,790
include other because hal is one program
much like we do for humans you get

8650
02:16:26,790 --> 02:16:26,800
much like we do for humans you get
 

8651
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,790
much like we do for humans you get
feedback from other humans before you

8652
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:28,800
feedback from other humans before you
 

8653
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:30,310
feedback from other humans before you
make a decision that affects all of them

8654
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:30,320
make a decision that affects all of them
 

8655
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:31,990
make a decision that affects all of them
so i think hal could have gotten

8656
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:32,000
so i think hal could have gotten
 

8657
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,830
so i think hal could have gotten
feedback from other ai systems that said

8658
02:16:33,830 --> 02:16:33,840
feedback from other ai systems that said
 

8659
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,509
feedback from other ai systems that said
well is this are there other options

8660
02:16:35,509 --> 02:16:35,519
well is this are there other options
 

8661
02:16:35,519 --> 02:16:37,190
well is this are there other options
here and done it probably very quickly

8662
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:37,200
here and done it probably very quickly
 

8663
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,790
here and done it probably very quickly
are you even you know embed a

8664
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:38,800
are you even you know embed a
 

8665
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:40,230
are you even you know embed a
programming system where the ai has a

8666
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:40,240
programming system where the ai has a
 

8667
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:41,750
programming system where the ai has a
primary function but at times of

8668
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:41,760
primary function but at times of
 

8669
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:43,910
primary function but at times of
uncertainty queries a series of other

8670
02:16:43,910 --> 02:16:43,920
uncertainty queries a series of other
 

8671
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:46,150
uncertainty queries a series of other
programmed ai's to ask for a consensus

8672
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:46,160
programmed ai's to ask for a consensus
 

8673
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:48,389
programmed ai's to ask for a consensus
almost i'm like a democracy of the ai

8674
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:48,399
almost i'm like a democracy of the ai
 

8675
02:16:48,399 --> 02:16:49,750
almost i'm like a democracy of the ai
but since it's all programmed you can

8676
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:49,760
but since it's all programmed you can
 

8677
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:50,870
but since it's all programmed you can
bring it all together and say there's a

8678
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:50,880
bring it all together and say there's a
 

8679
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,709
bring it all together and say there's a
primary but it only activates the

8680
02:16:52,709 --> 02:16:52,719
primary but it only activates the
 

8681
02:16:52,719 --> 02:16:54,549
primary but it only activates the
parliament if you will for a decision

8682
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:54,559
parliament if you will for a decision
 

8683
02:16:54,559 --> 02:16:55,669
parliament if you will for a decision
when needed

8684
02:16:55,669 --> 02:16:55,679
when needed
 

8685
02:16:55,679 --> 02:16:56,709
when needed
i don't know how you program

8686
02:16:56,709 --> 02:16:56,719
i don't know how you program
 

8687
02:16:56,719 --> 02:16:58,389
i don't know how you program
dramatically different ais all in one

8688
02:16:58,389 --> 02:16:58,399
dramatically different ais all in one
 

8689
02:16:58,399 --> 02:17:00,790
dramatically different ais all in one
system that are different enough but

8690
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:00,800
system that are different enough but
 

8691
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,469
system that are different enough but
yeah conceptually it's possible of

8692
02:17:02,469 --> 02:17:02,479
yeah conceptually it's possible of
 

8693
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:04,469
yeah conceptually it's possible of
course that can lead to you know log jam

8694
02:17:04,469 --> 02:17:04,479

being now you think it's just a robot we
 

8743
02:17:52,719 --> 02:17:54,870
being now you think it's just a robot we
keep saying like it's just programmed

8744
02:17:54,870 --> 02:17:54,880
keep saying like it's just programmed
 

8745
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:56,150

life and death through conversation i
 

8807
02:18:57,439 --> 02:18:59,509

mean to me that's actually what makes a
 

8809
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:02,549

02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:47,120
the humanity in yourself yeah at the
 

8855
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:49,030
the humanity in yourself yeah at the
same time which is which is i mean

8856
02:19:49,030 --> 02:19:49,040
same time which is which is i mean
 

8857
02:19:49,040 --> 02:19:50,630
same time which is which is i mean
that's why they talked about kids have

8858
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:50,640
that's why they talked about kids have
 

8859
02:19:50,640 --> 02:19:52,550
that's why they talked about kids have
to be polite to alexa

8860
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:52,560
to be polite to alexa
 

8861
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:54,710
to be polite to alexa
um because they find if they're you know

8862
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:54,720
um because they find if they're you know
 

8863
02:19:54,720 --> 02:19:57,910
um because they find if they're you know
if people are if kids are rude to ai

8864
02:19:57,910 --> 02:19:57,920
if people are if kids are rude to ai
 

8865
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:00,630
if people are if kids are rude to ai
systems they actually that

8866
02:20:00,630 --> 02:20:00,640
systems they actually that
 

8867
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:02,710
systems they actually that
it's a bad sign right it's it's a bad

8868
02:20:02,710 --> 02:20:02,720
it's a bad sign right it's it's a bad
 

8869
02:20:02,720 --> 02:20:04,389
it's a bad sign right it's it's a bad
sign and it develops the wrong thing in

8870
02:20:04,389 --> 02:20:04,399
sign and it develops the wrong thing in
 

8871
02:20:04,399 --> 02:20:06,950
sign and it develops the wrong thing in
terms of how they treat other uh human

8872
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:06,960
terms of how they treat other uh human
 

8873
02:20:06,960 --> 02:20:09,030
terms of how they treat other uh human
beings so that's ai

8874
02:20:09,030 --> 02:20:09,040
beings so that's ai
 

8875
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:10,630
beings so that's ai
so what about physics

8876
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:10,640
so what about physics
 

8877
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:13,190
so what about physics
can we do in terms of can we travel

8878
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:13,200
can we do in terms of can we travel
 

8879
02:20:13,200 --> 02:20:14,790
can we do in terms of can we travel
close to the speed of light can we

8880
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:14,800
close to the speed of light can we
 

8881
02:20:14,800 --> 02:20:16,870
close to the speed of light can we
travel faster than the speed of light we

8882
02:20:16,870 --> 02:20:16,880
travel faster than the speed of light we
 

8883
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:19,110
travel faster than the speed of light we
can i i would love to fold space we know

8884
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:19,120
can i i would love to fold space we know
 

8885
02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:21,349
can i i would love to fold space we know
wormholes are technically possible

8886
02:20:21,349 --> 02:20:21,359
wormholes are technically possible
 

8887
02:20:21,359 --> 02:20:22,870
wormholes are technically possible
but uh we have no way to do it i'd love

8888
02:20:22,870 --> 02:20:22,880
but uh we have no way to do it i'd love
 

8889
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:25,190
but uh we have no way to do it i'd love
to see advanced in wormhole technology

8890
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:25,200
to see advanced in wormhole technology
 

8891
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,590
to see advanced in wormhole technology
antimatter drives antimatter is

8892
02:20:27,590 --> 02:20:27,600
antimatter drives antimatter is
 

8893
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:29,670
antimatter drives antimatter is
notoriously uh missing for most of the

8894
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:29,680
notoriously uh missing for most of the
 

8895
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:32,389
notoriously uh missing for most of the
universe so what is antimatter drive

8896
02:20:32,389 --> 02:20:32,399
universe so what is antimatter drive
 

8897
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:33,750
universe so what is antimatter drive
antimatter would be where you used

8898
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:33,760
antimatter would be where you used
 

8899
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:36,150
antimatter would be where you used
purified bits of antimatter basically it

8900
02:20:36,150 --> 02:20:36,160
purified bits of antimatter basically it
 

8901
02:20:36,160 --> 02:20:38,469
purified bits of antimatter basically it
was the opposite of matter so if you can

8902
02:20:38,469 --> 02:20:38,479
was the opposite of matter so if you can
 

8903
02:20:38,479 --> 02:20:40,230
was the opposite of matter so if you can
have an anti-electron

8904
02:20:40,230 --> 02:20:40,240
have an anti-electron
 

8905
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:42,630
have an anti-electron
to the electron you could have even a

8906
02:20:42,630 --> 02:20:42,640
to the electron you could have even a
 

8907
02:20:42,640 --> 02:20:44,550
to the electron you could have even a
complete atoms that would be anti-atoms

8908
02:20:44,550 --> 02:20:44,560
complete atoms that would be anti-atoms
 

8909
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:45,990
complete atoms that would be anti-atoms
and when you put them together they

8910
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:46,000
and when you put them together they
 

8911
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,230
and when you put them together they
would be pure energy released in theory

8912
02:20:48,230 --> 02:20:48,240
would be pure energy released in theory
 

8913
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:50,389
would be pure energy released in theory
and that could drive the most powerful

8914
02:20:50,389 --> 02:20:50,399
and that could drive the most powerful
 

8915
02:20:50,399 --> 02:20:52,870
and that could drive the most powerful
possible engine for space travel

8916
02:20:52,870 --> 02:20:52,880
possible engine for space travel
 

8917
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:55,270
possible engine for space travel
but uh we you know that's the only place

8918
02:20:55,270 --> 02:20:55,280
but uh we you know that's the only place
 

8919
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:57,270
but uh we you know that's the only place
you can make antimatter is in large

8920
02:20:57,270 --> 02:20:57,280
you can make antimatter is in large
 

8921
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:58,710
you can make antimatter is in large
particle accelerators and only very

8922
02:20:58,710 --> 02:20:58,720
particle accelerators and only very
 

8923
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:00,870
particle accelerators and only very
briefly so that is hard but if that

8924
02:21:00,870 --> 02:21:00,880
briefly so that is hard but if that
 

8925
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:02,710
briefly so that is hard but if that
could work that would be extraordinary

8926
02:21:02,710 --> 02:21:02,720
could work that would be extraordinary
 

8927
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:03,830
could work that would be extraordinary
fusion drives would be great just

8928
02:21:03,830 --> 02:21:03,840
fusion drives would be great just
 

8929
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,230
fusion drives would be great just
getting nuclear fusion well controlled

8930
02:21:06,230 --> 02:21:06,240
getting nuclear fusion well controlled
 

8931
02:21:06,240 --> 02:21:07,190
getting nuclear fusion well controlled
and that would actually give you a

8932
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:07,200
and that would actually give you a
 

8933
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:08,870
and that would actually give you a
pretty good propulsion so i think that's

8934
02:21:08,870 --> 02:21:08,880
pretty good propulsion so i think that's
 

8935
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:09,990
pretty good propulsion so i think that's
the most likely thing we'll see is

8936
02:21:09,990 --> 02:21:10,000
the most likely thing we'll see is
 

8937
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,510
the most likely thing we'll see is
fusion drives fusion technology is

8938
02:21:11,510 --> 02:21:11,520
fusion drives fusion technology is
 

8939
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:13,110
fusion drives fusion technology is
getting better and better every year or

8940
02:21:13,110 --> 02:21:13,120
getting better and better every year or
 

8941
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:14,870
getting better and better every year or
it's that old saying fusion is always 10

8942
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:14,880
it's that old saying fusion is always 10
 

8943
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,550
it's that old saying fusion is always 10
years away every year it's always 10

8944
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:16,560
years away every year it's always 10
 

8945
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:18,710
years away every year it's always 10
years away but it's getting better and i

8946
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:18,720
years away but it's getting better and i
 

8947
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:21,190
years away but it's getting better and i
think and saying is something that is a

8948
02:21:21,190 --> 02:21:21,200
think and saying is something that is a
 

8949
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:23,910
think and saying is something that is a
century old or less than a century old

8950
02:21:23,910 --> 02:21:23,920
century old or less than a century old
 

8951
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:25,030
century old or less than a century old
over

8952
02:21:25,030 --> 02:21:25,040
over
 

8953
02:21:25,040 --> 02:21:28,389
over
multiple centuries that saying might

8954
02:21:28,389 --> 02:21:28,399
multiple centuries that saying might
 

8955
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:30,389
multiple centuries that saying might
might actually because the the fusion

8956
02:21:30,389 --> 02:21:30,399
might actually because the the fusion
 

8957
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:31,830
might actually because the the fusion
might actually become a reality for

8958
02:21:31,830 --> 02:21:31,840
might actually become a reality for
 

8959
02:21:31,840 --> 02:21:33,670
might actually become a reality for
propulsion so that would be i think very

8960
02:21:33,670 --> 02:21:33,680
propulsion so that would be i think very
 

8961
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:35,429
propulsion so that would be i think very
likely to see in the next few centuries

8962
02:21:35,429 --> 02:21:35,439
likely to see in the next few centuries
 

8963
02:21:35,439 --> 02:21:37,110
likely to see in the next few centuries
and then and then biology was the other

8964
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:37,120
and then and then biology was the other
 

8965
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:38,710
and then and then biology was the other
part or anything else physics i mean

8966
02:21:38,710 --> 02:21:38,720
part or anything else physics i mean
 

8967
02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:41,110
part or anything else physics i mean
physics you can imagine ways that have

8968
02:21:41,110 --> 02:21:41,120
physics you can imagine ways that have
 

8969
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:43,270
physics you can imagine ways that have
electromagnetic shielding so it could be

8970
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:43,280
electromagnetic shielding so it could be
 

8971
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,630
electromagnetic shielding so it could be
you could deflect all the cosmic rays

8972
02:21:44,630 --> 02:21:44,640
you could deflect all the cosmic rays
 

8973
02:21:44,640 --> 02:21:45,830
you could deflect all the cosmic rays
that are coming at your spacecraft with

8974
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:45,840
that are coming at your spacecraft with
 

8975
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,590
that are coming at your spacecraft with
a large almost like force field quite

8976
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:47,600
a large almost like force field quite
 

8977
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:48,550
a large almost like force field quite
frankly

8978
02:21:48,550 --> 02:21:48,560
frankly
 

8979
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,150
frankly
uh that would take some development to

8980
02:21:50,150 --> 02:21:50,160
uh that would take some development to
 

8981
02:21:50,160 --> 02:21:52,550
uh that would take some development to
do but that would be good to see

8982
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:52,560
do but that would be good to see
 

8983
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:55,190
do but that would be good to see
and uploading

8984
02:21:55,190 --> 02:21:55,200
and uploading
 

8985
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:56,790
and uploading
human

8986
02:21:56,790 --> 02:21:56,800
human
 

8987
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:59,510
human
memories and consciousness into digital

8988
02:21:59,510 --> 02:21:59,520
memories and consciousness into digital
 

8989
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:00,950
memories and consciousness into digital
form yeah this kind of blends the

8990
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:00,960
form yeah this kind of blends the
 

8991
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:03,349
form yeah this kind of blends the
machine in physics with the biology

8992
02:22:03,349 --> 02:22:03,359
machine in physics with the biology
 

8993
02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:05,110
machine in physics with the biology
developments and i think

8994
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,120
developments and i think
 

8995
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:05,990
developments and i think
you know there's a lot of great work

8996
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:06,000
you know there's a lot of great work
 

8997
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,510
you know there's a lot of great work
being done in longevity

8998
02:22:07,510 --> 02:22:07,520
being done in longevity
 

8999
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:09,270
being done in longevity
i have one of my companies itself works

9000
02:22:09,270 --> 02:22:09,280
i have one of my companies itself works
 

9001
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:10,790
i have one of my companies itself works
on longevity it's called longevity and

9002
02:22:10,790 --> 02:22:10,800
on longevity it's called longevity and
 

9003
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:13,910
on longevity it's called longevity and
so i i'm working on myself on ways to

9004
02:22:13,910 --> 02:22:13,920
so i i'm working on myself on ways to
 

9005
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:15,270
so i i'm working on myself on ways to
improve how we monitor health and

9006
02:22:15,270 --> 02:22:15,280
improve how we monitor health and
 

9007
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:17,750
improve how we monitor health and
wellness now and live longer live better

9008
02:22:17,750 --> 02:22:17,760
wellness now and live longer live better
 

9009
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:18,950
wellness now and live longer live better
many people are doing this is what the

9010
02:22:18,950 --> 02:22:18,960
many people are doing this is what the
 

9011
02:22:18,960 --> 02:22:20,630
many people are doing this is what the
whole purpose of medicine is to a large

9012
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:20,640
whole purpose of medicine is to a large
 

9013
02:22:20,640 --> 02:22:21,510
whole purpose of medicine is to a large
degree

9014
02:22:21,510 --> 02:22:21,520
degree
 

9015
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:23,830
degree
but i don't think we'll live in the book

9016
02:22:23,830 --> 02:22:23,840
but i don't think we'll live in the book
 

9017
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:25,590
but i don't think we'll live in the book
i propose we might get out to a lived

9018
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:25,600
i propose we might get out to a lived
 

9019
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:28,389
i propose we might get out to a lived
150 years i think that's reasonable but

9020
02:22:28,389 --> 02:22:28,399
150 years i think that's reasonable but
 

9021
02:22:28,399 --> 02:22:29,750
150 years i think that's reasonable but
say humans are going to have to be two

9022
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:29,760
say humans are going to have to be two
 

9023
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:31,429
say humans are going to have to be two
three four five hundred years or some

9024
02:22:31,429 --> 02:22:31,439
three four five hundred years or some
 

9025
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:32,790
three four five hundred years or some
people i meet people like this every

9026
02:22:32,790 --> 02:22:32,800
people i meet people like this every
 

9027
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:34,389
people i meet people like this every
week because i think i'm not going to

9028
02:22:34,389 --> 02:22:34,399
week because i think i'm not going to
 

9029
02:22:34,399 --> 02:22:36,389
week because i think i'm not going to
die to which i always say i hope you're

9030
02:22:36,389 --> 02:22:36,399
die to which i always say i hope you're
 

9031
02:22:36,399 --> 02:22:38,070
die to which i always say i hope you're
right but i think you should plan that

9032
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:38,080
right but i think you should plan that
 

9033
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:40,309
right but i think you should plan that
you're not going to be right but i want

9034
02:22:40,309 --> 02:22:40,319
you're not going to be right but i want
 

9035
02:22:40,319 --> 02:22:41,910
you're not going to be right but i want
people also as we mentioned earlier

9036
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:41,920
people also as we mentioned earlier
 

9037
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,790
people also as we mentioned earlier
being immortal would really

9038
02:22:42,790 --> 02:22:42,800
being immortal would really
 

9039
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:44,469
being immortal would really
fundamentally change the social contract

9040
02:22:44,469 --> 02:22:44,479
fundamentally change the social contract
 

9041
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:46,309
fundamentally change the social contract
and how you plan and how you allocate

9042
02:22:46,309 --> 02:22:46,319
and how you plan and how you allocate
 

9043
02:22:46,319 --> 02:22:47,910
and how you plan and how you allocate
resources not necessarily bad but it

9044
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:47,920
resources not necessarily bad but it
 

9045
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:49,670
resources not necessarily bad but it
would just be different

9046
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:49,680
would just be different
 

9047
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:51,429
would just be different
but i also just think we don't know yet

9048
02:22:51,429 --> 02:22:51,439
but i also just think we don't know yet
 

9049
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:53,270
but i also just think we don't know yet
of any way to

9050
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:53,280
of any way to
 

9051
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:55,270
of any way to
undo the ravages to the human body that

9052
02:22:55,270 --> 02:22:55,280
undo the ravages to the human body that
 

9053
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:57,190
undo the ravages to the human body that
occur over time we can repair some of it

9054
02:22:57,190 --> 02:22:57,200
occur over time we can repair some of it
 

9055
02:22:57,200 --> 02:22:59,190
occur over time we can repair some of it
replace some of it but

9056
02:22:59,190 --> 02:22:59,200
replace some of it but
 

9057
02:22:59,200 --> 02:23:01,910
replace some of it but
you know it's okay to assume that you're

9058
02:23:01,910 --> 02:23:01,920
you know it's okay to assume that you're
 

9059
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:04,309
you know it's okay to assume that you're
going to die and i just assume no you're

9060
02:23:04,309 --> 02:23:04,319
going to die and i just assume no you're
 

9061
02:23:04,319 --> 02:23:05,910
going to die and i just assume no you're
going to die because then you have a bit

9062
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:05,920
going to die because then you have a bit
 

9063
02:23:05,920 --> 02:23:07,830
going to die because then you have a bit
of liberty about what you can do quickly

9064
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:07,840
of liberty about what you can do quickly
 

9065
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:09,270
of liberty about what you can do quickly
and do next

9066
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:09,280
and do next
 

9067
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:10,950
and do next
the uh but but i think we will get

9068
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:10,960
the uh but but i think we will get
 

9069
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:12,790
the uh but but i think we will get
better i think we could see people live

9070
02:23:12,790 --> 02:23:12,800
better i think we could see people live
 

9071
02:23:12,800 --> 02:23:14,550
better i think we could see people live
potentially to 150 with some of the

9072
02:23:14,550 --> 02:23:14,560
potentially to 150 with some of the
 

9073
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:17,429
potentially to 150 with some of the
tools and methods and living longer

9074
02:23:17,429 --> 02:23:17,439
tools and methods and living longer
 

9075
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:19,190
tools and methods and living longer
but upload you know

9076
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:19,200
but upload you know
 

9077
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:22,630
but upload you know
living my in a living brain like in the

9078
02:23:22,630 --> 02:23:22,640
living my in a living brain like in the
 

9079
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:24,150
living my in a living brain like in the
kurzweil singularity where we all have

9080
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:24,160
kurzweil singularity where we all have
 

9081
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:25,910
kurzweil singularity where we all have
this rapture-like moment and we go up

9082
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:25,920
this rapture-like moment and we go up
 

9083
02:23:25,920 --> 02:23:27,830
this rapture-like moment and we go up
and upload into the cloud and live

9084
02:23:27,830 --> 02:23:27,840
and upload into the cloud and live
 

9085
02:23:27,840 --> 02:23:29,349
and upload into the cloud and live
forever um

9086
02:23:29,349 --> 02:23:29,359
forever um
 

9087
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:30,469
forever um
i don't know if it would still be the

9088
02:23:30,469 --> 02:23:30,479
i don't know if it would still be the
 

9089
02:23:30,479 --> 02:23:33,510
i don't know if it would still be the
same as what we consider the view of

9090
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:33,520
same as what we consider the view of
 

9091
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:36,150
same as what we consider the view of
self in this flesh form

9092
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:36,160
self in this flesh form
 

9093
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:37,510
self in this flesh form
if we could really get a complete

9094
02:23:37,510 --> 02:23:37,520
if we could really get a complete
 

9095
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:39,270
if we could really get a complete
representation of a person's entire

9096
02:23:39,270 --> 02:23:39,280
representation of a person's entire
 

9097
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:41,190
representation of a person's entire
personality up into

9098
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:41,200
personality up into
 

9099
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:42,950
personality up into
digital form i mean that would be

9100
02:23:42,950 --> 02:23:42,960
digital form i mean that would be
 

9101
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:45,190
digital form i mean that would be
immortality basically or a loose

9102
02:23:45,190 --> 02:23:45,200
immortality basically or a loose
 

9103
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:47,030
immortality basically or a loose
representation i'd go through the

9104
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,040
representation i'd go through the
 

9105
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:48,630
representation i'd go through the
thought experiment of

9106
02:23:48,630 --> 02:23:48,640
thought experiment of
 

9107
02:23:48,640 --> 02:23:49,750
thought experiment of
i like

9108
02:23:49,750 --> 02:23:49,760
i like
 

9109
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,830
i like
thinking about clones

9110
02:23:51,830 --> 02:23:51,840
thinking about clones
 

9111
02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:53,349
thinking about clones
uh

9112
02:23:53,349 --> 02:23:53,359
uh
 

9113
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:55,750
uh
like twins twins are clones basically

9114
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:55,760
like twins twins are clones basically
 

9115
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:58,630
like twins twins are clones basically
basically but

9116
02:23:58,630 --> 02:23:58,640
basically but
 

9117
02:23:58,640 --> 02:24:01,110
basically but
um the ability to generate i mean you're

9118
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:01,120
um the ability to generate i mean you're
 

9119
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:03,990
um the ability to generate i mean you're
stuck with the those cl like the twins

9120
02:24:03,990 --> 02:24:04,000
stuck with the those cl like the twins
 

9121
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,830
stuck with the those cl like the twins
is a fixed number of clones so that's a

9122
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:05,840
is a fixed number of clones so that's a
 

9123
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:08,389
is a fixed number of clones so that's a
genetic clone i mean a philosophical

9124
02:24:08,389 --> 02:24:08,399
genetic clone i mean a philosophical
 

9125
02:24:08,399 --> 02:24:10,070
genetic clone i mean a philosophical
clone where you can keep generating them

9126
02:24:10,070 --> 02:24:10,080
clone where you can keep generating them
 

9127
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:13,429
clone where you can keep generating them
versions and then i the reason

9128
02:24:13,429 --> 02:24:13,439
versions and then i the reason
 

9129
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:16,230
versions and then i the reason
i really like that construction

9130
02:24:16,230 --> 02:24:16,240
i really like that construction
 

9131
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:17,750
i really like that construction
thinking about that like for me

9132
02:24:17,750 --> 02:24:17,760
thinking about that like for me
 

9133
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:19,990
thinking about that like for me
personally is

9134
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:20,000
personally is
 

9135
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:20,950
personally is
it

9136
02:24:20,950 --> 02:24:20,960
it
 

9137
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:23,270
it
nicely encapsulates how i feel about

9138
02:24:23,270 --> 02:24:23,280
nicely encapsulates how i feel about
 

9139
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,910
nicely encapsulates how i feel about
being human because why do i matter if

9140
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:25,920
being human because why do i matter if
 

9141
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:27,590
being human because why do i matter if
i'm

9142
02:24:27,590 --> 02:24:27,600
i'm
 

9143
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:31,750
i'm
how would i if i do another copy of me

9144
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:31,760
how would i if i do another copy of me
 

9145
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:34,230
how would i if i do another copy of me
how would i defend

9146
02:24:34,230 --> 02:24:34,240
how would i defend
 

9147
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:36,950
how would i defend
uh why i matter as a human being and i

9148
02:24:36,950 --> 02:24:36,960
uh why i matter as a human being and i
 

9149
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:39,510
uh why i matter as a human being and i
don't think i can because that clone if

9150
02:24:39,510 --> 02:24:39,520
don't think i can because that clone if
 

9151
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:41,270
don't think i can because that clone if
it's just fine

9152
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:41,280
it's just fine
 

9153
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:42,950
it's just fine
not even a perfect like a reasonable

9154
02:24:42,950 --> 02:24:42,960
not even a perfect like a reasonable
 

9155
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:45,590
not even a perfect like a reasonable
clone like most people i know

9156
02:24:45,590 --> 02:24:45,600
clone like most people i know
 

9157
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:48,309
clone like most people i know
um that love me and who i love they'll

9158
02:24:48,309 --> 02:24:48,319
um that love me and who i love they'll
 

9159
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:51,510
um that love me and who i love they'll
be just fine with the corner

9160
02:24:51,510 --> 02:24:51,520
be just fine with the corner
 

9161
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:53,110
be just fine with the corner
they'd be like and some they'll be

9162
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:53,120
they'd be like and some they'll be
 

9163
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:56,710
they'd be like and some they'll be
surprised like oh you're like

9164
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:56,720
surprised like oh you're like
 

9165
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,870
surprised like oh you're like
your move kind of weird but like overall

9166
02:24:58,870 --> 02:24:58,880
your move kind of weird but like overall
 

9167
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:00,870
your move kind of weird but like overall
but otherwise i'll take it yeah and if

9168
02:25:00,870 --> 02:25:00,880
but otherwise i'll take it yeah and if
 

9169
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:02,630
but otherwise i'll take it yeah and if
that's possible to do that kind of

9170
02:25:02,630 --> 02:25:02,640
that's possible to do that kind of
 

9171
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:04,469
that's possible to do that kind of
copying

9172

copying
 

9173
02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:06,230
copying
and no i don't want to say perfect one

9174
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:06,240
and no i don't want to say perfect one
 

9175
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:07,590
and no i don't want to say perfect one
because i think perfect cologne is very

9176
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:07,600
because i think perfect cologne is very
 

9177
02:25:07,600 --> 02:25:09,590
because i think perfect cologne is very
difficult engineering wise i mean like a

9178
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,600
difficult engineering wise i mean like a
 

9179
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:12,630
difficult engineering wise i mean like a
pretty crappy copy would still be okay

9180
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:12,640
pretty crappy copy would still be okay
 

9181
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:14,309
pretty crappy copy would still be okay
just like wears

9182

02:25:22,070 --> 02:25:22,080
like uh you know in the digital space
 

9191
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:24,630
like uh you know in the digital space
especially with the metaverse

9192
02:25:24,630 --> 02:25:24,640
especially with the metaverse
 

9193
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:26,309
especially with the metaverse
you can clone

9194
02:25:26,309 --> 02:25:26,319
you can clone
 

9195
02:25:26,319 --> 02:25:28,630
you can clone
i think you know in the next few decades

9196
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:28,640
i think you know in the next few decades
 

9197
02:25:28,640 --> 02:25:30,309
i think you know in the next few decades
you'll be able to clone

9198

people's behavioral patterns uh pretty

9200
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:32,720
people's behavioral patterns uh pretty
 

9201
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:33,910
people's behavioral patterns uh pretty
well

9202
02:25:33,910 --> 02:25:33,920
well
 

9203
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:36,070
well
and visual uh

9204
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:36,080
and visual uh
 

9205
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:37,429
and visual uh
at least in the

9206
02:25:37,429 --> 02:25:37,439
at least in the
 

9207
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:39,270
at least in the
in the virtual reality in the digital

9208
02:25:39,270 --> 02:25:39,280
in the virtual reality in the digital
 

9209
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:41,270
in the virtual reality in the digital
representation if you are and then you

9210
02:25:41,270 --> 02:25:41,280
representation if you are and then you
 

9211
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:43,190
representation if you are and then you
have to really contenders like why do i

9212
02:25:43,190 --> 02:25:43,200
have to really contenders like why do i
 

9213
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,670
have to really contenders like why do i
matter is maybe what matters isn't the

9214
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:45,680
matter is maybe what matters isn't the
 

9215
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:47,750
matter is maybe what matters isn't the
individual person but what matters are

9216
02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:47,760
individual person but what matters are
 

9217
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:50,550
individual person but what matters are
the ideas that that person plays with

9218
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:50,560
the ideas that that person plays with
 

9219
02:25:50,560 --> 02:25:52,230
the ideas that that person plays with
um so it doesn't matter if there's a

9220
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:52,240
um so it doesn't matter if there's a
 

9221
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:55,349
um so it doesn't matter if there's a
thousand clones what matters is that i'm

9222
02:25:55,349 --> 02:25:55,359
thousand clones what matters is that i'm
 

9223
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:57,429
thousand clones what matters is that i'm
currently thinking about

9224
02:25:57,429 --> 02:25:57,439
currently thinking about
 

9225
02:25:57,439 --> 02:25:58,870
currently thinking about
x or some kind of problem that i'm

x or some kind of problem that i'm
 

9227
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:00,309
x or some kind of problem that i'm
trying to solve and those ideas and i'm

9228
02:26:00,309 --> 02:26:00,319
trying to solve and those ideas and i'm
 

9229
02:26:00,319 --> 02:26:02,469
trying to solve and those ideas and i'm
sharing those ideas maybe ideas of the

9230
02:26:02,469 --> 02:26:02,479
sharing those ideas maybe ideas of the
 

9231
02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:04,150
sharing those ideas maybe ideas of the
organisms and not the

9232
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:04,160
organisms and not the
 

9233
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:06,469
organisms and not the
the meat vehicles of the organism maybe

9234
02:26:06,469 --> 02:26:06,479
the meat vehicles of the organism maybe
 

9235
02:26:06,479 --> 02:26:09,349
the meat vehicles of the organism maybe
that's a cultural shift where we won't

9236
02:26:09,349 --> 02:26:09,359
that's a cultural shift where we won't
 

9237
02:26:09,359 --> 02:26:12,389
that's a cultural shift where we won't

and the argument he makes is it's more
than just what percentage of your

than just what percentage of your
 

9303
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:09,910
than just what percentage of your
neurons are swapped out it's also the

neurons are swapped out it's also the
 

9305
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:11,110
neurons are swapped out it's also the

he actually goes so far to say
 

9317
02:27:21,040 --> 02:27:22,309
he actually goes so far to say
that they're probably you know more

9318
02:27:22,309 --> 02:27:22,319
that they're probably you know more
 

9319
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:23,510
that they're probably you know more
important than even what's in your head

like if you swap out you know all of
your thoughts but when you walk out into

your thoughts but when you walk out into
 

9325
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:28,630

02:27:30,240 --> 02:27:32,550
talks you the same way as this memory of
what you are that is like an entity

9330
02:27:32,550 --> 02:27:32,560
what you are that is like an entity
 

9331
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:34,550
what you are that is like an entity
that's defined you even if all of your

9332
02:27:34,550 --> 02:27:34,560
that's defined you even if all of your
 

9333
02:27:34,560 --> 02:27:36,070
that's defined you even if all of your
you know there's even movies like

9334
02:27:36,070 --> 02:27:36,080
you know there's even movies like
 

9335
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:37,429
you know there's even movies like
trading spaces about this with eddie

9336
02:27:37,429 --> 02:27:37,439
trading spaces about this with eddie
 

9337
02:27:37,439 --> 02:27:38,790
trading spaces about this with eddie
murphy or like these are people who can

9338
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:38,800
murphy or like these are people who can
 

9339
02:27:38,800 --> 02:27:40,230
murphy or like these are people who can
swap bodies

9340
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:40,240
swap bodies
 

9341
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:41,750
swap bodies
uh the reason those are comedy is

9342
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:41,760
uh the reason those are comedy is
 

9343
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:42,710
uh the reason those are comedy is
because they're fish out of water

9344
02:27:42,710 --> 02:27:42,720
because they're fish out of water
 

9345
02:27:42,720 --> 02:27:44,230
because they're fish out of water
comedies and but but they go to the

9346
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:44,240
comedies and but but they go to the
 

9347
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:45,910
comedies and but but they go to the
point of what defines you as not just

9348
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:45,920
point of what defines you as not just
 

9349
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:47,830
point of what defines you as not just
you but also your viewed well you as an

9350
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:47,840
you but also your viewed well you as an
 

9351
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:50,150
you but also your viewed well you as an
entity exist in the memories of other of

9352
02:27:50,150 --> 02:27:50,160
entity exist in the memories of other of
 

9353
02:27:50,160 --> 02:27:52,070
entity exist in the memories of other of
other beings and so

9354
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:52,080
other beings and so
 

9355
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,550
other beings and so
that yeah the the

9356
02:27:54,550 --> 02:27:54,560
that yeah the the
 

9357
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:56,150
that yeah the the
the entities

9358
02:27:56,150 --> 02:27:56,160
the entities
 

9359
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:58,389
the entities
as they exist in their form in those

9360
02:27:58,389 --> 02:27:58,399
as they exist in their form in those
 

9361
02:27:58,399 --> 02:28:00,950
as they exist in their form in those
memories perhaps are more important

9362
02:28:00,950 --> 02:28:00,960
memories perhaps are more important
 

9363
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:03,750
memories perhaps are more important
to who you are than what's in your head

9364
02:28:03,750 --> 02:28:03,760
to who you are than what's in your head
 

9365
02:28:03,760 --> 02:28:06,790
to who you are than what's in your head
and that clones then

9366
02:28:06,790 --> 02:28:06,800
and that clones then
 

9367
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:08,309
and that clones then
are um

9368
02:28:08,309 --> 02:28:08,319
are um
 

9369
02:28:08,319 --> 02:28:10,230
are um
how do they do they lessen

9370
02:28:10,230 --> 02:28:10,240
how do they do they lessen
 

9371
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:12,790
how do they do they lessen
not really they just distribute they

9372
02:28:12,790 --> 02:28:12,800
not really they just distribute they
 

9373
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:15,429
not really they just distribute they
just scale the eunice that can be

9374
02:28:15,429 --> 02:28:15,439
just scale the eunice that can be
 

9375
02:28:15,439 --> 02:28:17,590
just scale the eunice that can be
experienced by other humans like if i

9376
02:28:17,590 --> 02:28:17,600
experienced by other humans like if i
 

9377
02:28:17,600 --> 02:28:19,910
experienced by other humans like if i
could be doing five podcasts right now

9378
02:28:19,910 --> 02:28:19,920
could be doing five podcasts right now
 

9379
02:28:19,920 --> 02:28:21,670
could be doing five podcasts right now
at the same time then theory but i'd

9380
02:28:21,670 --> 02:28:21,680
at the same time then theory but i'd
 

9381
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:23,429
at the same time then theory but i'd
have to have some way to transmit the

9382
02:28:23,429 --> 02:28:23,439
have to have some way to transmit the
 

9383
02:28:23,439 --> 02:28:25,110
have to have some way to transmit the
memory of which one i did

9384
02:28:25,110 --> 02:28:25,120
memory of which one i did
 

9385
02:28:25,120 --> 02:28:26,950
memory of which one i did
which would be hard but not impossible

9386
02:28:26,950 --> 02:28:26,960
which would be hard but not impossible
 

9387
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,389
which would be hard but not impossible
if it's all digital you could aggregate

9388
02:28:28,389 --> 02:28:28,399
if it's all digital you could aggregate
 

9389
02:28:28,399 --> 02:28:29,830
if it's all digital you could aggregate
and accrete more and more of the

9390
02:28:29,830 --> 02:28:29,840
and accrete more and more of the
 

9391
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:31,750
and accrete more and more of the
memories into one entity oh i see but i

9392
02:28:31,750 --> 02:28:31,760
memories into one entity oh i see but i
 

9393
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:34,150
memories into one entity oh i see but i
thought at the at the moment of cloning

9394
02:28:34,150 --> 02:28:34,160
thought at the at the moment of cloning
 

9395
02:28:34,160 --> 02:28:36,550
thought at the at the moment of cloning
it's like cloning a git repository then

9396
02:28:36,550 --> 02:28:36,560
it's like cloning a git repository then
 

9397
02:28:36,560 --> 02:28:40,230
it's like cloning a git repository then
you're no longer is branched you share

9398
02:28:40,230 --> 02:28:40,240
you're no longer is branched you share
 

9399
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:42,550
you're no longer is branched you share
you share the version view one of chris

9400
02:28:42,550 --> 02:28:42,560
you share the version view one of chris
 

9401
02:28:42,560 --> 02:28:44,469
you share the version view one of chris
that a lot of people have experienced

9402
02:28:44,469 --> 02:28:44,479
that a lot of people have experienced
 

9403
02:28:44,479 --> 02:28:45,270
that a lot of people have experienced
like

9404
02:28:45,270 --> 02:28:45,280
like
 

9405
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:47,030
like
your high school friends college friends

9406
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,040
your high school friends college friends
 

9407
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:48,790
your high school friends college friends
colleagues and so on but now you moved

9408
02:28:48,790 --> 02:28:48,800
colleagues and so on but now you moved
 

9409
02:28:48,800 --> 02:28:51,190
colleagues and so on but now you moved
on to your music career and one of your

9410
02:28:51,190 --> 02:28:51,200
on to your music career and one of your
 

9411
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:52,309
on to your music career and one of your
clones did

9412
02:28:52,309 --> 02:28:52,319
clones did
 

9413
02:28:52,319 --> 02:28:53,510
clones did
and then that

9414
02:28:53,510 --> 02:28:53,520
and then that
 

9415
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:55,270
and then that
that's fundamentally new experiences

9416
02:28:55,270 --> 02:28:55,280
that's fundamentally new experiences
 

9417
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,790
that's fundamentally new experiences
that you you still

9418
02:28:56,790 --> 02:28:56,800
that you you still
 

9419
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:59,110
that you you still
um your colleagues can still experience

9420
02:28:59,110 --> 02:28:59,120
um your colleagues can still experience
 

9421
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:00,950
um your colleagues can still experience
the memories of the old christmas but

9422
02:29:00,950 --> 02:29:00,960
the memories of the old christmas but
 

9423
02:29:00,960 --> 02:29:02,309
the memories of the old christmas but
the new one

9424
02:29:02,309 --> 02:29:02,319
the new one
 

9425
02:29:02,319 --> 02:29:04,150
the new one
is totally you're going to have new

9426
02:29:04,150 --> 02:29:04,160
is totally you're going to have new
 

9427
02:29:04,160 --> 02:29:06,070
is totally you're going to have new
communities experiencing connecting to

9428
02:29:06,070 --> 02:29:06,080
communities experiencing connecting to
 

9429
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:08,630
communities experiencing connecting to
those and then you can just propagate

9430
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:08,640
those and then you can just propagate
 

9431
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:11,349
those and then you can just propagate
and the ones that are don't get a lot of

9432
02:29:11,349 --> 02:29:11,359
and the ones that are don't get a lot of
 

9433
02:29:11,359 --> 02:29:14,230
and the ones that are don't get a lot of
likes on social media we can we can

9434
02:29:14,230 --> 02:29:14,240
likes on social media we can we can
 

9435
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:16,230
likes on social media we can we can
like quietly dispose of

9436
02:29:16,230 --> 02:29:16,240
like quietly dispose of
 

9437
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:18,070
like quietly dispose of
when it maximizes the clones of chris

9438
02:29:18,070 --> 02:29:18,080
when it maximizes the clones of chris
 

9439
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:20,550
when it maximizes the clones of chris
that can uh get a lot of likes on

9440
02:29:20,550 --> 02:29:20,560
that can uh get a lot of likes on
 

9441
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:23,030
that can uh get a lot of likes on
facebook okay

are you working on

9448
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:31,680
are you working on
 

9449
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:33,590
are you working on
ai stuff too

9450
02:29:33,590 --> 02:29:33,600
ai stuff too
 

9451
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:35,110
ai stuff too
a lot of machine learning tools for

9452
02:29:35,110 --> 02:29:35,120
a lot of machine learning tools for
 

9453
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:36,469
a lot of machine learning tools for
genomics yeah but

9454
02:29:36,469 --> 02:29:36,479
genomics yeah but
 

9455
02:29:36,479 --> 02:29:38,790
genomics yeah but
because i i was seeing this interspersed

9456
02:29:38,790 --> 02:29:38,800
because i i was seeing this interspersed
 

9457
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:41,990
because i i was seeing this interspersed
because you're such a biology uh

9458
02:29:41,990 --> 02:29:42,000
because you're such a biology uh
 

9459
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,830
because you're such a biology uh
i mean i suppose computational biology

9460
02:29:43,830 --> 02:29:43,840
i mean i suppose computational biology
 

9461
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:44,870
i mean i suppose computational biology
person

9462
02:29:44,870 --> 02:29:44,880
person
 

9463
02:29:44,880 --> 02:29:47,590
person
uh but what about the

9464
02:29:47,590 --> 02:29:47,600
uh but what about the
 

9465
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:49,349
uh but what about the
are you working on age of

9466
02:29:49,349 --> 02:29:49,359
are you working on age of
 

9467
02:29:49,359 --> 02:29:51,510
are you working on age of
uh yes yeah like so i you've heard about

9468
02:29:51,510 --> 02:29:51,520
uh yes yeah like so i you've heard about
 

9469
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:53,990
uh yes yeah like so i you've heard about
the book i guess yeah yeah what that's

9470
02:29:53,990 --> 02:29:54,000
the book i guess yeah yeah what that's
 

9471
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:55,910
the book i guess yeah yeah what that's
actually written with the philanthropist

9472
02:29:55,910 --> 02:29:55,920
actually written with the philanthropist
 

9473
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:57,190
actually written with the philanthropist
i mentioned who we named the fungus

9474
02:29:57,190 --> 02:29:57,200
i mentioned who we named the fungus
 

9475
02:29:57,200 --> 02:29:58,950
i mentioned who we named the fungus
after the space station so that's coming

9476
02:29:58,950 --> 02:29:58,960
after the space station so that's coming
 

9477
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:00,630
after the space station so that's coming
out uh next year actually yeah what's

9478
02:30:00,630 --> 02:30:00,640
out uh next year actually yeah what's
 

9479
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:02,150
out uh next year actually yeah what's
the effort there what's what's your

9480
02:30:02,150 --> 02:30:02,160
the effort there what's what's your
 

9481
02:30:02,160 --> 02:30:05,349
the effort there what's what's your
interest in uh sort of the more narrow

9482
02:30:05,349 --> 02:30:05,359
interest in uh sort of the more narrow
 

9483
02:30:05,359 --> 02:30:08,230
interest in uh sort of the more narrow
ai tools of prediction and machine

9484
02:30:08,230 --> 02:30:08,240
ai tools of prediction and machine
 

9485
02:30:08,240 --> 02:30:10,070
ai tools of prediction and machine
learning all that kind of stuff yeah i

9486
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:10,080
learning all that kind of stuff yeah i
 

9487
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:11,670
learning all that kind of stuff yeah i
think called the age of prediction so

9488
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:11,680

predictive algorithms have fundamentally
changed our life so some of them are

9496
02:30:19,429 --> 02:30:19,439
changed our life so some of them are
 

9497
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:21,830
changed our life so some of them are
obvious to me where for example when we

9498
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:21,840
obvious to me where for example when we
 

9499
02:30:21,840 --> 02:30:24,630
obvious to me where for example when we
sequence cancer patients dna and we have

9500
02:30:24,630 --> 02:30:24,640
sequence cancer patients dna and we have
 

9501
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:26,230
sequence cancer patients dna and we have
predictions of exactly which drug will

computational tools to look at each

9512
02:30:35,990 --> 02:30:36,000
computational tools to look at each
 

9513
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,990
computational tools to look at each
piece of dna and what it might reveal

9514
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:38,000
piece of dna and what it might reveal
 

9515
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,830
piece of dna and what it might reveal
for its epigenetic state and then

9516
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:39,840
for its epigenetic state and then

predicting essentially how old you are

9518
02:30:41,910 --> 02:30:41,920
predicting essentially how old you are
 

9519
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:44,230
predicting essentially how old you are
at any given moment and that also gets

9520
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:44,240
at any given moment and that also gets
 

9521
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:45,510
at any given moment and that also gets
to longevity because sometimes you can

9522
02:30:45,510 --> 02:30:45,520
to longevity because sometimes you can
 

9523
02:30:45,520 --> 02:30:47,110
to longevity because sometimes you can
see if you're getting if you're aging

9524
02:30:47,110 --> 02:30:47,120
see if you're getting if you're aging
 

9525

some tools are in medicine or even

9528
02:30:50,309 --> 02:30:50,319
some tools are in medicine or even
 

9529
02:30:50,319 --> 02:30:52,550
some tools are in medicine or even
forensics but my favorite part a lot of

9530
02:30:52,550 --> 02:30:52,560
forensics but my favorite part a lot of
 

9531
02:30:52,560 --> 02:30:54,070
forensics but my favorite part a lot of
the book is where does this show up in

9532
02:30:54,070 --> 02:30:54,080
the book is where does this show up in
 

9533
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:56,870
the book is where does this show up in
economics as well as in medicine so

9534
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:56,880
economics as well as in medicine so
 

9535
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:58,389
economics as well as in medicine so
predictive tools i mean i think the most

02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:08,960
monitoring feeds and so prediction is

not just better medicine or in finance

9550
02:31:11,349 --> 02:31:11,359
not just better medicine or in finance
 

9551
02:31:11,359 --> 02:31:12,790
not just better medicine or in finance

it social contagion experiments to see
 

9567
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,550
it social contagion experiments to see
can we restructure what people

can we restructure what people
 

9569
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:27,990
can we restructure what people
see and then how they respond actually

9570
02:31:27,990 --> 02:31:28,000
see and then how they respond actually
 

9571
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,469

kind of uh be really predictive and

9572
02:31:30,469 --> 02:31:30,479
kind of uh be really predictive and

02:31:30,479 --> 02:31:32,710
kind of uh be really predictive and

manipulative frankly with what happens
 

9575
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:33,990
manipulative frankly with what happens
and then can that change how they vote

9576
02:31:33,990 --> 02:31:34,000
and then can that change how they vote
 

9577
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:35,349
and then can that change how they vote
and the answers seem to be yes for a

9581
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:38,870
good amount of the populous in 2016 in
the u.s so

9582
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:38,880
the u.s so
 

9583
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:39,910
the u.s so
i think we're seeing more and more of

9584
02:31:39,910 --> 02:31:39,920
i think we're seeing more and more of
 

9585
02:31:39,920 --> 02:31:41,510
i think we're seeing more and more of
these algorithms show up all over the

9586
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,520
these algorithms show up all over the
 

9587
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:43,349
these algorithms show up all over the
place and so the book is about where

9588
02:31:43,349 --> 02:31:43,359
place and so the book is about where
 

9589
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:44,630
place and so the book is about where
they appear where they're good for

9590
02:31:44,630 --> 02:31:44,640
they appear where they're good for
 

9591
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,990
they appear where they're good for
example in medicine they're phenomenal

9592
02:31:45,990 --> 02:31:46,000
example in medicine they're phenomenal
 

9593
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:47,349
example in medicine they're phenomenal
they have fundamentally changed how we

9594
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
they have fundamentally changed how we
 

9595
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,030
they have fundamentally changed how we
treat cancer patients but where they're

9596
02:31:49,030 --> 02:31:49,040
treat cancer patients but where they're
 

9597
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:50,630
treat cancer patients but where they're
risky like if someone's trying to steal

9598
02:31:50,630 --> 02:31:50,640
risky like if someone's trying to steal
 

9599
02:31:50,640 --> 02:31:51,830

your vote

9600
02:31:51,830 --> 02:31:51,840
your vote
 

9601
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:53,910
your vote
or manipulate your thoughts potentially

9602
02:31:53,910 --> 02:31:53,920
or manipulate your thoughts potentially
 

9603
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:55,110
or manipulate your thoughts potentially
negatively

9604
02:31:55,110 --> 02:31:55,120
negatively
 

9605
02:31:55,120 --> 02:31:57,590
negatively
so in medicine you're hopeful about

9606
02:31:57,590 --> 02:31:57,600
so in medicine you're hopeful about
 

9607
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:59,270
so in medicine you're hopeful about
prediction yeah most of the ai and

9608
02:31:59,270 --> 02:31:59,280
prediction yeah most of the ai and
 

9609
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:01,429
prediction yeah most of the ai and
medicine the machine learning tools for

9610
02:32:01,429 --> 02:32:01,439
medicine the machine learning tools for
 

9611
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:02,870
medicine the machine learning tools for

image recognition for example for
 

9613
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:04,870
image recognition for example for
pathology samples where normally i think

9614
02:32:04,870 --> 02:32:04,880
pathology samples where normally i think
 

9615
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:06,710
pathology samples where normally i think
if someone takes a bit of a bit of

if someone takes a bit of a bit of
 

9617
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:09,110
if someone takes a bit of a bit of
tissue and then puts it onto a slide

9618
02:32:09,110 --> 02:32:09,120
tissue and then puts it onto a slide
 

9619
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:10,710
tissue and then puts it onto a slide
normally there's pathologists that have

9620
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:10,720
normally there's pathologists that have
 

9621
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:12,469
normally there's pathologists that have
been training for years to look at a

9622
02:32:12,469 --> 02:32:12,479
been training for years to look at a
 

9623
02:32:12,479 --> 02:32:13,830
been training for years to look at a
chunk of your tissue and say okay is

9624
02:32:13,830 --> 02:32:13,840
chunk of your tissue and say okay is
 

9625
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:15,830

this cancer what kind of cancer what

9626
02:32:15,830 --> 02:32:15,840
this cancer what kind of cancer what
 

9627
02:32:15,840 --> 02:32:17,590
this cancer what kind of cancer what
treatment should i do but there's an old

9628
02:32:17,590 --> 02:32:17,600
treatment should i do but there's an old
 

9629
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:18,870
treatment should i do but there's an old
joke about pathologists that you can

9630
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:18,880
joke about pathologists that you can
 

9631
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:20,389
joke about pathologists that you can
give 10 slides to 10 different

9632
02:32:20,389 --> 02:32:20,399
give 10 slides to 10 different
 

9633
02:32:20,399 --> 02:32:22,469
give 10 slides to 10 different
pathologists and get 11 different

9634
02:32:22,469 --> 02:32:22,479
pathologists and get 11 different
 

9635
02:32:22,479 --> 02:32:24,950
pathologists and get 11 different
diagnoses which is as awful as it sounds

9636
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:24,960
diagnoses which is as awful as it sounds
 

9637
02:32:24,960 --> 02:32:26,550
diagnoses which is as awful as it sounds
because you're having someone squint at

9638
02:32:26,550 --> 02:32:26,560
because you're having someone squint at
 

9639
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:28,710
because you're having someone squint at
a stained microscope slide but instead

9640
02:32:28,710 --> 02:32:28,720
a stained microscope slide but instead
 

9641
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:30,230
a stained microscope slide but instead
if you use a lot of the ai tools where

9642
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:30,240
if you use a lot of the ai tools where
 

9643
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,150
if you use a lot of the ai tools where
you can actually segment the image high

9644
02:32:32,150 --> 02:32:32,160
you can actually segment the image high
 

9645
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:33,670
you can actually segment the image high

large training data set and then you
 

9653
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:40,230
large training data set and then you
have test samples afterward you can you

and uh these programmers came out and
 

9685
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:10,710
and uh these programmers came out and
they said listen here's this example of

02:33:10,710 --> 02:33:10,720
they said listen here's this example of

they said listen here's this example of
a patient and watch watson diagnose the

dean is there and he says you could
 

9703
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:27,510
dean is there and he says you could
imagine someday this could replace

9704

imagine someday this could replace

doctors in a room full of doctors right
 

9707
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:30,550
doctors in a room full of doctors right
so it was a really poor choice of words

9708
02:33:30,550 --> 02:33:30,560
so it was a really poor choice of words
 

9709
02:33:30,560 --> 02:33:32,150
so it was a really poor choice of words
because everyone's like no you want to

9710
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:32,160
because everyone's like no you want to
 

9711
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:34,389
because everyone's like no you want to
help the doctors but but i think the

9712
02:33:34,389 --> 02:33:34,399
help the doctors but but i think the
 

9713
02:33:34,399 --> 02:33:36,309
help the doctors but but i think the
view from the programmers is often a bit

9714
02:33:36,309 --> 02:33:36,319
view from the programmers is often a bit
 

9715
02:33:36,319 --> 02:33:38,309
view from the programmers is often a bit
naive that they could fundamentally

9716
02:33:38,309 --> 02:33:38,319
naive that they could fundamentally
 

9717
02:33:38,319 --> 02:33:39,990
naive that they could fundamentally
replace doctors now in some cases they

9718
02:33:39,990 --> 02:33:40,000
replace doctors now in some cases they

02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:41,750
replace doctors now in some cases they

just mentioned

9722
02:33:43,110 --> 02:33:43,120
just mentioned
 

9723
02:33:43,120 --> 02:33:45,030
just mentioned
i think the ai tools already do a better

9724
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:45,040
i think the ai tools already do a better
 

9725
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:46,309
i think the ai tools already do a better
job and we've only really been doing

9726
02:33:46,309 --> 02:33:46,319
job and we've only really been doing
 

9727
02:33:46,319 --> 02:33:47,429
job and we've only really been doing
this for about five years right so you

9728
02:33:47,429 --> 02:33:47,439
this for about five years right so you
 

9729
02:33:47,439 --> 02:33:48,469
this for about five years right so you
imagine another five years of

9730
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:48,479
imagine another five years of
 

9731
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:50,550
imagine another five years of
optimization and data

9732
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:50,560
optimization and data
 

9733
02:33:50,560 --> 02:33:51,830
optimization and data
they're gonna take over right so and

9734
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:51,840
they're gonna take over right so and
 

9735
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:53,030
they're gonna take over right so and
they should because staring and

9736
02:33:53,030 --> 02:33:53,040
they should because staring and
 

9737
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:54,710
they should because staring and
squinting at screens for hours on day is

9738
02:33:54,710 --> 02:33:54,720
squinting at screens for hours on day is
 

9739
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:56,870
squinting at screens for hours on day is
not the best use of human ingenuity so i

9740
02:33:56,870 --> 02:33:56,880
not the best use of human ingenuity so i
 

9741
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:57,670
not the best use of human ingenuity so i
think

9742
02:33:57,670 --> 02:33:57,680
think
 

9743
02:33:57,680 --> 02:33:59,110
think
some cases they'll take over other cases

9744
02:33:59,110 --> 02:33:59,120
some cases they'll take over other cases
 

9745
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:00,710
some cases they'll take over other cases
they'll augment they'll help

9746
02:34:00,710 --> 02:34:00,720
they'll augment they'll help
 

9747
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:02,870
they'll augment they'll help
yeah that human ingenuity

9748
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:02,880
yeah that human ingenuity
 

9749
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:04,710
yeah that human ingenuity
actually especially for ai people

it's the self-doubt that is essential

you have to know that

9828
02:35:28,550 --> 02:35:28,560
you have to know that
 

9829
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:30,630
you have to know that
this day that you're alive is

this day that you're alive is
 

9831
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:32,630
this day that you're alive is
quantifiably the best day that's ever

happened
and that tomorrow will be even better

9836
02:35:35,429 --> 02:35:35,439
and that tomorrow will be even better
 

9837
02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:37,349
and that tomorrow will be even better
than this day in terms of the capacity

9838
02:35:37,349 --> 02:35:37,359
than this day in terms of the capacity
 

9839
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:38,710
than this day in terms of the capacity
for discovery the amount of data that

9840
02:35:38,710 --> 02:35:38,720
for discovery the amount of data that
 

9841
02:35:38,720 --> 02:35:39,830
for discovery the amount of data that
exists

9842

you have to silence everything else to
let that sort of flame become a fire

now everyone takes me seriously because
 

10585
02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:39,750
now everyone takes me seriously because
i'm a professor and actually i've done

10586
02:47:39,750 --> 02:47:39,760
i'm a professor and actually i've done
 

10587
02:47:39,760 --> 02:47:41,750
i'm a professor and actually i've done
that you're mentoring people you're the

that you're mentoring people you're the
next generation yeah also

10590
02:47:43,990 --> 02:47:44,000
next generation yeah also
 

10591
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:45,910
next generation yeah also
patients yeah and helping patients live

10592
02:47:45,910 --> 02:47:45,920
patients yeah and helping patients live
 

10593
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:47,910
patients yeah and helping patients live
longer and seeing the hope in their eyes

10594
02:47:47,910 --> 02:47:47,920
longer and seeing the hope in their eyes
 

10595
02:47:47,920 --> 02:47:49,349
longer and seeing the hope in their eyes
when they went from even my own

10596
02:47:49,349 --> 02:47:49,359
when they went from even my own
 

10597
02:47:49,359 --> 02:47:50,550
when they went from even my own
grandfather went from a two-month

10598
02:47:50,550 --> 02:47:50,560
grandfather went from a two-month
 

10599
02:47:50,560 --> 02:47:52,870
grandfather went from a two-month
diagnostic diagnosis of living from

10600
02:47:52,870 --> 02:47:52,880
diagnostic diagnosis of living from
 

10601
02:47:52,880 --> 02:47:55,030
diagnostic diagnosis of living from
metastatic cancer to living for more

10602
02:47:55,030 --> 02:47:55,040
metastatic cancer to living for more
 

10603
02:47:55,040 --> 02:47:57,110
metastatic cancer to living for more
than two years eventually succumbed to

10604
02:47:57,110 --> 02:47:57,120
than two years eventually succumbed to
 

10605
02:47:57,120 --> 02:47:58,790
than two years eventually succumbed to
it but knowing can use the tools of

10606
02:47:58,790 --> 02:47:58,800
it but knowing can use the tools of
 

10607
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:00,790
it but knowing can use the tools of
predictive medicine to save people

10608
02:48:00,790 --> 02:48:00,800
predictive medicine to save people
 

10609
02:48:00,800 --> 02:48:03,110
predictive medicine to save people
um yeah and so now you know looking out

10610
02:48:03,110 --> 02:48:03,120
um yeah and so now you know looking out
 

10611
02:48:03,120 --> 02:48:04,630
um yeah and so now you know looking out
ahead

10612
02:48:04,630 --> 02:48:04,640
ahead
 

10613
02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:07,110
ahead
uh i feel like it's i would die very

10614
02:48:07,110 --> 02:48:07,120
uh i feel like it's i would die very
 

10615
02:48:07,120 --> 02:48:08,870
uh i feel like it's i would die very
happy if i saw boots on the red planet

10616
02:48:08,870 --> 02:48:08,880
happy if i saw boots on the red planet
 

10617
02:48:08,880 --> 02:48:11,110
happy if i saw boots on the red planet
and and people there and now the other

10618
02:48:11,110 --> 02:48:11,120
and and people there and now the other
 

10619
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:12,870
and and people there and now the other
advice to the younglings i'd say is the

10620
02:48:12,870 --> 02:48:12,880
advice to the younglings i'd say is the
 

10621
02:48:12,880 --> 02:48:14,469
advice to the younglings i'd say is the
first time i proposed the twin study to

10622
02:48:14,469 --> 02:48:14,479
first time i proposed the twin study to
 

10623
02:48:14,479 --> 02:48:16,950
first time i proposed the twin study to
nasa they said no uh several times said

10624
02:48:16,950 --> 02:48:16,960
nasa they said no uh several times said
 

10625
02:48:16,960 --> 02:48:18,230
nasa they said no uh several times said
no we don't we're not a plan for a

10626
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:18,240
no we don't we're not a plan for a
 

10627
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:19,269
no we don't we're not a plan for a
mission like that it's not going to

10628
02:48:19,269 --> 02:48:19,279
mission like that it's not going to
 

10629
02:48:19,279 --> 02:48:20,469
mission like that it's not going to
happen so

10630
02:48:20,469 --> 02:48:20,479
happen so
 

10631
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:22,870
happen so
uh don't you know be just perseverance

10632
02:48:22,870 --> 02:48:22,880
uh don't you know be just perseverance
 

10633
02:48:22,880 --> 02:48:24,870
uh don't you know be just perseverance
that will in the east you were i didn't

10634
02:48:24,870 --> 02:48:24,880
that will in the east you were i didn't
 

10635
02:48:24,880 --> 02:48:27,110
that will in the east you were i didn't
know i i knew you were part of leading

10636
02:48:27,110 --> 02:48:27,120
know i i knew you were part of leading
 

10637
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:29,590
know i i knew you were part of leading
the nasa twin study but you were also

10638
02:48:29,590 --> 02:48:29,600
the nasa twin study but you were also
 

10639
02:48:29,600 --> 02:48:31,990
the nasa twin study but you were also
part of the failure to do so earlier so

10640
02:48:31,990 --> 02:48:32,000
part of the failure to do so earlier so
 

10641
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,110
part of the failure to do so earlier so
the first actually because when you

10642
02:48:33,110 --> 02:48:33,120
the first actually because when you
 

10643
02:48:33,120 --> 02:48:34,710
the first actually because when you
start a lab in academia they say here's

10644
02:48:34,710 --> 02:48:34,720
start a lab in academia they say here's
 

10645
02:48:34,720 --> 02:48:36,790
start a lab in academia they say here's
a pile of money yes write grants and

10646
02:48:36,790 --> 02:48:36,800
a pile of money yes write grants and
 

10647
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:38,389
a pile of money yes write grants and
bring in more money and train people and

10648
02:48:38,389 --> 02:48:38,399
bring in more money and train people and
 

10649
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:40,870
bring in more money and train people and
start a lab but so i actually wrote nasa

10650
02:48:40,870 --> 02:48:40,880
start a lab but so i actually wrote nasa
 

10651
02:48:40,880 --> 02:48:42,630
start a lab but so i actually wrote nasa
and said i don't i'm not requesting any

10652
02:48:42,630 --> 02:48:42,640
and said i don't i'm not requesting any
 

10653
02:48:42,640 --> 02:48:44,309
and said i don't i'm not requesting any
funds i have funds they just gave me a

10654
02:48:44,309 --> 02:48:44,319
funds i have funds they just gave me a
 

10655
02:48:44,319 --> 02:48:45,750
funds i have funds they just gave me a
bunch of money i would like to though do

10656
02:48:45,750 --> 02:48:45,760
bunch of money i would like to though do
 

10657
02:48:45,760 --> 02:48:47,590
bunch of money i would like to though do
a deep genetic profile of astronauts

10658
02:48:47,590 --> 02:48:47,600
a deep genetic profile of astronauts
 

10659
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:49,429
a deep genetic profile of astronauts
before and after space flight and do it

10660
02:48:49,429 --> 02:48:49,439
before and after space flight and do it
 

10661
02:48:49,439 --> 02:48:51,030
before and after space flight and do it
ideally if we have some twins or do

10662
02:48:51,030 --> 02:48:51,040
ideally if we have some twins or do
 

10663
02:48:51,040 --> 02:48:53,670
ideally if we have some twins or do
genetics and epigenetics and microbiome

10664
02:48:53,670 --> 02:48:53,680
genetics and epigenetics and microbiome
 

10665
02:48:53,680 --> 02:48:55,030
genetics and epigenetics and microbiome
but john charles is the director of the

10666
02:48:55,030 --> 02:48:55,040
but john charles is the director of the
 

10667
02:48:55,040 --> 02:48:56,870
but john charles is the director of the
human research programs that we don't

10668
02:48:56,870 --> 02:48:56,880
human research programs that we don't
 

10669
02:48:56,880 --> 02:48:58,710
human research programs that we don't
have we don't even have those samples

10670
02:48:58,710 --> 02:48:58,720
have we don't even have those samples
 

10671
02:48:58,720 --> 02:49:00,389
have we don't even have those samples
bank that you would want to for the that

10672
02:49:00,389 --> 02:49:00,399
bank that you would want to for the that
 

10673
02:49:00,399 --> 02:49:01,590
bank that you would want to for the that
are old samples and we don't have any

10674
02:49:01,590 --> 02:49:01,600
are old samples and we don't have any
 

10675
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:03,190
are old samples and we don't have any
plans for missions like that right now

10676
02:49:03,190 --> 02:49:03,200
plans for missions like that right now
 

10677
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:04,309
plans for missions like that right now
so

10678
02:49:04,309 --> 02:49:04,319
so
 

10679
02:49:04,319 --> 02:49:05,830
so
uh we can't do it and that was the first

10680
02:49:05,830 --> 02:49:05,840
uh we can't do it and that was the first
 

10681

i felt like i was offering a really
 

10691
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:15,670
i felt like i was offering a really
unique research opportunity but then

10692
02:49:15,670 --> 02:49:15,680
unique research opportunity but then
 

10693
02:49:15,680 --> 02:49:17,510
unique research opportunity but then
that you know failure of saying that

10694
02:49:17,510 --> 02:49:17,520
that you know failure of saying that
 

10695
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,349
that you know failure of saying that
we're not ready yet it's not time but

10696
02:49:19,349 --> 02:49:19,359
we're not ready yet it's not time but
 

10697
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:20,630
we're not ready yet it's not time but
then once they have the solicitation

10698
02:49:20,630 --> 02:49:20,640
then once they have the solicitation
 

10699
02:49:20,640 --> 02:49:22,230
then once they have the solicitation
then he reached out and said oh actually

10700
02:49:22,230 --> 02:49:22,240
then he reached out and said oh actually
 

10701
02:49:22,240 --> 02:49:23,510
then he reached out and said oh actually
i think we've got something along the

10702
02:49:23,510 --> 02:49:23,520
i think we've got something along the
 

10703
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:24,630
i think we've got something along the
lines of what you were thinking a few

10704
02:49:24,630 --> 02:49:24,640
lines of what you were thinking a few
 

10705
02:49:24,640 --> 02:49:27,030
lines of what you were thinking a few
years ago so sometimes when some things

10706
02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:27,040
years ago so sometimes when some things
 

10707
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:28,630
years ago so sometimes when some things
get rejected or someone says no say okay

10708
02:49:28,630 --> 02:49:28,640
get rejected or someone says no say okay
 

10709
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:29,830
get rejected or someone says no say okay
maybe it's just too early but don't

10710
02:49:29,830 --> 02:49:29,840
maybe it's just too early but don't
 

10711
02:49:29,840 --> 02:49:31,750
maybe it's just too early but don't
don't give up i think and say

10712
02:49:31,750 --> 02:49:31,760
don't give up i think and say
 

10713
02:49:31,760 --> 02:49:33,910
don't give up i think and say
um you know so to me when someone says

10714
02:49:33,910 --> 02:49:33,920
um you know so to me when someone says
 

10715
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,349
um you know so to me when someone says
no not right now i'd be like okay i'll

10716
02:49:35,349 --> 02:49:35,359
no not right now i'd be like okay i'll
 

10717
02:49:35,359 --> 02:49:37,990
no not right now i'd be like okay i'll
just i'll come back in a year no just

10718
02:49:37,990 --> 02:49:38,000
just i'll come back in a year no just
 

10719
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,469
just i'll come back in a year no just
means no for now then so

10720
02:49:40,469 --> 02:49:40,479
means no for now then so
 

10721
02:49:40,479 --> 02:49:41,110
means no for now then so
if

10722
02:49:41,110 --> 02:49:41,120
if
 

10723
02:49:41,120 --> 02:49:42,790
if
i think sometimes no means you have a

10724
02:49:42,790 --> 02:49:42,800
i think sometimes no means you have a
 

10725
02:49:42,800 --> 02:49:44,550
i think sometimes no means you have a
crappy idea that is true they can i do

10726
02:49:44,550 --> 02:49:44,560
crappy idea that is true they can i do
 

10727
02:49:44,560 --> 02:49:46,070
crappy idea that is true they can i do
have crappy ideas and so does everybody

10728
02:49:46,070 --> 02:49:46,080
have crappy ideas and so does everybody
 

10729
02:49:46,080 --> 02:49:47,030
have crappy ideas and so does everybody
but

10730
02:49:47,030 --> 02:49:47,040
but
 

10731
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:48,389
but
if i really believe in it i just say

10732

10757
02:50:15,359 --> 02:50:16,870
i definitely i would even potentially do
a one-way trip to mars if it's later in

10758
02:50:16,870 --> 02:50:16,880
a one-way trip to mars if it's later in
 

10759
02:50:16,880 --> 02:50:17,750
a one-way trip to mars if it's later in
life

10760
02:50:17,750 --> 02:50:17,760
life
 

10761
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:18,790
life
so

10762
02:50:18,790 --> 02:50:18,800

think the
 

10771
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:29,750
think the
it may be that one-way trip if they

10772
02:50:29,750 --> 02:50:29,760
it may be that one-way trip if they
 

10773
02:50:29,760 --> 02:50:31,190
it may be that one-way trip if they
because i think they'll need settlers

10774
02:50:31,190 --> 02:50:31,200
because i think they'll need settlers
 

10775
02:50:31,200 --> 02:50:34,230
because i think they'll need settlers

um resilience experience
motivation

10792
02:50:51,910 --> 02:50:51,920

 

10793
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:54,309

would that make you sad to die in mars

10794
02:50:54,309 --> 02:50:54,319
would that make you sad to die in mars
 

10795
02:50:54,319 --> 02:50:56,469
would that make you sad to die in mars
looking back at the planet you were born

10796
02:50:56,469 --> 02:50:56,479
looking back at the planet you were born
 

10797
02:50:56,479 --> 02:50:59,269
looking back at the planet you were born
on no i think it would be actually

10798

on no i think it would be actually
 

10799
02:50:59,279 --> 02:51:00,950
on no i think it would be actually
in some ways maybe the best way to die

10800
02:51:00,950 --> 02:51:00,960
in some ways maybe the best way to die
 

10801
02:51:00,960 --> 02:51:02,630
in some ways maybe the best way to die
knowing that you're on the first wave of

knowing that you're on the first wave of
people

10804
02:51:03,510 --> 02:51:03,520
people
 

10805
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:05,990
people
expanding the reaching of the stars

10806
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,000
expanding the reaching of the stars
 

10807
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,269
expanding the reaching of the stars
it'd be an honor

10808
02:51:07,269 --> 02:51:07,279
it'd be an honor
 

10809
02:51:07,279 --> 02:51:08,790
it'd be an honor
why do you think we're here what's the

10810
02:51:08,790 --> 02:51:08,800
why do you think we're here what's the
 

10811
02:51:08,800 --> 02:51:10,309
why do you think we're here what's the
meaning of life

10812
02:51:10,309 --> 02:51:10,319
meaning of life
 

10813
02:51:10,319 --> 02:51:12,630
meaning of life
to serve as the guardians of life itself

10814
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:12,640
to serve as the guardians of life itself
 

10815
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:13,990
to serve as the guardians of life itself
that is a

10816
02:51:13,990 --> 02:51:14,000
that is a
 

10817
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,790
that is a
the the duty for our species is is to

10818
02:51:16,790 --> 02:51:16,800
the the duty for our species is is to
 

10819
02:51:16,800 --> 02:51:19,510
the the duty for our species is is to
recognize and really manifest this

10820
02:51:19,510 --> 02:51:19,520
recognize and really manifest this
 

10821
02:51:19,520 --> 02:51:21,269
recognize and really manifest this
unique responsibility that we have and

10822
02:51:21,269 --> 02:51:21,279
unique responsibility that we have and
 

10823
02:51:21,279 --> 02:51:23,110
unique responsibility that we have and
only we have so far

10824
02:51:23,110 --> 02:51:23,120
only we have so far
 

10825
02:51:23,120 --> 02:51:24,389
only we have so far
so i think

10826
02:51:24,389 --> 02:51:24,399
so i think
 

10827
02:51:24,399 --> 02:51:26,070
so i think
yeah to me the

10828
02:51:26,070 --> 02:51:26,080
yeah to me the
 

10829
02:51:26,080 --> 02:51:28,550
yeah to me the
the meaning of life is for life to it in

10830
02:51:28,550 --> 02:51:28,560
the meaning of life is for life to it in
 

10831
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:29,830
the meaning of life is for life to it in
its simplest form is to be able to

10832
02:51:29,830 --> 02:51:29,840
its simplest form is to be able to
 

10833
02:51:29,840 --> 02:51:32,550
its simplest form is to be able to
survive but to

10834
02:51:32,550 --> 02:51:32,560
survive but to
 

10835
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:35,110
survive but to
leverage the frailty of life into its

10836
02:51:35,110 --> 02:51:35,120
leverage the frailty of life into its
 

10837
02:51:35,120 --> 02:51:37,269
leverage the frailty of life into its
ability to protect itself and

10838
02:51:37,269 --> 02:51:37,279
ability to protect itself and
 

10839
02:51:37,279 --> 02:51:38,309
ability to protect itself and
quite literally the guardians of the

10840
02:51:38,309 --> 02:51:38,319
quite literally the guardians of the
 

10841
02:51:38,319 --> 02:51:39,910
quite literally the guardians of the
galaxy is basically what we are

10842
02:51:39,910 --> 02:51:39,920
galaxy is basically what we are
 

10843
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:41,429
galaxy is basically what we are
regarding light regarding ourselves and

10844
02:51:41,429 --> 02:51:41,439
regarding light regarding ourselves and
 

10845
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:42,550
regarding light regarding ourselves and
also life

10846
02:51:42,550 --> 02:51:42,560
also life
 

10847
02:51:42,560 --> 02:51:44,389
also life
i mean life is just so precious as far

10848
02:51:44,389 --> 02:51:44,399
i mean life is just so precious as far
 

10849
02:51:44,399 --> 02:51:46,309
i mean life is just so precious as far
as we know it is completely rare in the

10850
02:51:46,309 --> 02:51:46,319
as we know it is completely rare in the
 

10851
02:51:46,319 --> 02:51:47,349
as we know it is completely rare in the
universe

10852
02:51:47,349 --> 02:51:47,359
universe
 

10853
02:51:47,359 --> 02:51:48,950
universe
and i do think a lot well what if it

10854
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:48,960
and i do think a lot well what if it
 

10855
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:50,389
and i do think a lot well what if it
what if this is the only universe that's

10856
02:51:50,389 --> 02:51:50,399
what if this is the only universe that's
 

10857
02:51:50,399 --> 02:51:51,670
what if this is the only universe that's
ever come in and it won't come back

10858
02:51:51,670 --> 02:51:51,680
ever come in and it won't come back
 

10859
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:52,550
ever come in and it won't come back
again

10860
02:51:52,550 --> 02:51:52,560
again
 

10861
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:54,150
again
and like this is it

10862
02:51:54,150 --> 02:51:54,160
and like this is it
 

10863
02:51:54,160 --> 02:51:56,790
and like this is it
and if that's true we have to serve as

10864
02:51:56,790 --> 02:51:56,800
and if that's true we have to serve as
 

10865
02:51:56,800 --> 02:51:57,910
and if that's true we have to serve as
shepherds

10866
02:51:57,910 --> 02:51:57,920
shepherds
 

10867
02:51:57,920 --> 02:52:01,030
shepherds
leverage the frailty of life

10868
02:52:01,030 --> 02:52:01,040
leverage the frailty of life
 

10869
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:03,830
leverage the frailty of life
to protect it and this is all life so we

10870
02:52:03,830 --> 02:52:03,840
to protect it and this is all life so we
 

10871
02:52:03,840 --> 02:52:05,590
to protect it and this is all life so we
get the opportunity we humans get the

10872
02:52:05,590 --> 02:52:05,600
get the opportunity we humans get the
 

10873
02:52:05,600 --> 02:52:07,910
get the opportunity we humans get the
opportunity to be smart enough to be

10874
02:52:07,910 --> 02:52:07,920
opportunity to be smart enough to be
 

10875
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:09,750
opportunity to be smart enough to be
clever enough to be motivated enough to

10876
02:52:09,750 --> 02:52:09,760
clever enough to be motivated enough to
 

10877
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:11,190
clever enough to be motivated enough to
actually protect the other life that's

10878
02:52:11,190 --> 02:52:11,200
actually protect the other life that's
 

10879
02:52:11,200 --> 02:52:13,030
actually protect the other life that's
on this including ai including life

10880
02:52:13,030 --> 02:52:13,040
on this including ai including life
 

10881
02:52:13,040 --> 02:52:14,150
on this including ai including life
that's to come that might be very

10882
02:52:14,150 --> 02:52:14,160
that's to come that might be very
 

10883
02:52:14,160 --> 02:52:15,830
that's to come that might be very
different from what we imagined today

10884
02:52:15,830 --> 02:52:15,840
different from what we imagined today
 

10885
02:52:15,840 --> 02:52:17,269
different from what we imagined today
and that would make you sad if we were

10886
02:52:17,269 --> 02:52:17,279
and that would make you sad if we were
 

10887
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:20,150
and that would make you sad if we were
replaced by the kind and uh the kind or

10888
02:52:20,150 --> 02:52:20,160
replaced by the kind and uh the kind or
 

10889

02:52:22,309 --> 02:52:22,319
smarter ai no i think about that in the
 

10891
02:52:22,319 --> 02:52:24,389
smarter ai no i think about that in the
book a bit of that i think i i would be

10892
02:52:24,389 --> 02:52:24,399
book a bit of that i think i i would be
 

10893
02:52:24,399 --> 02:52:27,269
book a bit of that i think i i would be
okay with it if they carry some echo of

10894
02:52:27,269 --> 02:52:27,279
okay with it if they carry some echo of
 

10895
02:52:27,279 --> 02:52:29,670
okay with it if they carry some echo of
that duty and they bring that with them

10896
02:52:29,670 --> 02:52:29,680
that duty and they bring that with them
 

10897
02:52:29,680 --> 02:52:31,269
that duty and they bring that with them
uh it would be real i'd be sad if they

10898
02:52:31,269 --> 02:52:31,279
uh it would be real i'd be sad if they
 

10899
02:52:31,279 --> 02:52:32,710
uh it would be real i'd be sad if they
like to hell with everyone we're gonna

10900
02:52:32,710 --> 02:52:32,720
like to hell with everyone we're gonna
 

10901
02:52:32,720 --> 02:52:34,790
like to hell with everyone we're gonna
destroy everything we come across and

10902
02:52:34,790 --> 02:52:34,800
destroy everything we come across and
 

10903
02:52:34,800 --> 02:52:36,230

become like nanobots that make

10904
02:52:36,230 --> 02:52:36,240
become like nanobots that make
 

10905
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:37,990
become like nanobots that make
everything gray goo

10906
02:52:37,990 --> 02:52:38,000
everything gray goo
 

10907
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,510
everything gray goo
that seems but that would still be a

10908
02:52:39,510 --> 02:52:39,520
that seems but that would still be a
 

10909
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:41,750
that seems but that would still be a
version of life just not one

10910
02:52:41,750 --> 02:52:41,760
version of life just not one
 

10911
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:44,469
version of life just not one
that is as i think is pretty but

10912
02:52:44,469 --> 02:52:44,479
that is as i think is pretty but
 

10913
02:52:44,479 --> 02:52:46,230
that is as i think is pretty but
technically it'd be alive so like you

10914
02:52:46,230 --> 02:52:46,240
technically it'd be alive so like you
 

10915
02:52:46,240 --> 02:52:48,790
technically it'd be alive so like you
know philosophically could i object uh

10916
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:48,800
know philosophically could i object uh
 

10917
02:52:48,800 --> 02:52:50,230
know philosophically could i object uh
it's borderline

10918
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:50,240
it's borderline
 

10919
02:52:50,240 --> 02:52:52,710
it's borderline
yeah but romantically no romantic

10920
02:52:52,710 --> 02:52:52,720
yeah but romantically no romantic
 

10921
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:54,309
yeah but romantically no romantic
there's they need to carry the duty

10922
02:52:54,309 --> 02:52:54,319
there's they need to carry the duty
 

10923
02:52:54,319 --> 02:52:56,389
there's they need to carry the duty
there's some yes yeah there's a bit of a

10924
02:52:56,389 --> 02:52:56,399
there's some yes yeah there's a bit of a
 

10925
02:52:56,399 --> 02:52:58,230
there's some yes yeah there's a bit of a
romance to the philosophy it's in there

10926
02:52:58,230 --> 02:52:58,240
romance to the philosophy it's in there
 

10927
02:52:58,240 --> 02:53:00,150
romance to the philosophy it's in there
and you also

10928
02:53:00,150 --> 02:53:00,160
and you also
 

10929
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:02,710
and you also
uh end the book with a universe that

10930
02:53:02,710 --> 02:53:02,720
uh end the book with a universe that
 

10931
02:53:02,720 --> 02:53:05,030
uh end the book with a universe that
creates new

10932
02:53:05,030 --> 02:53:05,040
creates new
 

10933
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:06,710
creates new
universes

10934
02:53:06,710 --> 02:53:06,720
universes
 

10935
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:09,030
universes
uh

10936
02:53:09,030 --> 02:53:09,040

 

10937
02:53:09,040 --> 02:53:11,510

so if this isn't the only universe do

10938
02:53:11,510 --> 02:53:11,520
so if this isn't the only universe do
 

10939
02:53:11,520 --> 02:53:13,349
so if this isn't the only universe do
you think that's in our future

10940
02:53:13,349 --> 02:53:13,359
you think that's in our future
 

10941
02:53:13,359 --> 02:53:14,950
you think that's in our future
that we might launch

10942
02:53:14,950 --> 02:53:14,960
that we might launch
 

10943
02:53:14,960 --> 02:53:17,030
that we might launch
new universe new offspring universes

10944
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:17,040
new universe new offspring universes
 

10945
02:53:17,040 --> 02:53:18,790
new universe new offspring universes
it's very possible i mean multiverse is

10946
02:53:18,790 --> 02:53:18,800
it's very possible i mean multiverse is
 

10947
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:20,950
it's very possible i mean multiverse is
a controversial field because it's very

10948
02:53:20,950 --> 02:53:20,960
a controversial field because it's very
 

10949
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:24,150
a controversial field because it's very
much hypothetical but

10950
02:53:24,150 --> 02:53:24,160
much hypothetical but
 

10951
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:25,910
much hypothetical but
with this universe has been created the

10952
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:25,920
with this universe has been created the
 

10953
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:27,750
with this universe has been created the
one we're in now and so it's happened

10954
02:53:27,750 --> 02:53:27,760
one we're in now and so it's happened
 

10955
02:53:27,760 --> 02:53:29,750
one we're in now and so it's happened
before it certainly could happen again

10956
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:29,760
before it certainly could happen again
 

10957
02:53:29,760 --> 02:53:30,790
before it certainly could happen again
some of them might be happening in

10958
02:53:30,790 --> 02:53:30,800
some of them might be happening in
 

10959
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:32,790
some of them might be happening in
parallel i i think you know if you look

10960
02:53:32,790 --> 02:53:32,800
parallel i i think you know if you look
 

10961
02:53:32,800 --> 02:53:34,230
parallel i i think you know if you look
out billions of years trillions of years

10962
02:53:34,230 --> 02:53:34,240
out billions of years trillions of years
 

10963
02:53:34,240 --> 02:53:35,510
out billions of years trillions of years
in the future of technological

10964
02:53:35,510 --> 02:53:35,520
in the future of technological

development
 

10967
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:38,469

certainly possible we could start to

10968
02:53:38,469 --> 02:53:38,479
certainly possible we could start to
 

10969
02:53:38,479 --> 02:53:40,230
