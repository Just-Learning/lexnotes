00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,040
based based computers and that sort of
 

167
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,630
based based computers and that sort of
brought me to Quantum Computing as a a

168
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:05,640
brought me to Quantum Computing as a a
 

169
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,069
brought me to Quantum Computing as a a
field of study to uh first of all

170
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:09,079
field of study to uh first of all
 

171
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,509
field of study to uh first of all
simulate nature and in my work it was to

172
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:12,519
simulate nature and in my work it was to
 

173
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,309
simulate nature and in my work it was to
learn representations of nature that can

174
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:15,319
learn representations of nature that can
 

175
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,469
learn representations of nature that can
run on such computers so if you have ai

176
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
run on such computers so if you have ai
 

177
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,510
run on such computers so if you have ai
representations that think like nature

178
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:24,520
representations that think like nature
 

179
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,950
representations that think like nature
um then they'll be able to more

180
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
um then they'll be able to more
 

181
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,110
um then they'll be able to more
accurately represent it at least that

182
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
accurately represent it at least that
 

183
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,150
accurately represent it at least that
was the the thesis that that brought me

184
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
was the the thesis that that brought me
 

185
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,830
was the the thesis that that brought me
to be an early player in the field

186
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:34,840
to be an early player in the field
 

187
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,070
to be an early player in the field
called Quantum machine learning right so

188
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,080
called Quantum machine learning right so
 

189
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,150
called Quantum machine learning right so
how to do machine learning on on quantum

190
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
how to do machine learning on on quantum
 

191
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,790
how to do machine learning on on quantum
computers um and really sort of extend

192
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
computers um and really sort of extend
 

193
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,070
computers um and really sort of extend
uh Notions of intelligence to to the

194
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,080
uh Notions of intelligence to to the
 

195
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,870
uh Notions of intelligence to to the
quantum realm so how do you capture uh

196
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
quantum realm so how do you capture uh
 

197
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,870
quantum realm so how do you capture uh
and understand quantum mechanical data

198
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
and understand quantum mechanical data
 

199
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,550
and understand quantum mechanical data
from our world right and how do you

200
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
from our world right and how do you
 

201
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,670
from our world right and how do you
learn quantum mechanical representations

202
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
learn quantum mechanical representations
 

203
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,270
learn quantum mechanical representations
of our world on what kind of computer do

204
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
of our world on what kind of computer do
 

205
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,629
of our world on what kind of computer do
you run these representations and train

206
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:03,639
you run these representations and train
 

207
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,150
you run these representations and train
them how do you do so and so that's

208
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
them how do you do so and so that's
 

209
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,350
them how do you do so and so that's
really sort of the questions I was

210
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,360
really sort of the questions I was
 

211
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,950
really sort of the questions I was
looking to answer because ultimately I

212
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
looking to answer because ultimately I
 

213
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,310
looking to answer because ultimately I
had a a sort of crisis of Faith uh

214
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
had a a sort of crisis of Faith uh
 

215
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,310
had a a sort of crisis of Faith uh
originally I wanted to figure out you

216
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:17,320
originally I wanted to figure out you
 

217
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,469
originally I wanted to figure out you
know as every physicist does at the

218
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:19,479
know as every physicist does at the
 

219
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,150
know as every physicist does at the
beginning of their career a few

220
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,160
beginning of their career a few
 

221
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,870
beginning of their career a few
equations that describe the whole

222
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
equations that describe the whole
 

223
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,870
equations that describe the whole
universe right and and sort of be the

224
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:25,880
universe right and and sort of be the
 

225
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,350
universe right and and sort of be the
the hero of the story there um but

226
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:28,360
the hero of the story there um but
 

227
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,029
the hero of the story there um but
eventually I realized that

228
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
eventually I realized that
 

229
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,469
eventually I realized that
augmenting ourselves with machines

230
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:33,479
augmenting ourselves with machines
 

231
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,830
augmenting ourselves with machines
augmenting our ability to perceive

232
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
augmenting our ability to perceive
 

233
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,110
augmenting our ability to perceive
predict and control our world with

234
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
predict and control our world with
 

235
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,230
predict and control our world with
machines is the path forward right and

236
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
machines is the path forward right and
 

237
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,990
machines is the path forward right and
that's what got me to leave theoretical

238
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
that's what got me to leave theoretical
 

239
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,550
that's what got me to leave theoretical
physics and go into Quantum Computing

240
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
physics and go into Quantum Computing
 

241
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,749
physics and go into Quantum Computing
and Quantum machine learning and during

242
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
and Quantum machine learning and during
 

243
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,590
and Quantum machine learning and during
those years I thought that there was

244
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
those years I thought that there was
 

245
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,990
those years I thought that there was
still a piece missing there was a piece

246
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,000
still a piece missing there was a piece
 

247
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,270
still a piece missing there was a piece
of our understanding of the world and

248
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
of our understanding of the world and
 

249
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,469
of our understanding of the world and
our our way to compute and our way to

250
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
our our way to compute and our way to
 

251
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,390
our our way to compute and our way to
think about the world and if you look at

252
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:03,400
think about the world and if you look at
 

253
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,629
think about the world and if you look at
the physical scales right at the very

254
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
the physical scales right at the very
 

255
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,629
the physical scales right at the very
small scales things are quantum

256
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:09,639
small scales things are quantum
 

257
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,909
small scales things are quantum
mechanical right and at the very large

258
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:12,919
mechanical right and at the very large
 

259
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:15,430
mechanical right and at the very large
scales things are deterministic things

260
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
scales things are deterministic things
 

261
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,110
scales things are deterministic things
have averaged out right I'm definitely

262
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
have averaged out right I'm definitely
 

263
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,950
have averaged out right I'm definitely
here in this seat I'm not in a super

264
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
here in this seat I'm not in a super
 

265
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,390
here in this seat I'm not in a super
position over over here and there at the

266
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:21,400
position over over here and there at the
 

267
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,029
position over over here and there at the
very small scales things are in superp

268
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
very small scales things are in superp
 

269
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,510
very small scales things are in superp
position they can uh exhibit uh

270
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520
position they can uh exhibit uh
 

271
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,150
position they can uh exhibit uh
interference uh effects um but at the

272
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
interference uh effects um but at the
 

273
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,110
interference uh effects um but at the
mesoscales right the scales that matter

274
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
mesoscales right the scales that matter
 

275
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,110
mesoscales right the scales that matter
for day-to-day life you know the scales

276
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
for day-to-day life you know the scales
 

277
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,629
for day-to-day life you know the scales
of proteins of biology of gases liquids

278
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:39,639
of proteins of biology of gases liquids
 

279
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,670
of proteins of biology of gases liquids
and so on uh things are actually uh

280
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
and so on uh things are actually uh
 

281
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,990
and so on uh things are actually uh
thermodynamical right they're

282
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
thermodynamical right they're
 

283
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,469
thermodynamical right they're
fluctuating and after I guess about

284
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
fluctuating and after I guess about
 

285
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,629
fluctuating and after I guess about
eight years in in Quantum Computing and

286
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
eight years in in Quantum Computing and
 

287
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,150
eight years in in Quantum Computing and
Quantum machine learning I had a

288
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,160
Quantum machine learning I had a
 

289
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,469
Quantum machine learning I had a
realization that you know I was I was

290
00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:57,479
realization that you know I was I was
 

291
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,309
realization that you know I was I was
looking for answers uh about our

292
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
looking for answers uh about our
 

293
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,510
looking for answers uh about our
universe by studying the very big and

294
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,520
universe by studying the very big and
 

295
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,270
universe by studying the very big and
the very small right I was I did a bit

296
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
the very small right I was I did a bit
 

297
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,110
the very small right I was I did a bit
of quantum cosmology so that's studying

298
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,120
of quantum cosmology so that's studying
 

299
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,189
of quantum cosmology so that's studying
the cosmos where it's going where it

300
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:10,199
the cosmos where it's going where it
 

301
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,110
the cosmos where it's going where it
came from you study black hole physics

302
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
came from you study black hole physics
 

303
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,830
came from you study black hole physics
you study the Extremes in quantum

304
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:14,840
you study the Extremes in quantum
 

305
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,110
you study the Extremes in quantum
gravity you study where the energy

306
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,120
gravity you study where the energy
 

307
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,909
gravity you study where the energy
density is sufficient for both quantum

308
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:20,919
density is sufficient for both quantum
 

309
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,350
density is sufficient for both quantum
mechanics and gravity to be relevant

310
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
mechanics and gravity to be relevant
 

311
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,230
mechanics and gravity to be relevant
right and the sort of extreme scenarios

312
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,240
right and the sort of extreme scenarios
 

313
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,629
right and the sort of extreme scenarios
are black holes and you know the very

314
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:29,639
are black holes and you know the very
 

315
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,909
are black holes and you know the very
early Universe And so there's the sort

316
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
early Universe And so there's the sort
 

317
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,830
early Universe And so there's the sort
of scenarios that you you study the

318
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:34,840
of scenarios that you you study the
 

319
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,589
of scenarios that you you study the
interface between uh uh quantum

320
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
interface between uh uh quantum
 

321
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,990
interface between uh uh quantum
mechanics and and

322
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
mechanics and and
 

323
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,189
mechanics and and
relativity um and you know really I was

324
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
relativity um and you know really I was
 

325
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,070
relativity um and you know really I was
studying these extremes

326
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,080

is fundamental to life and and and you
 

491
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,590
is fundamental to life and and and you
see this in in the equations actually of

492
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:48,600
see this in in the equations actually of
 

493
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,269
see this in in the equations actually of
equilibrium

494
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:50,279
equilibrium
 

495
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,710

thermodynamics you see that

496
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:53,720
thermodynamics you see that
 

497
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,430
thermodynamics you see that
paths uh of trajectories of

498
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,440
paths uh of trajectories of
 

499
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,870
paths uh of trajectories of
configurations of matter that are better

500
00:11:59,870 --> 00:11:59,880
configurations of matter that are better
 

501
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,550
configurations of matter that are better
at acquiring free energy and dissipating

502
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:03,560
at acquiring free energy and dissipating
 

503
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,350
at acquiring free energy and dissipating
more heat are uh exponentially more

504
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
more heat are uh exponentially more
 

505
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,350
more heat are uh exponentially more
likely right so the universe is biased

506
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
likely right so the universe is biased
 

507
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,750
likely right so the universe is biased
towards certain

508
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:12,760
towards certain
 

509
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,269
towards certain
Futures and so there's a

510
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
Futures and so there's a
 

511
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,310
Futures and so there's a
natural uh Direction where the whole

512
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:19,320
natural uh Direction where the whole
 

513
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,550
natural uh Direction where the whole
system wants to go so the second law

514
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
system wants to go so the second law
 

515
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,430
system wants to go so the second law
thermodynamic says that the entropy

516
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
thermodynamic says that the entropy
 

517
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,150
thermodynamic says that the entropy
always is increasing the universe it's

518
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,160
always is increasing the universe it's
 

519
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,110
always is increasing the universe it's
tending towards equilibrium and you're

520
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:29,120
tending towards equilibrium and you're
 

521
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,910
tending towards equilibrium and you're
saying there's these Pockets that have

522
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:32,920
saying there's these Pockets that have
 

523
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,470
saying there's these Pockets that have
complexity and are out of equilibrium

524
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
complexity and are out of equilibrium
 

525
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,150
complexity and are out of equilibrium
you said that thermodynamics favors the

526
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
you said that thermodynamics favors the
 

527
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,069
you said that thermodynamics favors the
creation of complex life that increases

528
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
creation of complex life that increases
 

529
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,430
creation of complex life that increases
its capability to use energy to offload

530
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:42,440
its capability to use energy to offload
 

531
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,870
its capability to use energy to offload
entropy to offload entropy so you have

532
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
entropy to offload entropy so you have
 

533
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,629
entropy to offload entropy so you have
pockets of non- entropy that tend the

534
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:47,639
pockets of non- entropy that tend the
 

535
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,990
pockets of non- entropy that tend the
opposite direction mhm why is that

536
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
opposite direction mhm why is that
 

537
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,030
opposite direction mhm why is that
intuitive to you that it's natural for

538
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,040
intuitive to you that it's natural for
 

539
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,350
intuitive to you that it's natural for
such Pockets to emerge well we're far

540
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:55,360
such Pockets to emerge well we're far
 

541
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,269
such Pockets to emerge well we're far
more efficient at producing heat than

542
00:12:59,269 --> 00:12:59,279
more efficient at producing heat than
 

543
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,030
more efficient at producing heat than
let's say just a rock with a similar

544
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,040
let's say just a rock with a similar
 

545
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,750
let's say just a rock with a similar
mass as ourselves right we acquire you

546
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
mass as ourselves right we acquire you
 

547
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,670
mass as ourselves right we acquire you
know free energy you know we acquire

548
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
know free energy you know we acquire
 

549
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,870
know free energy you know we acquire
food and we're using all this

550
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
food and we're using all this
 

551
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,470
food and we're using all this
electricity uh uh for our operation and

552
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
electricity uh uh for our operation and
 

553
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,430
electricity uh uh for our operation and
so the universe wants to produce more

554
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
so the universe wants to produce more
 

555
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,310
so the universe wants to produce more
entropy and by having life uh go on and

556
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
entropy and by having life uh go on and
 

557
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,350
entropy and by having life uh go on and
grow uh it's actually more optimal at

558
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
grow uh it's actually more optimal at
 

559
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,350
grow uh it's actually more optimal at
producing entropy because it will seek

560
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
producing entropy because it will seek
 

561
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,310
producing entropy because it will seek
out pockets of free energy uh and and

562
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:31,320
out pockets of free energy uh and and
 

563
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,509
out pockets of free energy uh and and
burn it for its sustenance and further

564
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:34,519
burn it for its sustenance and further
 

565
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,350
burn it for its sustenance and further
growth and uh you know that's sort of

566
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360
growth and uh you know that's sort of
 

567
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,550

00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
know life emerged because of this uh
 

577
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,629

sort of property and and to me this

578
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:55,639
sort of property and and to me this
 

579
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:58,389
sort of property and and to me this
physics is what governs the mesoscales

580
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
physics is what governs the mesoscales
 

581
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,150
physics is what governs the mesoscales
and so it's it's the missing piece

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,389
general and pessimism about tech and
that pessimism was sort of virally

00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,189
mindset because it is hypatius which
means that if you believe it you're

652
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:46,199
means that if you believe it you're
 

653
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,550
means that if you believe it you're
increasing the likelihood of it

654
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:48,560
increasing the likelihood of it
 

655
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,189
increasing the likelihood of it
happening and so felt a responsibility

656
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:52,199
happening and so felt a responsibility
 

657
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,189
happening and so felt a responsibility
to some extent

658
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:54,199
to some extent
 

659
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,189
to some extent
to um make people aware of the

660
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
to um make people aware of the
 

661
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,269
to um make people aware of the
trajectory of civilization and the

662
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:01,279
trajectory of civilization and the
 

663
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,389
trajectory of civilization and the
natural tendency of the system to adapt

664
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:03,399
natural tendency of the system to adapt
 

665
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,949
natural tendency of the system to adapt
towards its growth and sort of that

666
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:05,959
towards its growth and sort of that
 

667
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,470
towards its growth and sort of that
actually the laws of physics say that

668
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:07,480
actually the laws of physics say that
 

669
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,629
actually the laws of physics say that
the future is going to be better and

670
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:09,639
the future is going to be better and
 

671
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,790
the future is going to be better and
grander statistically and we we can make

672
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
grander statistically and we we can make
 

673
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,509
grander statistically and we we can make
it so and if you believe in it if you

674
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
it so and if you believe in it if you
 

675
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,590
it so and if you believe in it if you
believe that the future will be better

676
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
believe that the future will be better
 

677
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,590
believe that the future will be better
and you believe you have agency to make

678
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
and you believe you have agency to make
 

679
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,309
and you believe you have agency to make
it happen you're actually increasing the

680
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:24,319
it happen you're actually increasing the
 

681
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,790
it happen you're actually increasing the
likelihood of that better future

682
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:25,800
likelihood of that better future
 

683
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,269
likelihood of that better future
happening and so I sort of felt the

684
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
happening and so I sort of felt the
 

685
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,590
happening and so I sort of felt the
responsibility to sort of engineer a

686
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:32,600
responsibility to sort of engineer a
 

687
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,949
responsibility to sort of engineer a
movement of viral optimism about the

688
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:35,959
movement of viral optimism about the
 

689
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,749
movement of viral optimism about the
future and build a community of people

690
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:39,759
future and build a community of people
 

691
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,309
future and build a community of people
supporting each other to build and do

692
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:42,319
supporting each other to build and do
 

693
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,189
supporting each other to build and do
hard things do the things that need to

694
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:44,199
hard things do the things that need to
 

695
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:48,550
hard things do the things that need to
be done for us to to scale up

696
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
be done for us to to scale up
 

697
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,350
be done for us to to scale up
civilization um because at least to me I

698
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
civilization um because at least to me I
 

699
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,069
civilization um because at least to me I
don't think stagnation or slowing down

700
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
don't think stagnation or slowing down
 

701
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,829
don't think stagnation or slowing down
is actually an option fundamentally life

702
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
is actually an option fundamentally life
 

703
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,590
is actually an option fundamentally life
and and the whole whole system our whole

704
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
and and the whole whole system our whole
 

705
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,590
and and the whole whole system our whole
civilization wants to

706
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
civilization wants to
 

707
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,590
civilization wants to
grow and there's just far more

708
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:04,600
grow and there's just far more
 

709
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,510
grow and there's just far more
cooperation when the system is growing

710
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
cooperation when the system is growing
 

711
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,630
cooperation when the system is growing
rather than when it's declining and you

712
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:10,640
rather than when it's declining and you
 

713
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,630
rather than when it's declining and you
have to decide how to split the

714
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:13,640
have to decide how to split the
 

715
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,549
have to decide how to split the
pie and so I've balanced uh both

716
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:17,559
pie and so I've balanced uh both
 

717
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:21,069
pie and so I've balanced uh both
identities so far um but I guess

718
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,079
identities so far um but I guess
 

719
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,590
identities so far um but I guess
recently uh the two have been merged

720
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:24,600
recently uh the two have been merged
 

721
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,949
recently uh the two have been merged
more or less without my consent so you

722
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:27,959
more or less without my consent so you
 

723
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,230
more or less without my consent so you
said a lot lot of really interesting

724
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:29,240
said a lot lot of really interesting
 

725
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,110
said a lot lot of really interesting
things there so

726
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
things there so
 

727
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,390
things there so
first representations of nature that's

728
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
first representations of nature that's
 

729
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,590
first representations of nature that's
something that first Drew you in to try

730
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:36,600
something that first Drew you in to try
 

731
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,870
something that first Drew you in to try
to understand from a Quantum Computing

732
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:38,880
to understand from a Quantum Computing
 

733
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,110
to understand from a Quantum Computing
perspectives like how do you understand

734
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
perspectives like how do you understand
 

735
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,150
perspectives like how do you understand
nature how do you represent nature in

736
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:43,160
nature how do you represent nature in
 

737
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,590
nature how do you represent nature in
order to understand it in order to

738
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:44,600
order to understand it in order to
 

739
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,390
order to understand it in order to
simulate it in order to do something

740
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
simulate it in order to do something
 

741
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,510
simulate it in order to do something
with it so it's a question of

742
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:48,520
with it so it's a question of
 

743
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,230
with it so it's a question of
representations and then there's that

744
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
representations and then there's that
 

745
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,510
representations and then there's that
leap you take from the quantum

746
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:52,520
leap you take from the quantum
 

747
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,630
leap you take from the quantum
mechanical representation to the uh what

748
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:54,640
mechanical representation to the uh what
 

749
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,789
mechanical representation to the uh what
you're calling mesle scale

750
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:55,799
you're calling mesle scale
 

751
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,669
you're calling mesle scale
representation where the thermodynamics

752
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
representation where the thermodynamics
 

753
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,350
representation where the thermodynamics
comes into play which is a way to

754
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:00,360
comes into play which is a way to
 

755
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,470
comes into play which is a way to
represent nature in order to understand

756
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
represent nature in order to understand
 

757
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,830
represent nature in order to understand
what life uh human behavior all this

758
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:06,840
what life uh human behavior all this
 

759
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,070
what life uh human behavior all this
kind of stuff that's happening here on

760
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,080
kind of stuff that's happening here on
 

761
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,990
kind of stuff that's happening here on
Earth that's seems interesting to us

762
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,000
Earth that's seems interesting to us
 

763
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,070
Earth that's seems interesting to us
then there's uh the word

764
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
then there's uh the word
 

765
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,549
then there's uh the word
hypers so some ideas as oppos both

766
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:17,559
hypers so some ideas as oppos both
 

767
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,390
hypers so some ideas as oppos both
pessimism and optimism of such ideas

768
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
pessimism and optimism of such ideas
 

769
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,630
pessimism and optimism of such ideas
that if you internalize them you in part

770
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
that if you internalize them you in part
 

771
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,029
that if you internalize them you in part
make that idea a reality so both

772
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
make that idea a reality so both
 

773
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,630
make that idea a reality so both
optimism and pessimism have the that

774
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
optimism and pessimism have the that
 

775
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,350
optimism and pessimism have the that
property I would say that probably a lot

776
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:30,360
property I would say that probably a lot
 

777
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,430
property I would say that probably a lot
of ideas have that property which is one

778
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
of ideas have that property which is one
 

779
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,909
of ideas have that property which is one
of the interesting things about humans

780
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
of the interesting things about humans
 

781
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,630
of the interesting things about humans
and uh you talked about one interesting

782
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:39,640
and uh you talked about one interesting
 

783
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,190
and uh you talked about one interesting
difference also between the sort of uh

799
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,669
communicate in the 21st century also the
movement that you mentioned that you

800
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:04,679
movement that you mentioned that you
 

801
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,590
movement that you mentioned that you
started it's not just the meme account

802
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:06,600
started it's not just the meme account
 

803
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,230
started it's not just the meme account
but there's also a a name to it called

804
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,240
but there's also a a name to it called
 

805
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,750
but there's also a a name to it called
effective accelerationism

806
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:12,760
effective accelerationism
 

807
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,470
effective accelerationism
e a play a

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:15,480
e a play a
 

809
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,950
e a play a
resistance to the effective altruism

811
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,870
resistance to the effective altruism
movement also an interesting one that

812
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:20,880

that doxing was illegal right um but
there's this weird threshold when it

978
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:15,279

979
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:17,990
there's this weird threshold when it
becomes of public interest to know

980
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
becomes of public interest to know
 

981

becomes of public interest to know
someone's identity and those were the

because I had just reached 50k followers

988
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:27,039

because I had just reached 50k followers
allegedly that's of public interest and

990
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:29,799

allegedly that's of public interest and
so where where do we draw the line when

992
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:32,200
so where where do we draw the line when
 

993

so where where do we draw the line when
is it legal to to dock someone the word

the right to point that out um and just
have the ideas that we put out evaluated

like New Game Plus in a video game you

1096
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:16,840
like New Game Plus in a video game you
 

1097
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,149
like New Game Plus in a video game you
restart the video game with your

1098
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
restart the video game with your
 

1099
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,950
restart the video game with your
knowledge of how to beat it maybe some

1100
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:19,960
knowledge of how to beat it maybe some
 

1101
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,190
knowledge of how to beat it maybe some
tools but you restart the video game

1102
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,200
tools but you restart the video game
 

1103
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,310
tools but you restart the video game
from scratch right and um I think to

1104
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,320
from scratch right and um I think to
 

1105
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,350
from scratch right and um I think to
have a truly efficient

1106
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:28,360
have a truly efficient
 

1107
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,470
have a truly efficient
Marketplace of ideas where we can

1108
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:30,480
Marketplace of ideas where we can
 

1109
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,990
Marketplace of ideas where we can
evaluate

1110
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
evaluate
 

1111
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,549
evaluate
ideas however off the beaten path they

1112
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:34,559
ideas however off the beaten path they
 

1113
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,510
ideas however off the beaten path they
are we need the freedom of expression

1114
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:37,520
are we need the freedom of expression
 

1115
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,590
are we need the freedom of expression
and I think that anonymity um and

1116
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
and I think that anonymity um and
 

1117
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,590
and I think that anonymity um and
pseudonyms are very crucial to having

1118
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:44,600
pseudonyms are very crucial to having
 

1119
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,909
pseudonyms are very crucial to having
that efficient Marketplace of ideas for

1120
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:46,919
that efficient Marketplace of ideas for
 

1121
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,110
that efficient Marketplace of ideas for
us to

1122
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:48,120
us to
 

1123
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,549
us to
find the the Optima of all sorts of ways

1124
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
find the the Optima of all sorts of ways
 

1125
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,350
find the the Optima of all sorts of ways
to organize ourselves if we can't

1126
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:54,360
to organize ourselves if we can't
 

1127
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,750
to organize ourselves if we can't
discuss things how are we going to

1128
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
discuss things how are we going to
 

1129
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,149
discuss things how are we going to

so it was it was disappointing to hear

1132
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:00,399
so it was it was disappointing to hear
 

1133
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:02,389
so it was it was disappointing to hear
that I was getting doxed and I wanted to

1134
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:02,399
that I was getting doxed and I wanted to
 

1135
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:04,470
that I was getting doxed and I wanted to
get in front of it um because I had a

1136
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:04,480
get in front of it um because I had a
 

1137
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,990
get in front of it um because I had a
responsibility for for for my company um

1138
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
responsibility for for for my company um
 

1139
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,269
responsibility for for for my company um
and so I you know we ended up

1140
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:10,279
and so I you know we ended up
 

1141
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,190
and so I you know we ended up
disclosing uh that we're running a

1142
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,200
disclosing uh that we're running a
 

1143
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,310
disclosing uh that we're running a
company some of the leadership um and uh

1144
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:17,320
company some of the leadership um and uh
 

1145
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,630
company some of the leadership um and uh
essentially yeah uh I I told the world

1146
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:19,640
essentially yeah uh I I told the world
 

1147
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,789
essentially yeah uh I I told the world
that I was uh be Jos um because they

1148
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:22,799
that I was uh be Jos um because they
 

1149
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,510
that I was uh be Jos um because they
they had me cornered at that point so to

1150
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:25,520
they had me cornered at that point so to
 

1151
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,830
they had me cornered at that point so to
you it's fundamentally une ethical like

1152
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:28,840
you it's fundamentally une ethical like
 

1153
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,830
you it's fundamentally une ethical like
uh so one is unethical for them to do

1154
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:30,840
uh so one is unethical for them to do
 

1155
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,549
uh so one is unethical for them to do
what they did but also do you think not

1156
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
what they did but also do you think not
 

1157
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,710
what they did but also do you think not
just your case but in the general case

1158
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
just your case but in the general case
 

1159
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,389
just your case but in the general case
is it good for society is it bad for

00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:39,399
is it good for society is it bad for
 

1161
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:41,310
is it good for society is it bad for

1167
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,669
is it Case by case I think it could be
quite bad like I said if anybody who

1289
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,350
thought it is a threat to that variance
if you can have swarms yeah of

1290
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:50,360
if you can have swarms yeah of
 

1291
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,430
if you can have swarms yeah of
non-biological beings because they can

1292
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:52,440
non-biological beings because they can
 

1293
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,470
non-biological beings because they can
be like the sheep and Animal Farm right

1294
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:55,480
be like the sheep and Animal Farm right
 

1295
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,310
be like the sheep and Animal Farm right
like you still within those swarms once

1296
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:57,320
like you still within those swarms once
 

1297
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,070
like you still within those swarms once
to have variance yeah I of course I

1298
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:00,080
to have variance yeah I of course I
 

1299
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,070
to have variance yeah I of course I
would say that the the solution to this

1300
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
would say that the the solution to this
 

1301
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,750
would say that the the solution to this
would be to you know have some sort of

1302
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:04,760
would be to you know have some sort of
 

1303
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,870
would be to you know have some sort of
identity or way to sign that this is a

1304
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:07,880
identity or way to sign that this is a
 

1305
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,549
identity or way to sign that this is a
certified human but still remain

1306
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
certified human but still remain
 

1307
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,470
certified human but still remain
pseudonymous right yeah um and I clearly

1308
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,480
pseudonymous right yeah um and I clearly
 

1309
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,310
pseudonymous right yeah um and I clearly
identify if a bot is a bot and I I think

1310
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:17,320
identify if a bot is a bot and I I think
 

1311
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,549
identify if a bot is a bot and I I think
Elon is trying to converge on that on X

1312
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:19,559
Elon is trying to converge on that on X
 

1313
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,470
Elon is trying to converge on that on X
and hopefully other platforms follow

1314
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:21,480
and hopefully other platforms follow
 

1315
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,590
and hopefully other platforms follow
suit yeah it would be interesting to

1316
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
suit yeah it would be interesting to
 

1317
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,950
suit yeah it would be interesting to
also be able to sign where the bot came

1318
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:25,960
also be able to sign where the bot came
 

1319
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,190
also be able to sign where the bot came
from right who created the bot and what

1320
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
from right who created the bot and what
 

1321
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,669
from right who created the bot and what
was well what are the parameters like

1322
00:31:32,669 --> 00:31:32,679
was well what are the parameters like
 

1323
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,389
was well what are the parameters like
the full history of the creation of the

1324
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:34,399
the full history of the creation of the
 

1325
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,830
the full history of the creation of the
bot what was the original model what was

1326
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:36,840
bot what was the original model what was
 

1327
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,950
bot what was the original model what was
the fine-tuning all it right like the

1328
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:39,960
the fine-tuning all it right like the
 

1329
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,509
the fine-tuning all it right like the
kind of um

1330
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:42,519
kind of um
 

1331
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,549
kind of um
unmodifiable history of the bot's

1332
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:44,559
unmodifiable history of the bot's
 

1333
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,310
unmodifiable history of the bot's
creation then you can know if there's a

1334
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:47,320
creation then you can know if there's a
 

1335
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,950
creation then you can know if there's a
like a swarm of millions of bots that

1336
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
like a swarm of millions of bots that
 

1337
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,190
like a swarm of millions of bots that
were created by a particular government

1338
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
were created by a particular government
 

1339
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,950
were created by a particular government
for example

1340
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
for example
 

1341
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,350
for example
right I do think that a lot of of

1342
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
right I do think that a lot of of
 

1343
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,350
right I do think that a lot of of
pervasive ideologies

1344
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
pervasive ideologies
 

1345
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,110
pervasive ideologies
today have been Amplified using sort of

1346
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:04,120
today have been Amplified using sort of
 

1347
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,269
today have been Amplified using sort of
these adversarial techniques from

1348
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:07,279
these adversarial techniques from
 

1349
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,110
these adversarial techniques from
foreign adversaries right um and to me I

1350
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:12,120
foreign adversaries right um and to me I
 

1351
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,230
foreign adversaries right um and to me I
I do think that and this is more

1352
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,240
I do think that and this is more
 

1353
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,389
I do think that and this is more
conspiratorial but I do think that

1354
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:18,399
conspiratorial but I do think that
 

1355
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,950
conspiratorial but I do think that
ideologies that want us to decelerate to

1356
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:23,960
ideologies that want us to decelerate to
 

1357
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,549
ideologies that want us to decelerate to
wind down to De you know the growth

1358
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:27,559
wind down to De you know the growth
 

1359
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:31,029
wind down to De you know the growth
movement uh I think that serves our

1360
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:31,039
movement uh I think that serves our
 

1361
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,549
movement uh I think that serves our
adversaries more than it serves Us in

1362
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:34,559
adversaries more than it serves Us in
 

1363
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,190
adversaries more than it serves Us in
general um and to me that was another

1364
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:38,200
general um and to me that was another
 

1365
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,350
general um and to me that was another
sort of concern I mean we can look at

1366
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
sort of concern I mean we can look at
 

1367
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,110
sort of concern I mean we can look at
what um happened in in Germany right uh

1368
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
what um happened in in Germany right uh
 

1369
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,029
what um happened in in Germany right uh
there was all sorts of green movements

1370
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:48,039
there was all sorts of green movements
 

1371
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:51,870
there was all sorts of green movements
there um where that induced shutdowns of

1372
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:51,880
there um where that induced shutdowns of
 

1373
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,950
there um where that induced shutdowns of
nuclear power plants and then that it

1374
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:55,960
nuclear power plants and then that it
 

1375
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,909
nuclear power plants and then that it
later on induced that

1376
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:57,919
later on induced that
 

1377
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,389
later on induced that
dependency on on Russia for for oil

1378
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:01,399
dependency on on Russia for for oil
 

1379
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:06,789
dependency on on Russia for for oil
right and um that was a net negative for

1380
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:06,799
right and um that was a net negative for
 

1381
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,310
right and um that was a net negative for
for Germany and the West right and so if

1382
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:09,320
for Germany and the West right and so if
 

1383
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,830
for Germany and the West right and so if
we convince ourselves that slowing down

1384
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:12,840
we convince ourselves that slowing down
 

1385
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,110
we convince ourselves that slowing down
AI progress uh to have only a few

1386
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,120
AI progress uh to have only a few
 

1387
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,789
AI progress uh to have only a few
players is in the best interest of the

1388
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:17,799
players is in the best interest of the
 

1389
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:20,029
players is in the best interest of the
West first of all that's far more

1390
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:20,039
West first of all that's far more
 

1391
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,789
West first of all that's far more
unstable we almost lost opening eye to

1392
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:23,799
unstable we almost lost opening eye to
 

1393
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,950
unstable we almost lost opening eye to
this ideology right it almost got

1394
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:25,960
this ideology right it almost got
 

1395
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,350
this ideology right it almost got
dismantled right a couple weeks ago um

1396
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
dismantled right a couple weeks ago um
 

1397
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,549
dismantled right a couple weeks ago um
that would have caused huge damage to

1398
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:31,559
that would have caused huge damage to
 

1399
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,230
that would have caused huge damage to
the AI ecosystem and so to me I want

1400
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,240
the AI ecosystem and so to me I want
 

1401
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,070
the AI ecosystem and so to me I want
fault tolerant progress I want the arrow

1402
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,080
fault tolerant progress I want the arrow
 

1403
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,590

government-backed AI cartel that could
 

1697
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,109
government-backed AI cartel that could
have absolute power over the people if

1698
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:47,119
have absolute power over the people if

1701
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,829
they have the Monopoly together on AI
and nobody else has access to AI then

1702
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:52,839
and nobody else has access to AI then
 

1703
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:54,910

there's a huge power gradient there and

1704
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:54,920
there's a huge power gradient there and
 

1705
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,710
there's a huge power gradient there and
even if you like our current leader ERS

1706
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:56,720
even if you like our current leader ERS
 

1707
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,950
even if you like our current leader ERS
right I think that you know some of the

1708
00:40:58,950 --> 00:40:58,960
right I think that you know some of the
 

1709
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,750
right I think that you know some of the
leaders in big Tech today are good

power structure it becomes a

1714
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:07,240
power structure it becomes a
 

1715
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,870
power structure it becomes a
Target right just like we saw at open

1716
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:09,880
Target right just like we saw at open
 

1717
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,470
Target right just like we saw at open
the eye it becomes a market leader has a

1718
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,480
the eye it becomes a market leader has a
 

1719
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,870
the eye it becomes a market leader has a
lot of the power and now it becomes a

1720
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:14,880
lot of the power and now it becomes a
 

1721
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,190
lot of the power and now it becomes a
target for those that want to co-opt it

1722
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:18,200
target for those that want to co-opt it
 

1723
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,670
target for those that want to co-opt it
and so I just want separation of AI and

1724
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:22,680
and so I just want separation of AI and
 

1725
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,230
and so I just want separation of AI and
and state you know some might argue in

1726
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:25,240
and state you know some might argue in
 

1727
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,069
and state you know some might argue in
the opposite direction like hey we need

1728
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:27,079
the opposite direction like hey we need
 

1729
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:30,150
the opposite direction like hey we need
to close down AI keep it behind closed

1730
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,160
to close down AI keep it behind closed
 

1731
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,470
to close down AI keep it behind closed

capture the space and so what I'm trying
 

1947
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,109
capture the space and so what I'm trying
to do is sort of explode the variance of

2019
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:58,430
we're not at the center of this space
but we made that realization for

00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:58,440
but we made that realization for
 

2021
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,790
but we made that realization for
astronomy and we've survived and we've

that give us a warning uh and so

2034
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:14,359
that give us a warning uh and so
 

2035
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:15,829
that give us a warning uh and so
similarly I think

2036
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:15,839
similarly I think
 

2037

every day we have our our phones I think

2084
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:20,040
every day we have our our phones I think
 

2085
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,030
every day we have our our phones I think
the system is beautiful and the

2086
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,040
the system is beautiful and the
 

2087
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:25,190
the system is beautiful and the
principle that uh induces this sort of

2088
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
principle that uh induces this sort of
 

2089
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:29,309
principle that uh induces this sort of
adapt ability and convergence on uh

2090
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:29,319
adapt ability and convergence on uh
 

2091
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:33,309
adapt ability and convergence on uh
optimal uh Technologies ideas and so on

optimal uh Technologies ideas and so on
 

2093
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:35,870
optimal uh Technologies ideas and so on
it's it's a beautiful principle that

2094
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:35,880
it's it's a beautiful principle that
 

2095
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,109
it's it's a beautiful principle that
we're part of and I think part of eak is

2096
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:41,119
we're part of and I think part of eak is
 

2097
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,190
we're part of and I think part of eak is
to um appreciate this principle in a way

2098
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
to um appreciate this principle in a way
 

2099
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,470
to um appreciate this principle in a way
that's not just centered on on Humanity

2100
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:48,480
that's not just centered on on Humanity
 

2101
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,069
that's not just centered on on Humanity
but kind of broader um appreciate uh

2102
00:49:52,069 --> 00:49:52,079
but kind of broader um appreciate uh
 

2103
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,870
but kind of broader um appreciate uh
life um you know the preciousness of of

00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:07,319
got to feel the responsibility to to
 

2113
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:10,510
got to feel the responsibility to to
scale it in order to preserve it because

2114
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:10,520
scale it in order to preserve it because
 

2115
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:15,910
scale it in order to preserve it because
the options are to grow or die so if it

turns out that the beauty that is
 

2119
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,309
turns out that the beauty that is
consciousness in the universe is bigger

00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:24,480
than just humans the AI can carry that
 

2123
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,109
than just humans the AI can carry that
same flame forward

2125
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,390

does it scare you are you concerned that

2126
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:30,400
does it scare you are you concerned that
 

2127
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,829
does it scare you are you concerned that
AI will replace humans so during my

00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:33,839
AI will replace humans so during my
 

2129
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:37,150
AI will replace humans so during my
career I had a moment where I realized

2130
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:37,160
career I had a moment where I realized
 

2131
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,230
career I had a moment where I realized
that you know maybe we need to offload

2132
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:41,240
that you know maybe we need to offload
 

2133
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,150
that you know maybe we need to offload
to machines to truly understand the

00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:43,160
to machines to truly understand the
 

2135
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,309
to machines to truly understand the
universe around us right instead of just

2136
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:46,319
universe around us right instead of just
 

2137
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,710
universe around us right instead of just
having humans with pen and paper solve

2138
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,720
having humans with pen and paper solve
 

2139
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,630
having humans with pen and paper solve
it all and to me that sort of process of

2140
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:54,640
it all and to me that sort of process of
 

2141
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,109
it all and to me that sort of process of
letting go of a bit of

2142
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
letting go of a bit of
 

2143
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,109
letting go of a bit of
agency gave us way more leverage to

2144
00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:00,119
agency gave us way more leverage to
 

2145
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:02,150
agency gave us way more leverage to
understand the world around us a quantum

2146
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:02,160
understand the world around us a quantum
 

2147
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,109
understand the world around us a quantum
computer is much better than a human to

2148
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:04,119
computer is much better than a human to
 

2149
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:07,190
computer is much better than a human to
understand matter at the at the Nano

2150
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,200
understand matter at the at the Nano
 

2151
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,630
understand matter at the at the Nano
scale similarly I think that Humanity

2152
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:12,640
scale similarly I think that Humanity
 

2153
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,630
scale similarly I think that Humanity
has a choice do we accept the

2154
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:15,640
has a choice do we accept the
 

2155
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,510
has a choice do we accept the
opportunity to have intellectual and

2156
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:18,520
opportunity to have intellectual and
 

2157
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,589
opportunity to have intellectual and
operational leverage that AI will unlock

2158
00:51:21,589 --> 00:51:21,599
operational leverage that AI will unlock
 

2159
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:25,190
operational leverage that AI will unlock
and thus ensure that we're taking along

2160
00:51:25,190 --> 00:51:25,200
and thus ensure that we're taking along
 

2161
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,069
and thus ensure that we're taking along
the path of growth in scope and scale of

00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,230
civilization we may dilute ourselves
right uh there might be a lot of workers

2166
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:34,240
right uh there might be a lot of workers
 

2167
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,589
right uh there might be a lot of workers
that are AI but overall out of our own

2168
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:38,599
that are AI but overall out of our own

00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,789
that are AI but overall out of our own
self-interest by combining and

self-interest by combining and
 

2171
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:42,349
self-interest by combining and
augmenting ourselves with

2172
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:42,359
augmenting ourselves with
 

2173
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:45,789
augmenting ourselves with
AI uh we're going to achieve much higher

2174
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:45,799
AI uh we're going to achieve much higher
 

2175
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:49,309
AI uh we're going to achieve much higher
growth and much more Prosperity right to

00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:49,319
growth and much more Prosperity right to
 

2177
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,910

me I think that the most likely future

2178
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:51,920
me I think that the most likely future
 

2179
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,950
me I think that the most likely future
is one where humans augment themselves

2180
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:55,960
is one where humans augment themselves
 

2181
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,589
is one where humans augment themselves
with AI I think we're already on this

2182
00:51:58,589 --> 00:51:58,599
with AI I think we're already on this
 

2183
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,950
with AI I think we're already on this
path to augmentation we have phones we

2184
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:00,960
path to augmentation we have phones we
 

2185
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,990
path to augmentation we have phones we
use for communication we have on

2186
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:03,000
use for communication we have on
 

2187
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,789
use for communication we have on
ourselves at all times we have wearables

2188
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:05,799
ourselves at all times we have wearables
 

2189
00:52:05,799 --> 00:52:09,430
ourselves at all times we have wearables
soon that have shared perception with us

2190
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
soon that have shared perception with us
 

2191
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,390
soon that have shared perception with us
right like the Humane AI pin or I mean

2192
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:12,400
right like the Humane AI pin or I mean
 

2193
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,150
right like the Humane AI pin or I mean
technically your Tesla car has shared

2194
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:15,160
technically your Tesla car has shared
 

2195
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,109
technically your Tesla car has shared
perception and so if you have shared

2196
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:17,119
perception and so if you have shared
 

2197
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,309
perception and so if you have shared
experience shared context you

2198
00:52:19,309 --> 00:52:19,319
experience shared context you
 

2199
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:20,829
experience shared context you
communicate with one

2200
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:20,839
communicate with one
 

2201
00:52:20,839 --> 00:52:24,789
communicate with one
another and you have some sort of IO

2202
00:52:24,789 --> 00:52:24,799
another and you have some sort of IO
 

2203
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:25,829
another and you have some sort of IO
really

2204
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839
really
 

2205
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,549
really
it's an extension of

2206
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:27,559
it's an extension of
 

2207
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:32,190
it's an extension of
yourself um and to me I think

2208
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:32,200
yourself um and to me I think
 

2209
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,829
yourself um and to me I think
that Humanity augmenting itself with AI

2210
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:37,839
that Humanity augmenting itself with AI
 

2211
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,549
that Humanity augmenting itself with AI
and having AI that is not

2212
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
and having AI that is not
 

2213
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,349
and having AI that is not
anchored to anything biological both

2214
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:44,359
anchored to anything biological both
 

2215
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:47,589
anchored to anything biological both
will coexist and the way to align the

2216
00:52:47,589 --> 00:52:47,599
will coexist and the way to align the
 

2217
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,470
will coexist and the way to align the
parties we already have a sort of

2218
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480
parties we already have a sort of
 

2219
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,430
parties we already have a sort of
mechanism to align super intelligences

2220
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:53,440
mechanism to align super intelligences
 

2221
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,309
mechanism to align super intelligences
that are made of humans and Technology

2222
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:55,319
that are made of humans and Technology
 

2223
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:58,589
that are made of humans and Technology
ology right companies are sort of large

2224
00:52:58,589 --> 00:52:58,599
ology right companies are sort of large
 

2225
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:01,789
ology right companies are sort of large
mixture of expert models where we have

2226
00:53:01,789 --> 00:53:01,799
mixture of expert models where we have
 

2227
00:53:01,799 --> 00:53:05,030
mixture of expert models where we have
neural routing of tasks within a company

2228
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,040
neural routing of tasks within a company
 

2229
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,549
neural routing of tasks within a company
and we have ways of economic exchange to

2230
00:53:07,549 --> 00:53:07,559
and we have ways of economic exchange to
 

2231
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,990
and we have ways of economic exchange to
align these behemoths and to me I think

2232
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,000
align these behemoths and to me I think
 

2233
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,870
align these behemoths and to me I think
capitalism is the way and I do think

2234
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:15,880
capitalism is the way and I do think
 

2235
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,870
capitalism is the way and I do think
that whatever configuration of matter or

2236
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:19,880
that whatever configuration of matter or
 

2237
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,710
that whatever configuration of matter or

predict the future all we know the only
prior we have is the laws of

prior we have is the laws of
 

2531
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,029
prior we have is the laws of

2532
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:16,039
physics and that's that's what we're
 

2533
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:18,029
physics and that's that's what we're
arguing for the laws of physics say the

01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:18,039
arguing for the laws of physics say the

system will want to grow and subsystems

2536
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:21,359

2537
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:24,990
system will want to grow and subsystems
that are optimized for growth are more

2538
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:25,000
that are optimized for growth are more
 

2539
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,349
that are optimized for growth are more
and replication are more likely in the

2540
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
and replication are more likely in the
 

2541
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:30,910
and replication are more likely in the
future and so we should aim to maximize

2542
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:30,920
future and so we should aim to maximize
 

2543
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,910

our current Mutual information with the

our current Mutual information with the
 

2545
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,470
our current Mutual information with the
future and the path towards that is for

2546
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:35,480
future and the path towards that is for
 

2547
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,069
future and the path towards that is for
us to accelerate rather than

01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:39,079
us to accelerate rather than
 

2549
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:42,710
us to accelerate rather than
decelerate so I don't have a p Doom

2550
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:42,720
decelerate so I don't have a p Doom
 

2551
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:46,230
decelerate so I don't have a p Doom
because I think that you know similar to

Google I was in the room when they were

2556
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:50,760
Google I was in the room when they were
 

2557
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:53,150
Google I was in the room when they were
running the simulations for that that

2558
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:53,160
running the simulations for that that
 

2559
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,829
running the simulations for that that
was an example of a Quantum chaotic

2560
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:55,839
was an example of a Quantum chaotic
 

2561
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,510
was an example of a Quantum chaotic
system where you you cannot even

2562
01:00:58,510 --> 01:00:58,520
system where you you cannot even
 

2563
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,910
system where you you cannot even
estimate probabilities of certain

2564
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:00,920
estimate probabilities of certain
 

2565
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,109
estimate probabilities of certain
outcomes uh with even the biggest

2566
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:03,119
outcomes uh with even the biggest
 

2567
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,589
outcomes uh with even the biggest
supercomputer in the world right and um

2568
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:06,599
supercomputer in the world right and um
 

2569
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,109
supercomputer in the world right and um
so that's an example of chaos and I

2570
01:01:08,109 --> 01:01:08,119
so that's an example of chaos and I
 

2571
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:10,829
so that's an example of chaos and I
think the system is far too chaotic for

2572
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:10,839
think the system is far too chaotic for
 

2573
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:15,109
think the system is far too chaotic for
anybody to have an accurate uh estimate

2574
01:01:15,109 --> 01:01:15,119
anybody to have an accurate uh estimate
 

2575
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,309
anybody to have an accurate uh estimate
of the likelihood of certain Futures if

2576
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:18,319
of the likelihood of certain Futures if
 

2577
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:19,789
of the likelihood of certain Futures if
they were that good I think they would

2578
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:19,799
they were that good I think they would
 

2579
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:22,349
they were that good I think they would

could even convince the public that AI
 

2651
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:01,670
could even convince the public that AI
never existed and that opens up sort of

01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,510

these scenarios for

to me is the The Darkest Timeline and

to me is the The Darkest Timeline and

the reality is that we have we have a

right like my prior came from the

01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:39,950
right like my prior came from the

to these AI doomers I just asked them to

to these AI doomers I just asked them to
 

2681
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:46,950
to these AI doomers I just asked them to
trace a path through this Markoff chain

01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
trace a path through this Markoff chain
 

2683

trace a path through this Markoff chain
of events that would lead to our Doom

of events that would lead to our Doom
 

2685
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:50,990
of events that would lead to our Doom
right and to actually give me a good

01:03:50,990 --> 01:03:51,000
right and to actually give me a good
 

2687
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,630
right and to actually give me a good
probability for each transition and very

2688
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:53,640
probability for each transition and very
 

2689
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:54,950

often

01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:54,960
often
 

2691
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,549

there's a unphysical or highly unlikely

there's a unphysical or highly unlikely
 

2693
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:01,630
there's a unphysical or highly unlikely
transition in that chain right but of

01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:01,640
transition in that chain right but of
 

2695
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:06,470
transition in that chain right but of
course we're wired to fear things and

2696
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:06,480
course we're wired to fear things and
 

2697
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,390
course we're wired to fear things and
we're wired to respond to danger and

2698
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:09,400
we're wired to respond to danger and
 

2699
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,029
we're wired to respond to danger and
we're wired

2700
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:11,039
we're wired
 

2701
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,510
we're wired
to deem the unknown to be dangerous

2702
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:14,520
to deem the unknown to be dangerous
 

2703
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,630
to deem the unknown to be dangerous
because that's a good heuristic for

01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:16,640
because that's a good heuristic for
 

2705
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,430
because that's a good heuristic for
survival right but there's much more to

01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:20,440
survival right but there's much more to
 

2707
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,069

01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:32,190
upside to lose by preemptively stopping
the positive futures from from happening

2714
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:32,200
the positive futures from from happening
 

2715
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:36,230
the positive futures from from happening
out of fear um and so I think that we

2716
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
out of fear um and so I think that we
 

2717
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,349
out of fear um and so I think that we
shouldn't uh give into fear uh fear is

2718
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:39,359
shouldn't uh give into fear uh fear is
 

2719
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:41,109
shouldn't uh give into fear uh fear is
the mind killer I think it's also the

2720
01:04:41,109 --> 01:04:41,119
the mind killer I think it's also the
 

2721
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:43,870
the mind killer I think it's also the
civilization killer we can still think

2722
01:04:43,870 --> 01:04:43,880
civilization killer we can still think
 

2723
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,190
civilization killer we can still think
about the various ways things go wrong

2724
01:04:46,190 --> 01:04:46,200
about the various ways things go wrong
 

2725
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:48,109
about the various ways things go wrong
for example the founding fathers of this

2726
01:04:48,109 --> 01:04:48,119
for example the founding fathers of this
 

2727
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:50,870
for example the founding fathers of this
uh the United States thought about human

2728
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:50,880
uh the United States thought about human
 

2729
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,829
uh the United States thought about human
nature and that's why there's a

2730
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:52,839
nature and that's why there's a
 

2731
01:04:52,839 --> 01:04:55,630
nature and that's why there's a
discussion about the freedoms that are

2732
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:55,640
discussion about the freedoms that are
 

2733
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,589
discussion about the freedoms that are
necessary they really deeply deliberated

2734
01:04:58,589 --> 01:04:58,599
necessary they really deeply deliberated
 

2735
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:00,390
necessary they really deeply deliberated
about that and I think the same could

2736
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:00,400
about that and I think the same could
 

2737
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,109
about that and I think the same could
possibly be done for AGI it is true that

2738
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:04,119
possibly be done for AGI it is true that
 

2739
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:05,870
possibly be done for AGI it is true that
history human history

2740
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:05,880
history human history
 

2741
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,990
history human history
shows that we tend towards

2742
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:08,000
shows that we tend towards
 

2743
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,870
shows that we tend towards
centralization or at least when we

2744
01:05:09,870 --> 01:05:09,880
centralization or at least when we
 

2745
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,269
centralization or at least when we
achieve centralization a lot of bad

2746
01:05:12,269 --> 01:05:12,279
achieve centralization a lot of bad
 

2747
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:14,789
achieve centralization a lot of bad
stuff happens when there's a

2748
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
stuff happens when there's a
 

2749
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:18,630
stuff happens when there's a
dictator a lot of dark bad things happen

2750
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:18,640
dictator a lot of dark bad things happen
 

2751
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,390
dictator a lot of dark bad things happen
the question is can AGI become that

2752
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:22,400
the question is can AGI become that
 

2753
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,789
the question is can AGI become that
dictator can AGI and develop become the

2754
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:27,799
dictator can AGI and develop become the
 

2755
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:30,829
dictator can AGI and develop become the
centralizer because of its power maybe

2756
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:30,839
centralizer because of its power maybe
 

2757
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:33,309
centralizer because of its power maybe
it has the same because of the alignment

2758
01:05:33,309 --> 01:05:33,319
it has the same because of the alignment
 

2759
01:05:33,319 --> 01:05:36,349
it has the same because of the alignment
of humans perhaps the same Tendencies

2760
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:36,359
of humans perhaps the same Tendencies
 

2761
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:39,470
of humans perhaps the same Tendencies
the same uh Stalin like Tendencies to

2762
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:39,480
the same uh Stalin like Tendencies to
 

2763
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,309
the same uh Stalin like Tendencies to
centralize and manage centrally the

2764
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:43,319
centralize and manage centrally the
 

2765
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:45,750
centralize and manage centrally the
allocation of resources and you can even

2766
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:45,760
allocation of resources and you can even
 

2767
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,230
allocation of resources and you can even
see that as an compelling argument on

2768
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:48,240
see that as an compelling argument on
 

2769
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,470
see that as an compelling argument on
the surface level well AGI is so much

2770
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:50,480
the surface level well AGI is so much
 

2771
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,789
the surface level well AGI is so much
smarter so much more efficient so much

2772
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:52,799
smarter so much more efficient so much
 

2773
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,549
smarter so much more efficient so much
better at allocating resources es why

2774
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:54,559
better at allocating resources es why
 

2775
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,029
better at allocating resources es why
don't we Outsource it to the

2776
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:57,039
don't we Outsource it to the
 

2777
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:00,910
don't we Outsource it to the
AGI and then eventually whatever forces

2778
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:00,920
AGI and then eventually whatever forces
 

2779
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,029
AGI and then eventually whatever forces
that uh corrupt the human mind with

2780
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:03,039
that uh corrupt the human mind with
 

2781
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:06,069
that uh corrupt the human mind with
power could do the same for AGI he'll

2782
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:06,079
power could do the same for AGI he'll
 

2783
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,309
power could do the same for AGI he'll
just say well humans dispensable we'll

2784
01:06:09,309 --> 01:06:09,319
just say well humans dispensable we'll
 

2785
01:06:09,319 --> 01:06:12,470
just say well humans dispensable we'll
get rid of them do the Jonathan Swift

2786
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:12,480
get rid of them do the Jonathan Swift

Proposal from a few centuries ago I

2790
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
Proposal from a few centuries ago I
 

2791
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,230
Proposal from a few centuries ago I
think the

2792
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:18,240
think the
 

2793
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,630
think the
1700s when he satirically

2794
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:21,640
1700s when he satirically
 

2795
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,470
1700s when he satirically
suggested that I think it's in Ireland

2796
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:25,480
suggested that I think it's in Ireland
 

2797
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:29,750
suggested that I think it's in Ireland
that the the children of poor people are

2798
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
that the the children of poor people are
 

2799
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:33,670
that the the children of poor people are
fed as food to the rich people and that

2800
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:33,680
fed as food to the rich people and that
 

2801
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,190
fed as food to the rich people and that
would be a good idea because it

2802
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:35,200
would be a good idea because it
 

2803
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,230
would be a good idea because it
decreases the amount of poor people and

2804
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:38,240
decreases the amount of poor people and
 

2805
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,589
decreases the amount of poor people and
gives extra income to the poor people so

2806
01:06:40,589 --> 01:06:40,599
gives extra income to the poor people so
 

2807
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:43,950
gives extra income to the poor people so
it's on several accounts decreases the

2808
01:06:43,950 --> 01:06:43,960
it's on several accounts decreases the
 

2809
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,990
it's on several accounts decreases the
amount of poor people therefore more

2810
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:47,000
amount of poor people therefore more
 

2811
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,269
amount of poor people therefore more
people become

2812
01:06:48,269 --> 01:06:48,279
people become
 

2813
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:51,309
people become
rich uh of course it misses a

2814
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:51,319
rich uh of course it misses a
 

2815
01:06:51,319 --> 01:06:54,029
rich uh of course it misses a
fundamental piece here that's hard to

2816
01:06:54,029 --> 01:06:54,039
fundamental piece here that's hard to
 

2817
01:06:54,039 --> 01:06:56,710
fundamental piece here that's hard to
put into a mathematical equation of the

2818
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:56,720
put into a mathematical equation of the
 

2819
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,549
put into a mathematical equation of the
basic value of human

2820
01:06:58,549 --> 01:06:58,559
basic value of human
 

2821
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,069
basic value of human
life so all of that to say are you

2822
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:02,079
life so all of that to say are you
 

2823
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,069
life so all of that to say are you
concerned about AGI being the very

2824
01:07:05,069 --> 01:07:05,079
concerned about AGI being the very
 

2825
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:07,069
concerned about AGI being the very
centralizer of power that you just

2826
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:07,079
centralizer of power that you just
 

2827
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:08,150
centralizer of power that you just
talked

2828
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,160
talked
 

2829
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,510
talked
about I do think that um right now

2830
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:12,520
about I do think that um right now
 

2831
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,990
about I do think that um right now
there's a bias towards over

2832
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:15,000
there's a bias towards over
 

2833
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,549
there's a bias towards over
centralization of AI because of compute

2834
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:18,559
centralization of AI because of compute
 

2835
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,910
centralization of AI because of compute
density and centralization

2836
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:20,920
density and centralization
 

2837
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,029
density and centralization
centralization of data and how we're

2838
01:07:23,029 --> 01:07:23,039
centralization of data and how we're
 

2839
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,670
centralization of data and how we're
training um models um I think over time

2840
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:26,680
training um models um I think over time
 

2841
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,510
training um models um I think over time
we're going to run out of data to scrape

2842
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:28,520
we're going to run out of data to scrape
 

2843
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,150
we're going to run out of data to scrape
over the internet and I think that well

2844
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:31,160
over the internet and I think that well
 

2845
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,710
over the internet and I think that well
actually I'm working on increasing the

2846
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:32,720
actually I'm working on increasing the
 

2847
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,349
actually I'm working on increasing the
compute density so that compute can be

2848
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:35,359
compute density so that compute can be
 

2849
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:38,589
compute density so that compute can be
everywhere and acquire information and

2850
01:07:38,589 --> 01:07:38,599
everywhere and acquire information and
 

2851
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:41,390
everywhere and acquire information and
test hypothesis in the environment in a

2852
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:41,400
test hypothesis in the environment in a
 

2853
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,829
test hypothesis in the environment in a
distributed uh fashion I think that

2854
01:07:43,829 --> 01:07:43,839
distributed uh fashion I think that
 

2855
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:46,309
distributed uh fashion I think that

that's just never been the optimum right

2872
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:08,200
that's just never been the optimum right
 

2873
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:11,150
that's just never been the optimum right
like let's say you have uh a company you

2874
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:11,160
like let's say you have uh a company you
 

2875
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,470
like let's say you have uh a company you
know if you have a company I don't know

2876
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:13,480
know if you have a company I don't know
 

2877
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:15,349
know if you have a company I don't know
of 10,000 people that all report to the

2878
01:08:15,349 --> 01:08:15,359
of 10,000 people that all report to the
 

2879
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,309
of 10,000 people that all report to the
CEO even if that CEO is an AI I think it

2880
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
CEO even if that CEO is an AI I think it
 

2881
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,709
CEO even if that CEO is an AI I think it
would struggle to fuse all the

2882
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:21,719
would struggle to fuse all the
 

2883
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:24,070
would struggle to fuse all the
information that is coming to it and

2884
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,080
information that is coming to it and
 

2885
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,349
information that is coming to it and
then predict the whole system and then

2886
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:26,359
then predict the whole system and then
 

2887
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:29,669
then predict the whole system and then
to enact its its will what has emerged

2888
01:08:29,669 --> 01:08:29,679
to enact its its will what has emerged
 

2889
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,430
to enact its its will what has emerged
in nature and in corporations and all

2890
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:32,440
in nature and in corporations and all
 

2891
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:35,590
in nature and in corporations and all
sorts of systems is a notion of sort of

01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:35,600
sorts of systems is a notion of sort of
 

2893
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,870

01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:37,880
hierarchical cybernetic control right
 

2895
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:40,269
hierarchical cybernetic control right
you have uh you know in a company would

2911
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,430

base let's say you're in a software

2912
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,440

iterate it on it uh intraday right and

2916
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:04,199
iterate it on it uh intraday right and
 

2917
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:06,829
iterate it on it uh intraday right and
then the management maybe checks in it

2918
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:06,839
then the management maybe checks in it
 

2919
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:10,070
then the management maybe checks in it
has a wider scope it has let's say five

2920
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,080
has a wider scope it has let's say five
 

2921
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,669

reports right and then it samples each U

2922
01:09:13,669 --> 01:09:13,679
reports right and then it samples each U
 

2923
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:16,030
reports right and then it samples each U
person's update once per week and then

2924
01:09:16,030 --> 01:09:16,040
person's update once per week and then
 

2925
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,789
person's update once per week and then
you can go up the chain and you have

2926
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:17,799
you can go up the chain and you have
 

2927
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:20,430
you can go up the chain and you have
larger time scale and greater scope and

2928
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:20,440
larger time scale and greater scope and
 

2929
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,309
larger time scale and greater scope and
that seems to have emerged as sort of

2930
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:22,319
that seems to have emerged as sort of
 

2931
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,789
that seems to have emerged as sort of
the the optimal way to to control

2932
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:24,799
the the optimal way to to control
 

2933
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:27,950
the the optimal way to to control
systems and and really that's what

2934
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:27,960
systems and and really that's what
 

2935
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,030
systems and and really that's what
capitalism gives us right you have these

2936
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
capitalism gives us right you have these
 

2937
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,749
capitalism gives us right you have these
these hierarchies and you can even have

2938
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:32,759
these hierarchies and you can even have
 

2939
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:36,229
these hierarchies and you can even have
like parent companies and so on and so

2940
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:36,239
like parent companies and so on and so
 

2941
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:39,510
like parent companies and so on and so
that is far more fault tolerant in

2942
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:39,520
that is far more fault tolerant in
 

2943
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,309
that is far more fault tolerant in
Quantum Computing that's my feeli I came

2944
01:09:41,309 --> 01:09:41,319
Quantum Computing that's my feeli I came
 

2945
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:44,149
Quantum Computing that's my feeli I came
from we have a a concept of of this

2946
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:44,159
from we have a a concept of of this
 

2947
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:45,550
from we have a a concept of of this
fault tolerance and Quantum air

2948
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:45,560
fault tolerance and Quantum air
 

2949
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,189
fault tolerance and Quantum air
correction right Quantum air correction

2950
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:47,199
correction right Quantum air correction
 

2951
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,669
correction right Quantum air correction
is detecting a fault that came from

2952
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
is detecting a fault that came from
 

2953
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,709
is detecting a fault that came from
noise predicting how it's propagated

2954
01:09:52,709 --> 01:09:52,719
noise predicting how it's propagated
 

2955
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:54,070
noise predicting how it's propagated
through the system and then and then

2956
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
through the system and then and then
 

2957
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,830
through the system and then and then
correcting it right so it's a cybernetic

2958
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
correcting it right so it's a cybernetic
 

2959
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,030
correcting it right so it's a cybernetic
Loop and it turns out that uh decoders

2960
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:00,040
Loop and it turns out that uh decoders
 

2961
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,630
Loop and it turns out that uh decoders
uh that are hierarchical and at each

2962
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:02,640
uh that are hierarchical and at each
 

2963
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,189
uh that are hierarchical and at each
level the hierarchy are local uh perform

2964
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
level the hierarchy are local uh perform
 

2965
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:08,390
level the hierarchy are local uh perform
the best by far and are far more fall

2966
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:08,400
the best by far and are far more fall
 

2967
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,229
the best by far and are far more fall
tolerant and the reason is if you have a

2968
01:10:11,229 --> 01:10:11,239
tolerant and the reason is if you have a
 

2969
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:13,630
tolerant and the reason is if you have a
non-local decoder then you have one

2970
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:13,640
non-local decoder then you have one
 

2971
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:17,990
non-local decoder then you have one
fault at at this uh control node and the

2972
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
fault at at this uh control node and the
 

2973
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,430
fault at at this uh control node and the
whole system sort of crashes similarly

2974
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:20,440
whole system sort of crashes similarly
 

2975
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:24,750
whole system sort of crashes similarly
to if you have uh you know uh one CEO

2976
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:24,760
to if you have uh you know uh one CEO
 

2977
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,590
to if you have uh you know uh one CEO
that everybody reports to and that CEO

2978
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:26,600
that everybody reports to and that CEO
 

2979
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,630
that everybody reports to and that CEO
goes on vacation the whole company comes

2980
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:28,640
goes on vacation the whole company comes
 

2981
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,870
goes on vacation the whole company comes
to crawl right um and so to me I think

2982
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:31,880
to crawl right um and so to me I think
 

2983
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,229
to crawl right um and so to me I think
that yes we're seeing a tendency towards

2984
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:35,239
that yes we're seeing a tendency towards
 

2985
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:37,630
that yes we're seeing a tendency towards
centralization of AI but I think there's

2986
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:37,640
centralization of AI but I think there's
 

2987
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,110
centralization of AI but I think there's
going to be a correction over time where

2988
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:40,120
going to be a correction over time where
 

2989
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,189
going to be a correction over time where
intelligence is going to go closer to

2990
01:10:42,189 --> 01:10:42,199
intelligence is going to go closer to
 

2991
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:44,750
intelligence is going to go closer to
the perception and we're going to we're

2992
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:44,760
the perception and we're going to we're
 

2993
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,709
the perception and we're going to we're
going to break up AI into um um smaller

2994
01:10:49,709 --> 01:10:49,719
going to break up AI into um um smaller
 

2995
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:51,630
going to break up AI into um um smaller
subsystems that communicate with one

2996
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:51,640
subsystems that communicate with one
 

2997
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,070
subsystems that communicate with one
another and form a sort of meta uh

2998
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:55,080
another and form a sort of meta uh
 

2999
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,390
another and form a sort of meta uh
system so if you look at the hierarchies

3000
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:57,400
system so if you look at the hierarchies
 

3001
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:00,390
system so if you look at the hierarchies
there in the world today there's Nations

3002
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:00,400
there in the world today there's Nations
 

3003
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,590
there in the world today there's Nations
and those all hierarchical but in

3004
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:02,600
and those all hierarchical but in
 

3005
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,709
and those all hierarchical but in
relation to each other nations are

3006
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:04,719
relation to each other nations are
 

3007
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:06,590
relation to each other nations are
anarchic so it's an

3008
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:06,600
anarchic so it's an
 

3009
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,790
anarchic so it's an
anarchy would you do you foresee a world

3010
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:08,800
anarchy would you do you foresee a world
 

3011
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,070
anarchy would you do you foresee a world
like this where there's not a

3012
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:13,080
like this where there's not a
 

3013
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,310
like this where there's not a
over what you call it a centralized

3014
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:15,320
over what you call it a centralized
 

3015
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,870
over what you call it a centralized
cybernetic control centralized locus of

3016
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:17,880
cybernetic control centralized locus of
 

3017
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:21,990
cybernetic control centralized locus of
control yeah so like that's suboptimally

3018
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,000
control yeah so like that's suboptimally
 

3019
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,310
control yeah so like that's suboptimally
you're saying yeah so it would be always

3020
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:24,320
you're saying yeah so it would be always
 

3021
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,709
you're saying yeah so it would be always
a state of competition at the very top

3022
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:26,719
a state of competition at the very top
 

3023
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,750
a state of competition at the very top
level yeah just like you know in a

3024
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:29,760
level yeah just like you know in a
 

3025
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,030
level yeah just like you know in a
company you may have like uh two units

3026
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
company you may have like uh two units
 

3027
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:34,830
company you may have like uh two units
working on similar technology and

3028
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:34,840
working on similar technology and
 

3029
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:37,030
working on similar technology and
competing with one other and you you

3030
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
competing with one other and you you
 

3031
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,390
competing with one other and you you
prune the one that performs not as well

3032
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:39,400
prune the one that performs not as well
 

3033
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,790
prune the one that performs not as well
right and that's a sort of selection

3034
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
right and that's a sort of selection
 

3035
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,070
right and that's a sort of selection
process for a tree or a product gets

3036
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:43,080
process for a tree or a product gets
 

3037
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,030
process for a tree or a product gets
killed right and then a hole or gets

3038
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:46,040
killed right and then a hole or gets
 

3039
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,390
killed right and then a hole or gets
fired and that's this process of of

3040
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:49,400
fired and that's this process of of
 

3041
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,550
fired and that's this process of of
trying new things and and and shedding

3042
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
trying new things and and and shedding
 

3043
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,229
trying new things and and and shedding
old things that didn't work is this it's

3044
01:11:55,229 --> 01:11:55,239
old things that didn't work is this it's
 

3045
01:11:55,239 --> 01:11:57,750
old things that didn't work is this it's
what gives us adaptability and helps us

3046
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:57,760
what gives us adaptability and helps us
 

3047
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,629
what gives us adaptability and helps us
Converge on uh you know the Technologies

3048
01:12:00,629 --> 01:12:00,639
Converge on uh you know the Technologies
 

3049
01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:04,149
Converge on uh you know the Technologies
and things to do that are most good I

3050
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:04,159
and things to do that are most good I
 

3051
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,990
and things to do that are most good I
just hope there's not a failure mode

3052
01:12:05,990 --> 01:12:06,000
just hope there's not a failure mode
 

3053
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,229
just hope there's not a failure mode
that's unique to AGI versus Humans

3054
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:08,239
that's unique to AGI versus Humans
 

3055
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:09,950
that's unique to AGI versus Humans
because you're describing human systems

3056
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:09,960
because you're describing human systems
 

3057
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,110
because you're describing human systems
mostly right now right I just hope when

3058
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:14,120
mostly right now right I just hope when
 

3059
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,950
mostly right now right I just hope when
there's a monopoly on AGI in one company

3060
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:17,960
there's a monopoly on AGI in one company
 

3061
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:19,590
there's a monopoly on AGI in one company
that we'll see the same thing we see

3062
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:19,600
that we'll see the same thing we see
 

3063
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,030
that we'll see the same thing we see
with humans which is another company

3064
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
with humans which is another company
 

3065
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,629
with humans which is another company
will spring up and start competing I

3066
01:12:23,629 --> 01:12:23,639
will spring up and start competing I
 

3067
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,790
will spring up and start competing I
mean that's been the case so far right

3068
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:25,800
mean that's been the case so far right
 

3069
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,629
mean that's been the case so far right
we have open AI we have anthropic now we

3070
01:12:28,629 --> 01:12:28,639
we have open AI we have anthropic now we
 

3071
01:12:28,639 --> 01:12:29,430
we have open AI we have anthropic now we
have

3072
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:29,440
have
 

3073
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,189
have
xai uh you know we had Meta Even for

3074
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:32,199
xai uh you know we had Meta Even for
 

3075
01:12:32,199 --> 01:12:34,950
xai uh you know we had Meta Even for
open source was and now we have mistol

3076
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:34,960
open source was and now we have mistol
 

3077
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,270
open source was and now we have mistol
right which is highly competitive and so

3078
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
right which is highly competitive and so
 

3079
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,870
right which is highly competitive and so
that's the beauty of capitalism you

3080
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
that's the beauty of capitalism you
 

3081
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,590
that's the beauty of capitalism you
don't have to trust any one party too

3082
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:41,600
don't have to trust any one party too
 

3083
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,390
don't have to trust any one party too
much cuz we're kind of always hedging

3084
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:44,400
much cuz we're kind of always hedging
 

3085
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,310
much cuz we're kind of always hedging
our bets at every level there's always

3086
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
our bets at every level there's always
 

3087
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,310
our bets at every level there's always
competition and that's the most um

3088
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:49,320
competition and that's the most um
 

3089
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,629
competition and that's the most um
beautiful thing to me at least is that

3090
01:12:51,629 --> 01:12:51,639
beautiful thing to me at least is that
 

3091
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:53,470
beautiful thing to me at least is that
the whole system is always shifting

3092
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:53,480
the whole system is always shifting
 

3093
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:55,669
the whole system is always shifting
always adapting and maintaining that

3094
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:55,679
always adapting and maintaining that
 

3095
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,110
always adapting and maintaining that
dynamism is how we avoid tyranny right M

3096
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,120

learning from the study of black holes

3228
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:03,880
learning from the study of black holes
 

3229
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:06,709
learning from the study of black holes
because the entropy of black holes is

3230
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
because the entropy of black holes is
 

3231
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,830
because the entropy of black holes is
very interesting in a sense they're

3232
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:10,840
very interesting in a sense they're
 

3233
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,669
very interesting in a sense they're
physically the most dense objects in the

3234
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:13,679
physically the most dense objects in the
 

3235
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,629
physically the most dense objects in the
universe you can't pack more information

3236
01:16:17,629 --> 01:16:17,639
universe you can't pack more information
 

3237
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:20,030
universe you can't pack more information
spatially any more densely than in black

3238
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:20,040
spatially any more densely than in black
 

3239
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:22,950
spatially any more densely than in black
hole and so I was wondering how do black

3240
01:16:22,950 --> 01:16:22,960
hole and so I was wondering how do black
 

3241
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:23,709

ho

3242
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:23,719
ho
 

3243
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:27,070
ho
actually encode information what is

their compression code and so that got

3246
01:16:29,189 --> 01:16:29,199
their compression code and so that got
 

3247
01:16:29,199 --> 01:16:31,910
their compression code and so that got
me into the space of algorithms to

3248
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:31,920
me into the space of algorithms to
 

3249
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,189
me into the space of algorithms to
search over space of quantum uh codes um

3250
01:16:37,189 --> 01:16:37,199
search over space of quantum uh codes um
 

3251
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,470
search over space of quantum uh codes um
and uh it got me actually into also how

3252
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:40,480
and uh it got me actually into also how
 

3253
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,750
and uh it got me actually into also how
do you acquire Quantum information the

3254
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:42,760
do you acquire Quantum information the
 

3255
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,750
do you acquire Quantum information the
from the world right so something I've

3256
01:16:44,750 --> 01:16:44,760
from the world right so something I've
 

3257
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,110
from the world right so something I've
worked on uh this is public now is

3258
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:48,120
worked on uh this is public now is
 

3259
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,430
worked on uh this is public now is
quantum analog digital conversion so how

3260
01:16:50,430 --> 01:16:50,440
quantum analog digital conversion so how
 

3261
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,590
quantum analog digital conversion so how
do you capture information from The Real

3262
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:53,600
do you capture information from The Real
 

3263
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,709
do you capture information from The Real
World in superposition and not destroy

3264
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:56,719
World in superposition and not destroy
 

3265
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,590
World in superposition and not destroy
the superposition but digitize for a

3266
01:16:59,590 --> 01:16:59,600

computer uh information from The Real
 

3271
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:06,870
computer uh information from The Real
World um and so if you have an ability

3272
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:06,880
World um and so if you have an ability
 

3273
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,390
World um and so if you have an ability
to capture Quantum information and

3274
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:09,400
to capture Quantum information and
 

3275
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,310
to capture Quantum information and
search over learn representations of it

3276
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:13,320
search over learn representations of it
 

3277
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,750

useful information in their latent
 

3283
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:25,270
useful information in their latent
representation right um and I think that

3284
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:25,280
representation right um and I think that
 

3285
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,590
representation right um and I think that
many of the problems facing our

and quantum mechanics is how nature
 

3343
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,590
and quantum mechanics is how nature
behaves at the very small scales when

3344
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:50,600
behaves at the very small scales when
 

3345
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,430
behaves at the very small scales when
things are very small or very cold and

3346
01:18:53,430 --> 01:18:53,440
things are very small or very cold and
 

3347
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,870
things are very small or very cold and
it's actually more fundamental than

3348
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:55,880
it's actually more fundamental than
 

3349
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,390
it's actually more fundamental than
probability Theory so we're used to

3350
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:58,400
probability Theory so we're used to
 

3351
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,229
probability Theory so we're used to
things being this or

3352
01:19:00,229 --> 01:19:00,239
things being this or
 

3353
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:03,750
things being this or
that uh but we're not used to thinking

3354
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:03,760
that uh but we're not used to thinking
 

3355
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,870
that uh but we're not used to thinking
in superpositions because uh well our

3356
01:19:06,870 --> 01:19:06,880
in superpositions because uh well our
 

3357
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,790
in superpositions because uh well our
brains can't can't do that so we we have

3358
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:09,800
brains can't can't do that so we we have
 

3359
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:11,510
brains can't can't do that so we we have
to translate the quantum mechanical

3360
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,520
to translate the quantum mechanical
 

3361
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,390
to translate the quantum mechanical
world to say linear algebra to

3362
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:14,400
world to say linear algebra to
 

3363
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,110
world to say linear algebra to
grocket unfortunately that translation

3364
01:19:17,110 --> 01:19:17,120
grocket unfortunately that translation
 

3365
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:20,070
grocket unfortunately that translation
is exponentially inefficient on average

3366
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:20,080
is exponentially inefficient on average
 

3367
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,870
is exponentially inefficient on average
you have to represent things with very

3368
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:21,880
you have to represent things with very
 

3369
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:23,669
you have to represent things with very
large matrices

3370
01:19:23,669 --> 01:19:23,679
large matrices
 

3371
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:25,430
large matrices
but really you can make a quantum

3372
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:25,440
but really you can make a quantum
 

3373
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,189
but really you can make a quantum
computer out of many things right and

3374
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:27,199
computer out of many things right and
 

3375
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:29,430
computer out of many things right and
we've seen all sorts of players you know

you know stays true to the quantum
 

3429
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,070
you know stays true to the quantum
mechanical aspect of nature yeah it's

01:20:52,229 --> 01:20:52,239
deep learning um alternatively you can
 

3437
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,990
deep learning um alternatively you can
try to do classical machine learning on

3438
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:55,000
try to do classical machine learning on
 

3439
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,990
try to do classical machine learning on
a quantum computer I wouldn't advise it

3440
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
a quantum computer I wouldn't advise it
 

3441
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,229
a quantum computer I wouldn't advise it
because um you may have some speedups

3442
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:01,239
because um you may have some speedups
 

3443
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:05,149
because um you may have some speedups
but very often the speedups come with

3444
01:21:05,149 --> 01:21:05,159
but very often the speedups come with
 

3445
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:07,229
but very often the speedups come with
huge costs using a quantum computer is

3446
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:07,239
huge costs using a quantum computer is
 

3447
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:09,310
huge costs using a quantum computer is
very expensive why is that because you

3448
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:09,320
very expensive why is that because you
 

3449
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,430
very expensive why is that because you
assume the computer is operating at zero

3450
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:12,440
assume the computer is operating at zero
 

3451
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,550
assume the computer is operating at zero
temperature which no physical system in

3452
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
temperature which no physical system in
 

3453
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:16,310
temperature which no physical system in
the universe can achieve that

3454
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:16,320
the universe can achieve that
 

3455
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,110
the universe can achieve that
temperature so what you have to do is

3456
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:18,120
temperature so what you have to do is
 

3457
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:19,669
temperature so what you have to do is
what I've been mentioning this Quantum a

3503
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,950
fundamentally it's any system that has
sufficient uh quantum mechanical uh

3504
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:13,960
sufficient uh quantum mechanical uh
 

3505
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,030
sufficient uh quantum mechanical uh
correlations that are very hard to

3506
01:22:16,030 --> 01:22:16,040
correlations that are very hard to
 

3507
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:19,709
correlations that are very hard to
capture for classical representations

3508
01:22:19,709 --> 01:22:19,719
capture for classical representations
 

3509
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:21,470
capture for classical representations
then there should be an advantage for a

3510
01:22:21,470 --> 01:22:21,480
then there should be an advantage for a
 

3511
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:23,149
then there should be an advantage for a
quantum mechanical represent over a

purely classical one the question is

3514
01:22:25,629 --> 01:22:25,639
purely classical one the question is
 

3515
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:28,790
purely classical one the question is
which systems have sufficient

3516
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
which systems have sufficient
 

3517
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,390
which systems have sufficient
correlations that are very Quantum U but

3518
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:31,400
correlations that are very Quantum U but
 

3519
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,310
correlations that are very Quantum U but
is also uh which systems are still

3520
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:34,320
is also uh which systems are still
 

3521
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,310
is also uh which systems are still
relevant to Industry that's a big

3522
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:36,320
relevant to Industry that's a big
 

3523
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,270
relevant to Industry that's a big
question you know people are leaning

3524
01:22:38,270 --> 01:22:38,280
question you know people are leaning
 

3525
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,270
question you know people are leaning
towards chemistry uh Nuclear

3526
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:41,280
towards chemistry uh Nuclear
 

3527
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,510

Physics uh um I've worked on actually

3528
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:45,520
Physics uh um I've worked on actually
 

3529
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,270
Physics uh um I've worked on actually
processing inputs from Quantum sensors

3530
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:49,280
processing inputs from Quantum sensors
 

3531
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,550
processing inputs from Quantum sensors
right if you have a network of quantum

3532
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:51,560
right if you have a network of quantum
 

3533
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,750
right if you have a network of quantum
sensors they've captured a quantum

3534
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:53,760
sensors they've captured a quantum
 

3535
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:56,310
sensors they've captured a quantum
mechanical image of the world and how to

3536
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:56,320
mechanical image of the world and how to
 

3537
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:58,110
mechanical image of the world and how to
post-process that that becomes a sort of

3538
01:22:58,110 --> 01:22:58,120
post-process that that becomes a sort of
 

3539
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,110
post-process that that becomes a sort of
quantum form of machine perception and

3540
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:00,120
quantum form of machine perception and
 

3541
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:03,390
quantum form of machine perception and
so for example uh fery laab has a

3542
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:03,400
so for example uh fery laab has a
 

3543
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,470
so for example uh fery laab has a
project exploring detecting dark matter

3544
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
project exploring detecting dark matter
 

3545
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:10,350
project exploring detecting dark matter
with these Quantum sensors and to me uh

3546
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:10,360
with these Quantum sensors and to me uh
 

3547
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:12,070
with these Quantum sensors and to me uh
that's in alignment with my quest to

3548
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,080
that's in alignment with my quest to
 

3549
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,550
that's in alignment with my quest to
understand the universe ever since I was

3550
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:13,560
understand the universe ever since I was
 

3551
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,110
understand the universe ever since I was
a child and so someday I hope that we

3552
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:16,120
a child and so someday I hope that we
 

3553
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:18,070
a child and so someday I hope that we
can have very large networks of quantum

3554
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,080
can have very large networks of quantum
 

3555
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,830
can have very large networks of quantum
sensors that help us um peer into the

3556
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:21,840
sensors that help us um peer into the
 

3557
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,470
sensors that help us um peer into the
earliest part of the the universe right

3558
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:24,480
earliest part of the the universe right
 

3559
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,590
earliest part of the the universe right
for example the ligo is a Quantum sensor

3560
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
for example the ligo is a Quantum sensor
 

3561
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,350
for example the ligo is a Quantum sensor
right it's just a very large one um so

3562
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,360
right it's just a very large one um so
 

3563
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,070
right it's just a very large one um so
uh yeah I would say Quantum machine

3564
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:33,080
uh yeah I would say Quantum machine
 

3565
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:36,470
uh yeah I would say Quantum machine

100 page paper have fun um

3620
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,120
100 page paper have fun um
 

3621
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,350
100 page paper have fun um
essentially you you know Quantum

3622
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:39,360
essentially you you know Quantum
 

3623
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,669
essentially you you know Quantum
Computing is usually you embed uh

3624
01:24:42,669 --> 01:24:42,679
Computing is usually you embed uh
 

3625
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:45,990
Computing is usually you embed uh
reversible operations into a Quantum

3626
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,000
reversible operations into a Quantum
 

3627
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,189
reversible operations into a Quantum
computation and so the trick there was

3628
01:24:48,189 --> 01:24:48,199
computation and so the trick there was
 

3629
01:24:48,199 --> 01:24:51,470
computation and so the trick there was
to do a feedforward operation and do

3630
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:51,480
to do a feedforward operation and do
 

3631
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:53,030
to do a feedforward operation and do
what we call a phase kick but really

3632
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,040
what we call a phase kick but really
 

3633
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:55,750
what we call a phase kick but really
it's just a force kick you just kick the

3634
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:55,760
it's just a force kick you just kick the
 

3635
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,430
it's just a force kick you just kick the
system uh with a certain force that is

3636
01:24:59,430 --> 01:24:59,440
system uh with a certain force that is
 

3637
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:01,470
system uh with a certain force that is
you know proportional to your loss

3638
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:01,480
you know proportional to your loss
 

3639
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,830
you know proportional to your loss
function that you you wish to optimize

3640
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:04,840
function that you you wish to optimize
 

3641
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,590
function that you you wish to optimize
and then by performing uncomp

3642
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
and then by performing uncomp
 

3643
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,870
and then by performing uncomp
computation you start with a

3644
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:09,880
computation you start with a
 

3645
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,669
computation you start with a
superpositions over a superposition over

3646
01:25:12,669 --> 01:25:12,679
superpositions over a superposition over
 

3647
01:25:12,679 --> 01:25:15,070
superpositions over a superposition over
parameters right which is pretty funky

3648
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:15,080
parameters right which is pretty funky
 

3649
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:16,870
parameters right which is pretty funky
now you're not just you don't have just

3650
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:16,880
now you're not just you don't have just
 

3651
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,270
now you're not just you don't have just
a point for parameters you have a superp

3652
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:19,280
a point for parameters you have a superp
 

3653
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,430
a point for parameters you have a superp
position over many potential parameters

3654
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:22,440
position over many potential parameters
 

3655
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,390
position over many potential parameters
right mhm and our goal is is using phas

3656
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:25,400
right mhm and our goal is is using phas
 

3657
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:28,350
right mhm and our goal is is using phas
kicks somehow right to adjust parameters

3658
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:28,360
kicks somehow right to adjust parameters
 

3659
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,070
kicks somehow right to adjust parameters
cuz phas kicks

3660
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,080

emulate uh having uh the parameter space

3662
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:34,080
emulate uh having uh the parameter space
 

3663
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,709
emulate uh having uh the parameter space
be like a a particle in N dimensions and

3664
01:25:37,709 --> 01:25:37,719
be like a a particle in N dimensions and
 

3665
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:39,709
be like a a particle in N dimensions and
you're trying to get the shringer

3666
01:25:39,709 --> 01:25:39,719
you're trying to get the shringer
 

3667
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:43,189
you're trying to get the shringer
equation shringer Dynamics in the Lost

landscape of the neural network right

3670
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:45,760
landscape of the neural network right
 

3671
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,189
landscape of the neural network right
and so you do an algorithm to induce the

3672
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:48,199
and so you do an algorithm to induce the
 

3673
01:25:48,199 --> 01:25:50,510
and so you do an algorithm to induce the
space kick which you know involves a

3674
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:50,520
space kick which you know involves a
 

3675
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,669
space kick which you know involves a
feed forward a kick and then when you

3676
01:25:53,669 --> 01:25:53,679
feed forward a kick and then when you
 

3677
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:57,350
feed forward a kick and then when you
uncomp compute the feed forward then all

3678
01:25:57,350 --> 01:25:57,360
uncomp compute the feed forward then all
 

3679
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,990
uncomp compute the feed forward then all
the errors and these phase kicks and

3680
01:25:58,990 --> 01:25:59,000
the errors and these phase kicks and
 

3681
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,070
the errors and these phase kicks and
these forces back propagate and hit each

3682
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:02,080
these forces back propagate and hit each
 

3683
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,669
these forces back propagate and hit each
one of the parameters throughout the

3684
01:26:03,669 --> 01:26:03,679
one of the parameters throughout the
 

3685
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:06,550
one of the parameters throughout the
layers and if you alternate this with an

3686
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:06,560
layers and if you alternate this with an
 

3687
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,189
layers and if you alternate this with an
emulation of kinetic energy then it's

3688
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:10,199
emulation of kinetic energy then it's
 

3689
01:26:10,199 --> 01:26:12,510
emulation of kinetic energy then it's
kind of like a particle moving in N

3690
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:12,520
kind of like a particle moving in N
 

3691
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,470
kind of like a particle moving in N
dimensions a Quantum particle um and the

3692
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:16,480
dimensions a Quantum particle um and the
 

3693
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:18,790
dimensions a Quantum particle um and the
advantage in principle would be that it

3694
01:26:18,790 --> 01:26:18,800
advantage in principle would be that it
 

3695
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,910
advantage in principle would be that it
can tunnel through the landscape um and

3696
01:26:21,910 --> 01:26:21,920
can tunnel through the landscape um and
 

3697
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:24,270
can tunnel through the landscape um and
find new Optima that would have been

3698
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:24,280
find new Optima that would have been
 

3699
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,270
find new Optima that would have been
difficult for stochastic

optimizers um but again this kind of a

3702
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:29,800
optimizers um but again this kind of a
 

3703
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,310
optimizers um but again this kind of a
theoretical thing and in practice uh

3704
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:33,320
theoretical thing and in practice uh
 

3705
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,950

planned uh you know such algorithms
 

3711
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,510

would be extremely expensive to run so
 

3713
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:43,149

you're trying to you're trying to hack
 

3785
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,470
you're trying to you're trying to hack
the world right you're trying to find

01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:06,480
the world right you're trying to find
 

3787
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,510
the world right you're trying to find
how to apply the physics that I know my

things well in Quantum Computing in

3792
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:12,360
things well in Quantum Computing in
 

3793
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:14,510
things well in Quantum Computing in
particular I think there's a just a lot

3794
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:14,520
particular I think there's a just a lot
 

3795
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:16,270
particular I think there's a just a lot
of limits to engineering it just seems

3796
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:16,280
of limits to engineering it just seems
 

3797
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:19,350
of limits to engineering it just seems
to be extremely hard yeah so there's a

3798
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:19,360
to be extremely hard yeah so there's a
 

3799
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,310
to be extremely hard yeah so there's a
lot of value to be uh exploring

3800
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:23,320
lot of value to be uh exploring
 

3801
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,750

overall theme of my company is uh that
we have folks that are uh you know

3820
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:52,920
we have folks that are uh you know
 

3821
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,590
we have folks that are uh you know
there's a sort of Exodus from Quantum

3822
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:54,600
there's a sort of Exodus from Quantum
 

3823
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,629
there's a sort of Exodus from Quantum
Computing and we're going to broader

3824
01:28:56,629 --> 01:28:56,639
Computing and we're going to broader
 

3825
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:58,790

physics based AI that is not Quantum so

3826
01:28:58,790 --> 01:28:58,800
physics based AI that is not Quantum so
 

3827
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:00,910
physics based AI that is not Quantum so
that gives you a hint and um so we

3828
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:00,920
that gives you a hint and um so we
 

3829
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,270
that gives you a hint and um so we
should say the name of your company is

3830
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:02,280
should say the name of your company is
 

3831
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:20,910
should say the name of your company is

3835
01:29:22,679 --> 01:29:24,910

and the way to do that is by encoding

3836
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:24,920
and the way to do that is by encoding
 

3837
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,430
and the way to do that is by encoding
information you encode a code within a

3838
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:27,440
information you encode a code within a
 

3839
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:31,350
information you encode a code within a
code within a code within a code and so

3840
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:31,360
code within a code within a code and so
 

3841
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:35,070
code within a code within a code and so
there's a lot of redundancy needed to do

3842
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:35,080
there's a lot of redundancy needed to do
 

3843
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:37,750
there's a lot of redundancy needed to do
this error correction But ultimately

this error correction But ultimately
 

3845
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,390
this error correction But ultimately
it's a sort of um algorithmic

3846
01:29:41,390 --> 01:29:41,400
it's a sort of um algorithmic
 

3847
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,390
it's a sort of um algorithmic

01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:00,239
your quantum mechanical program it's
 

3861
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,070
your quantum mechanical program it's
very difficult because in order to scale

very difficult because in order to scale
up your quantum computer you need each

3864
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:06,040
up your quantum computer you need each
 

3865
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,910
up your quantum computer you need each
component to be of sufficient quality

3866

for it to be worth it because if you try
 

3869
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,669
for it to be worth it because if you try
to do this error correction this Quantum

3870
01:30:12,669 --> 01:30:12,679
to do this error correction this Quantum
 

3871

3874
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:17,320
Quantum bit and your control over them
 

3875
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:20,950
Quantum bit and your control over them
is if it's insufficient um uh it's not

3876
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:20,960
is if it's insufficient um uh it's not
 

3877
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,430
is if it's insufficient um uh it's not
worth scaling up your actually adding

3878
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:22,440
worth scaling up your actually adding
 

3879
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,350
worth scaling up your actually adding
more errors than you remove and so

3880
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:24,360
more errors than you remove and so
 

3881
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,270
more errors than you remove and so
there's this notion of a threshold where

3882
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,280
there's this notion of a threshold where
 

3883
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:29,229
there's this notion of a threshold where
if your Quantum bits are of sufficient

3884
01:30:29,229 --> 01:30:29,239
if your Quantum bits are of sufficient
 

3885
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:30,709
if your Quantum bits are of sufficient
quality in terms of your control over

3886
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
quality in terms of your control over
 

3887
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:33,030
quality in terms of your control over
them it's actually worth scaling up and

3888
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,040
them it's actually worth scaling up and
 

3889
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,149
them it's actually worth scaling up and
actually in recent years people have

3890
01:30:35,149 --> 01:30:35,159
actually in recent years people have
 

3891
01:30:35,159 --> 01:30:37,350
actually in recent years people have
been crossing the threshold and it's

3892
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:37,360
been crossing the threshold and it's
 

3893
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,070
been crossing the threshold and it's
starting to be worth it and so it's just

3894
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:39,080
starting to be worth it and so it's just
 

3895
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:42,669
starting to be worth it and so it's just
a very long slog of engineering But

3896
01:30:42,669 --> 01:30:42,679
a very long slog of engineering But
 

3897
01:30:42,679 --> 01:30:44,830
a very long slog of engineering But
ultimately it's really crazy to me how

3898
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:44,840
ultimately it's really crazy to me how
 

3899
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,030
ultimately it's really crazy to me how
much Exquisite level of control we have

3900
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:47,040
much Exquisite level of control we have
 

3901
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,149
much Exquisite level of control we have
over these systems it's actually quite

3902
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:50,159
over these systems it's actually quite
 

3903
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:54,350
over these systems it's actually quite
crazy uh and and we're people are

3904
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:54,360
crazy uh and and we're people are
 

3905
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,149
crazy uh and and we're people are
crossing you know they're achieving

3906
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:56,159
crossing you know they're achieving
 

3907
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:59,350
crossing you know they're achieving

3908
01:30:59,350 --> 01:30:59,360

too much hype it's good for fundraising

3914
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:05,679
too much hype it's good for fundraising
 

3915
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:08,590
too much hype it's good for fundraising
but sometimes you know it causes Winters

3916
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:08,600
but sometimes you know it causes Winters
 

3917
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,109
but sometimes you know it causes Winters
right it's the hype cycle I'm bullish on

3918
01:31:11,109 --> 01:31:11,119
right it's the hype cycle I'm bullish on

01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:17,400
scale uh personally but I think there's
 

3923
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:19,669
scale uh personally but I think there's

01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:02,800
I've had to think about um I think that
 

3959
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:04,590
I've had to think about um I think that

01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,229
during my masters I was trying to
understand the energy and entanglement

01:32:26,840 --> 01:32:29,830
to say and our equations of
cosmology don't match our calculations

01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:29,840
cosmology don't match our calculations

01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,229
cosmology don't match our calculations
for the amount of quantum energy there

3978
01:32:32,229 --> 01:32:32,239
for the amount of quantum energy there
 

3979
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:34,149
for the amount of quantum energy there
are there is in the

3980
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:34,159
are there is in the
 

3981
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:37,590
are there is in the
fluctuations and so I was trying to hack

3982
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:37,600
fluctuations and so I was trying to hack
 

3983
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,830
fluctuations and so I was trying to hack
the energy of the vacuum right and the

3984
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:40,840
the energy of the vacuum right and the
 

3985
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,149
the energy of the vacuum right and the
reality is that you can't just directly

3986
01:32:43,149 --> 01:32:43,159
reality is that you can't just directly
 

3987
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:45,149
reality is that you can't just directly
hack it it doesn't it's not technically

3988
01:32:45,149 --> 01:32:45,159
hack it it doesn't it's not technically
 

3989
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:47,629
hack it it doesn't it's not technically
free energy your lack of knowledge of

3990
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:47,639
free energy your lack of knowledge of
 

3991
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:50,229
free energy your lack of knowledge of
the fluctuations means you can't extract

3992
01:32:50,229 --> 01:32:50,239
the fluctuations means you can't extract
 

3993
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,550
the fluctuations means you can't extract
the energy but just like you know in the

3994
01:32:52,550 --> 01:32:52,560
the energy but just like you know in the
 

3995
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,030
the energy but just like you know in the
stock market if you have a stock that's

3996
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:54,040
stock market if you have a stock that's
 

3997
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:56,189
stock market if you have a stock that's
correlated over time the vacuum is

3998
01:32:56,189 --> 01:32:56,199
correlated over time the vacuum is
 

3999
01:32:56,199 --> 01:32:58,709
correlated over time the vacuum is
actually correlated so if you measured

4000
01:32:58,709 --> 01:32:58,719
actually correlated so if you measured
 

4001
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:01,790
actually correlated so if you measured
the vacuum at one point you acquired

4002
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:01,800
the vacuum at one point you acquired
 

4003
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,550
the vacuum at one point you acquired
information if you communicated that

4004
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:03,560
information if you communicated that
 

4005
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:07,430
information if you communicated that
information to another point you can

4006
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:07,440
information to another point you can
 

4007
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,390
information to another point you can
infer uh what configuration the vacuum

4008
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:10,400
infer uh what configuration the vacuum
 

4009
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,790
infer uh what configuration the vacuum
is in to some precision and

4019
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,750

01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,109
could try to imagine that they're
they're around and and how would they

um go faster than the speed of light you
 

4061
01:34:19,159 --> 01:34:20,910
um go faster than the speed of light you

01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:29,390
College try trying to hack the energy of
the vacuum and hit the limits allowable

4068
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:29,400
the vacuum and hit the limits allowable
 

4069
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:32,790
the vacuum and hit the limits allowable
by the laws of physics but um there's

4070
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:32,800
by the laws of physics but um there's
 

4071
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,510
by the laws of physics but um there's
all sorts of caveat there where uh you

4072
01:34:36,510 --> 01:34:36,520
all sorts of caveat there where uh you
 

4073
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,189
all sorts of caveat there where uh you
can't extract more than you've you've

4074
01:34:39,189 --> 01:34:39,199
can't extract more than you've you've
 

4075
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:42,950
can't extract more than you've you've
put in obviously but you're saying it's

4076
01:34:42,950 --> 01:34:42,960
put in obviously but you're saying it's
 

4077
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:44,990
put in obviously but you're saying it's
possible to teleport the energy because

4078
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:45,000
possible to teleport the energy because
 

4079
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,510
possible to teleport the energy because
you

4080
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:47,520

 

4081
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:50,470

can extract information one

4082
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:50,480
can extract information one
 

4083
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:53,629
can extract information one
place and then make based on that some

4084
01:34:53,629 --> 01:34:53,639
place and then make based on that some
 

4085
01:34:53,639 --> 01:34:56,790
place and then make based on that some
kind of prediction about another place

4086
01:34:56,790 --> 01:34:56,800
kind of prediction about another place
 

4087
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,910
kind of prediction about another place
I'm not sure what I make of that yeah I

4088
01:34:58,910 --> 01:34:58,920
I'm not sure what I make of that yeah I
 

4089
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,950
I'm not sure what I make of that yeah I
mean it's it's uh allowable by the laws

4090
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:00,960
mean it's it's uh allowable by the laws
 

4091
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:02,629
mean it's it's uh allowable by the laws
of physics the the reality though is

4092
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
of physics the the reality though is
 

4093
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,629
of physics the the reality though is
that the correlations Decay with

4094
01:35:04,629 --> 01:35:04,639
that the correlations Decay with
 

4095
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:07,189
that the correlations Decay with
distance and so you're going to have to

4096
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:07,199
distance and so you're going to have to
 

4097
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,430
distance and so you're going to have to
pay the price not too far away from

4098
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
pay the price not too far away from
 

4099
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,189
pay the price not too far away from
where you extract it sure right the

4100
01:35:11,189 --> 01:35:11,199
where you extract it sure right the
 

4101
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:13,430
where you extract it sure right the

what most people have read on the the
 

4147
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:15,510
what most people have read on the the

topic um I think it's interesting to
 

4149
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:19,550

we don't get disrupted right whether
it's a form of of AI that disrupts us or

01:36:35,990 --> 01:36:36,000
it's a form of of AI that disrupts us or

01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:10,990
humans so to me the thought experiment
is say the aliens are here or they are

that come into my
 

4293
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:16,430
that come into my
head like what do you have you H how do

4294
01:39:16,430 --> 01:39:16,440
head like what do you have you H how do

you know that how do you know that the
 

4297
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:20,709

what's the origin of ideas in your mind

4298
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:20,719
what's the origin of ideas in your mind
 

4299
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:23,390
what's the origin of ideas in your mind
when idea comes to your head show me

4300
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:23,400
when idea comes to your head show me
 

4301
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:24,229
when idea comes to your head show me
where it

4302
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
where it
 

4303
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,629
where it
originates I mean

4304
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:26,639
originates I mean
 

4305
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,950
originates I mean
frankly uh when I had the idea for the

4306
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:29,960
frankly uh when I had the idea for the
 

4307
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,589
frankly uh when I had the idea for the
type of computer I'm building now I

4308
01:39:31,589 --> 01:39:31,599
type of computer I'm building now I
 

4309
01:39:31,599 --> 01:39:33,709
type of computer I'm building now I
think it was eight years ago now it

4310
01:39:33,709 --> 01:39:33,719
think it was eight years ago now it
 

4311
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:35,070
think it was eight years ago now it
really felt like it was being beamed

4312

really felt like it was being beamed
 

4313
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:36,109
really felt like it was being beamed
from

01:39:36,119 --> 01:39:39,109
from
space just I was in bed just shaking

01:39:39,109 --> 01:39:39,119
space just I was in bed just shaking
 

4317
01:39:39,119 --> 01:39:40,629
space just I was in bed just shaking
just thinking it through and I don't

4318
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:40,639
just thinking it through and I don't
 

4319
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,910
just thinking it through and I don't
know uh but do I believe that

4320
01:39:42,910 --> 01:39:42,920
know uh but do I believe that
 

4321
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,390
know uh but do I believe that
legitimately I don't think so I but you

4322
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:45,400
legitimately I don't think so I but you
 

4323
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:49,589
legitimately I don't think so I but you
know I I think that um alien life could

4324
01:39:49,589 --> 01:39:49,599
know I I think that um alien life could
 

4325
01:39:49,599 --> 01:39:51,350
know I I think that um alien life could
take many forms and I think the notion

4326
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:51,360
take many forms and I think the notion
 

4327
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,870
take many forms and I think the notion
of intelligence and the notion of Life

4328
01:39:53,870 --> 01:39:53,880
of intelligence and the notion of Life
 

4329
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,350
of intelligence and the notion of Life
needs to be expanded uh much more

and the fact that this sort of Duality
 

4363
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:52,669
and the fact that this sort of Duality
comes from trying to

01:40:52,669 --> 01:40:52,679
comes from trying to
 

4365
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:55,870

to apply Quantum machine learning to uh

4374
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:07,400
to apply Quantum machine learning to uh
 

4375
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:11,550
to apply Quantum machine learning to uh
these sorts of systems these cfts or uh

4376
01:41:11,550 --> 01:41:11,560
these sorts of systems these cfts or uh
 

4377
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:14,950
these sorts of systems these cfts or uh
they're called syk models um and learn

an emergent geometry from from the
 

4381
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:19,629
an emergent geometry from from the
boundary Theory and so we can have a

4382
01:41:19,629 --> 01:41:19,639
boundary Theory and so we can have a
 

4383
01:41:19,639 --> 01:41:21,910
boundary Theory and so we can have a
form of machine learning

4384

form of machine learning
 

4385
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:23,910

helps us to help
 

4387
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,990
helps us to help
us understand quantum gravity right

4388
01:41:26,990 --> 01:41:27,000
us understand quantum gravity right
 

4389
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,350

01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:52,470
they're at the inter interface between
quantum mechanics and gravity and so

4410
01:41:52,470 --> 01:41:52,480
quantum mechanics and gravity and so
 

4411
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:55,910
quantum mechanics and gravity and so
they help us test all sorts of ideas um

4412
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:55,920
they help us test all sorts of ideas um

01:42:45,830 --> 01:42:45,840
infinitely as it gets closer and closer
 

4447
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:48,910
infinitely as it gets closer and closer
and so everything that is falling to a

4448
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:48,920
and so everything that is falling to a
 

4449
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,750
and so everything that is falling to a
black hole from our perspective gift s

4450
01:42:50,750 --> 01:42:50,760
black hole from our perspective gift s
 

4451
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:53,950
black hole from our perspective gift s
sort of sedimented and tacked on to the

4452
01:42:53,950 --> 01:42:53,960
sort of sedimented and tacked on to the
 

4453
01:42:53,960 --> 01:42:56,430
sort of sedimented and tacked on to the
near Horizon and at some point it gets

4454
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:56,440
near Horizon and at some point it gets
 

4455
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,109
near Horizon and at some point it gets
so close to the Horizon it's

4456
01:42:58,109 --> 01:42:58,119
so close to the Horizon it's
 

4457
01:42:58,119 --> 01:43:01,430
so close to the Horizon it's
in the proximity or the scale which in

4458
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:01,440
in the proximity or the scale which in
 

4459
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,950
in the proximity or the scale which in
which Quantum effects and Quantum

4460
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:02,960
which Quantum effects and Quantum
 

4461
01:43:02,960 --> 01:43:08,790
which Quantum effects and Quantum
fluctuations matter and there some that

4462
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:08,800
fluctuations matter and there some that
 

4463
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:11,189
fluctuations matter and there some that
and falling matter could interfere with

4464
01:43:11,189 --> 01:43:11,199
and falling matter could interfere with
 

4465
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:13,510
and falling matter could interfere with
sort of the traditional pictures that it

4466
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:13,520
sort of the traditional pictures that it
 

4467
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,510
sort of the traditional pictures that it
could interfere with the creation and

4468
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:15,520
could interfere with the creation and
 

4469
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:16,870
could interfere with the creation and
annihilation of particles and

4470
01:43:16,870 --> 01:43:16,880
annihilation of particles and
 

4471
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,790
annihilation of particles and
antiparticles in the vacuum and through

4472
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:19,800
antiparticles in the vacuum and through
 

4473
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,669
antiparticles in the vacuum and through
this interference

4474
01:43:21,669 --> 01:43:21,679
this interference
 

4475
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:23,910
this interference
uh one of the particles gets entangled

4476
01:43:23,910 --> 01:43:23,920
uh one of the particles gets entangled
 

4477
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,870
uh one of the particles gets entangled
with the infalling information and one

4478
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:25,880
with the infalling information and one
 

4479
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:28,189
with the infalling information and one
of them is now free and escapes and

4480
01:43:28,189 --> 01:43:28,199
of them is now free and escapes and
 

4481
01:43:28,199 --> 01:43:30,470
of them is now free and escapes and
that's how there's sort of mutual

4482
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:30,480
that's how there's sort of mutual
 

4483
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,510
that's how there's sort of mutual
information between the outgoing

4484
01:43:33,510 --> 01:43:33,520
information between the outgoing
 

4485
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:36,070
information between the outgoing
radiation and the infalling matter uh

4486
01:43:36,070 --> 01:43:36,080
radiation and the infalling matter uh
 

4487
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:38,470
radiation and the infalling matter uh
but getting that calculation right I

4488
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:38,480
but getting that calculation right I
 

4489
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:41,870
but getting that calculation right I
think we're only just starting to uh put

4490
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:41,880
think we're only just starting to uh put
 

4491
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:44,350
think we're only just starting to uh put
the pieces together um there's a few

4492
01:43:44,350 --> 01:43:44,360
the pieces together um there's a few
 

4493
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,470
the pieces together um there's a few
pothead like questions I want to ask you

4494
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:46,480
pothead like questions I want to ask you
 

4495
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:48,870
pothead like questions I want to ask you
sure so one does it terrify you that

4496
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:48,880
sure so one does it terrify you that
 

4497
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,990
sure so one does it terrify you that
there's a giant black hole the center of

4498
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:51,000
there's a giant black hole the center of
 

4499
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,870
there's a giant black hole the center of
our galaxy I don't know I I I just want

4500
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:53,880
our galaxy I don't know I I I just want
 

4501
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:56,629
our galaxy I don't know I I I just want
to you know set up shop near it to to

4502
01:43:56,629 --> 01:43:56,639
to you know set up shop near it to to
 

4503
01:43:56,639 --> 01:43:59,790
to you know set up shop near it to to
fast forward you know meet the meet a

4504
01:43:59,790 --> 01:43:59,800
fast forward you know meet the meet a
 

4505
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,430
fast forward you know meet the meet a
future civilization right like if we

4506
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:02,440
future civilization right like if we
 

4507
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,310
future civilization right like if we
have a limited lifetime if you could go

4508
01:44:04,310 --> 01:44:04,320
have a limited lifetime if you could go
 

4509
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:08,030
have a limited lifetime if you could go
orbit a black hole and emerge uh so if

4510
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:08,040
orbit a black hole and emerge uh so if
 

4511
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,430
orbit a black hole and emerge uh so if
you were like if there was a special

4512
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:09,440
you were like if there was a special
 

4513
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:10,709
you were like if there was a special
mission that could take you to Black

4514
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:10,719
mission that could take you to Black
 

4515
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,229
mission that could take you to Black
Hole would you volunteer to go travel to

4516
01:44:13,229 --> 01:44:13,239
Hole would you volunteer to go travel to
 

4517
01:44:13,239 --> 01:44:15,550
Hole would you volunteer to go travel to
orbit and not obviously not fall into it

4518
01:44:15,550 --> 01:44:15,560
orbit and not obviously not fall into it
 

4519
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:17,390
orbit and not obviously not fall into it
that's that's obvious so it's obvious to

4520
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:17,400
that's that's obvious so it's obvious to
 

4521
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,950
that's that's obvious so it's obvious to
you that everything's destroyed inside a

4522
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960
you that everything's destroyed inside a
 

4523
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:20,709
you that everything's destroyed inside a
black hole like all the information

4524
01:44:20,709 --> 01:44:20,719
black hole like all the information
 

4525
01:44:20,719 --> 01:44:23,830
black hole like all the information
makes up Gom is destroyed um maybe on

4526
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:23,840
makes up Gom is destroyed um maybe on
 

4527
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:27,070
makes up Gom is destroyed um maybe on
the other side bef jil's emerges and

4528
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:27,080
the other side bef jil's emerges and
 

4529
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:30,109
the other side bef jil's emerges and
it's all like is tied together in some

4530
01:44:30,109 --> 01:44:30,119
it's all like is tied together in some
 

4531
01:44:30,119 --> 01:44:33,470
it's all like is tied together in some
deeply mimaal way yeah I mean that's a

4532
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:33,480
deeply mimaal way yeah I mean that's a
 

4533
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:36,109
deeply mimaal way yeah I mean that's a
great question we we have to

4534
01:44:36,109 --> 01:44:36,119
great question we we have to
 

4535
01:44:36,119 --> 01:44:39,510
great question we we have to
answer what black holes are are they are

4536
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:39,520
answer what black holes are are they are
 

4537
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,350
answer what black holes are are they are
we punching a hole through SpaceTime and

4538
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:41,360
we punching a hole through SpaceTime and
 

4539
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:44,470
we punching a hole through SpaceTime and
creating a pocket Universe it's possible

4540
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:44,480
creating a pocket Universe it's possible
 

4541
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:47,270
creating a pocket Universe it's possible
right then then that would mean that if

4542
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,280
right then then that would mean that if
 

4543
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,109
right then then that would mean that if
we Ascend the cev scale to you know

4544
01:44:50,109 --> 01:44:50,119
we Ascend the cev scale to you know
 

4545
01:44:50,119 --> 01:44:54,589
we Ascend the cev scale to you know
beyond CF type 3 we could engineer black

4546
01:44:54,589 --> 01:44:54,599
beyond CF type 3 we could engineer black
 

4547
01:44:54,599 --> 01:44:56,550
beyond CF type 3 we could engineer black
holes with specific hyperparameters to

4548
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:56,560
holes with specific hyperparameters to
 

4549
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,030
holes with specific hyperparameters to
transmit information to new universes we

4550
01:44:59,030 --> 01:44:59,040
transmit information to new universes we
 

4551
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,990
transmit information to new universes we
create and so we can have progyny right

4552
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:03,000
create and so we can have progyny right
 

4553
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,910
create and so we can have progyny right
uh that are new universes and so we even

4554
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:05,920
uh that are new universes and so we even
 

4555
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:08,950
uh that are new universes and so we even
though our universe may reach a heat

4556
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:08,960
though our universe may reach a heat
 

4557
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:13,350
though our universe may reach a heat
death we may have a way to have a legacy

4558
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:13,360
death we may have a way to have a legacy
 

4559
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,470
death we may have a way to have a legacy
right so we don't know yet we need to

4560
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:16,480
right so we don't know yet we need to
 

4561
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:18,270
right so we don't know yet we need to
ascend the cter shf scale to answer

4562
01:45:18,270 --> 01:45:18,280
ascend the cter shf scale to answer
 

4563
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:22,149
ascend the cter shf scale to answer
these questions right to appear into

4564
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:22,159
these questions right to appear into
 

4565
01:45:22,159 --> 01:45:25,189
these questions right to appear into
that regime of higher energy physics and

4566
01:45:25,189 --> 01:45:25,199
that regime of higher energy physics and
 

4567
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:27,229
that regime of higher energy physics and
maybe you can uh speak to the CF scale

4568
01:45:27,229 --> 01:45:27,239
maybe you can uh speak to the CF scale
 

4569
01:45:27,239 --> 01:45:29,149
maybe you can uh speak to the CF scale
for people who don't know so one one of

4570
01:45:29,149 --> 01:45:29,159
for people who don't know so one one of
 

4571
01:45:29,159 --> 01:45:34,750
for people who don't know so one one of
the uh sort of mem likee principles and

4572
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:34,760
the uh sort of mem likee principles and
 

4573
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:37,870
the uh sort of mem likee principles and
goals of uh the eak movement is to

4574
01:45:37,870 --> 01:45:37,880
goals of uh the eak movement is to
 

4575
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,950
goals of uh the eak movement is to
ascend The Carter shf scale what is the

4576
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:39,960
ascend The Carter shf scale what is the
 

4577
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:42,149
ascend The Carter shf scale what is the
cter chef scale and when do we want to

4578
01:45:42,149 --> 01:45:42,159
cter chef scale and when do we want to
 

4579
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:45,030
cter chef scale and when do we want to
ascend it the Carter Chef scale is a

4580
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:45,040
ascend it the Carter Chef scale is a
 

4581
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:48,470
ascend it the Carter Chef scale is a
measure of our energy production and

4582
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:48,480
measure of our energy production and
 

4583
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:51,950
measure of our energy production and
consumption um and really it's a

4584
01:45:51,950 --> 01:45:51,960
consumption um and really it's a
 

4585
01:45:51,960 --> 01:45:55,950
consumption um and really it's a
logarithmic scale and CEF type one is a

4586
01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:55,960
logarithmic scale and CEF type one is a
 

4587
01:45:55,960 --> 01:45:59,550
logarithmic scale and CEF type one is a
milestone where we are producing the

4588
01:45:59,550 --> 01:45:59,560
milestone where we are producing the
 

4589
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,030
milestone where we are producing the
equivalent wattage to all the energy

4590
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:02,040
equivalent wattage to all the energy
 

4591
01:46:02,040 --> 01:46:04,350
equivalent wattage to all the energy
that is incident on earth from the sun

4592
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:04,360
that is incident on earth from the sun
 

4593
01:46:04,360 --> 01:46:07,109
that is incident on earth from the sun
cter Chef type 2 would be harnessing all

4594
01:46:07,109 --> 01:46:07,119
cter Chef type 2 would be harnessing all
 

4595
01:46:07,119 --> 01:46:09,950
cter Chef type 2 would be harnessing all
the energy that is output by the Sun and

4596
01:46:09,950 --> 01:46:09,960
the energy that is output by the Sun and
 

4597
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:12,310
the energy that is output by the Sun and
I think type three is like the whole

4598
01:46:12,310 --> 01:46:12,320
I think type three is like the whole
 

4599
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:15,189
I think type three is like the whole

01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:23,000
believe in those but um to me it seems
 

4607
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,750

like from the first principles of
thermodynamics that again this there's

4610

thermodynamics that again this there's
 

4611
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,030
thermodynamics that again this there's
this concept of

on Earth because we have this sort of
 

4619
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,790
on Earth because we have this sort of
energetic drive from the sun right we

energetic drive from the sun right we
 

4621
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,709

4629
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:57,430
that free energy to maintain itself and

so mimetic optimism virus so you do want
 

4743
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,390
so mimetic optimism virus so you do want
it to be a virus to to maximize the

01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:38,430
it to be a virus to to maximize the
spread and uh is Hypes therefore the

4747
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:42,030

adding too many regulations slowing
things down and so it's kind of we're

4842
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:53,920
things down and so it's kind of we're
 

4843
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,870
things down and so it's kind of we're
trying to bring balance to the force

at the edge of criticality between Order
 

4859
01:52:14,199 --> 01:52:17,229
at the edge of criticality between Order
and Chaos right between

equilibrate balance these two things and

4866
01:52:24,550 --> 01:52:24,560
equilibrate balance these two things and
 

4867
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,870
equilibrate balance these two things and
so I thought that the balance was

4868
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:26,880
so I thought that the balance was
 

4869
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,189
so I thought that the balance was
lacking and so we created this movement

4870
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
lacking and so we created this movement
 

4871
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:33,629
lacking and so we created this movement
to to bring balance well I like how I I

4872

communism is a fork of that and then the

communism is a fork of that and then the
 

4887
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:57,310

all of them there's many variants as
 

4955
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:33,910
all of them there's many variants as
well um and so you know if there's a

01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:33,920
well um and so you know if there's a
 

4957

right like um for example we talk about
 

5027
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:12,270
right like um for example we talk about
thermodynamics being our God right um

5028
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:12,280
thermodynamics being our God right um
 

5029
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:14,510
thermodynamics being our God right um
and sometimes we do cult-like things but

5030
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:14,520
and sometimes we do cult-like things but
 

5031
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,790
and sometimes we do cult-like things but
there's no like ceremony and and robes

there's no like ceremony and and robes
 

5033
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:21,030
there's no like ceremony and and robes
and whatnot uh so not yet

5034
01:56:21,030 --> 01:56:21,040
and whatnot uh so not yet
 

5035
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:22,870
and whatnot uh so not yet
uh but ultimately yeah I I mean I

5036
01:56:22,870 --> 01:56:22,880
uh but ultimately yeah I I mean I
 

5037
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,189
uh but ultimately yeah I I mean I
totally agree that it seems to me that

5038
01:56:26,189 --> 01:56:26,199
totally agree that it seems to me that
 

5039
01:56:26,199 --> 01:56:28,470
totally agree that it seems to me that
humans want to feel like they're part of

5040
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:28,480
humans want to feel like they're part of
 

5041
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:32,390
humans want to feel like they're part of
a group so they naturally try to agree

5042
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:32,400
a group so they naturally try to agree
 

5043
01:56:32,400 --> 01:56:34,430
a group so they naturally try to agree
with their neighbors and and find common

5044
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:34,440
with their neighbors and and find common
 

5045
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:37,189
with their neighbors and and find common
ground and and that leads to sort of

5046
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:37,199
ground and and that leads to sort of
 

5047
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:39,550
ground and and that leads to sort of
mode collapse in the space of ideas

5048
01:56:39,550 --> 01:56:39,560
mode collapse in the space of ideas
 

5049
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:42,870
mode collapse in the space of ideas
right we used to have sort of one

5050
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:42,880
right we used to have sort of one
 

5051
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,470
right we used to have sort of one
cultural uh Island that was allowed it

5052
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:45,480
cultural uh Island that was allowed it
 

5053
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:47,270
cultural uh Island that was allowed it
was a typical Subspace of thought and

5054
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:47,280
was a typical Subspace of thought and
 

5055
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,470
was a typical Subspace of thought and
anything that was diverting from that

5056
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:49,480
anything that was diverting from that
 

5057
01:56:49,480 --> 01:56:51,189
anything that was diverting from that
Subspace of thought was suppressed or

5058
01:56:51,189 --> 01:56:51,199
Subspace of thought was suppressed or
 

5059
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:53,069
Subspace of thought was suppressed or
you were canceled right now we've

5060
01:56:53,069 --> 01:56:53,079
you were canceled right now we've
 

5061
01:56:53,079 --> 01:56:55,350
you were canceled right now we've
created a new mode but the whole point

5062
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:55,360
created a new mode but the whole point
 

5063
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,589
created a new mode but the whole point
is that we're not trying to have very

5064
01:56:57,589 --> 01:56:57,599
is that we're not trying to have very
 

5065
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:00,149
is that we're not trying to have very
restricted space of thought there's not

5066
01:57:00,149 --> 01:57:00,159
restricted space of thought there's not
 

5067
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:01,830
restricted space of thought there's not
just one way to think about eak and its

5068
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:01,840
just one way to think about eak and its
 

5069
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:04,069
just one way to think about eak and its
many forks and and the point is that

5070
01:57:04,069 --> 01:57:04,079
many forks and and the point is that
 

5071
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:05,629
many forks and and the point is that
there are many forks and there can be

5072
01:57:05,629 --> 01:57:05,639
there are many forks and there can be
 

5073
01:57:05,639 --> 01:57:07,950
there are many forks and there can be
many clusters and many islands and I

5074
01:57:07,950 --> 01:57:07,960
many clusters and many islands and I
 

5075
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:10,870
many clusters and many islands and I
shouldn't be in control of it uh in any

5076
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:10,880
shouldn't be in control of it uh in any
 

5077
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,750
shouldn't be in control of it uh in any
way uh I mean there's no formal org uh

5078
01:57:14,750 --> 01:57:14,760
way uh I mean there's no formal org uh
 

5079
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:18,149
way uh I mean there's no formal org uh
whatsoever uh I just put out uh tweets

5080
01:57:18,149 --> 01:57:18,159
whatsoever uh I just put out uh tweets
 

5081
01:57:18,159 --> 01:57:21,189
whatsoever uh I just put out uh tweets
and and uh certain blog posts and people

5082
01:57:21,189 --> 01:57:21,199
and and uh certain blog posts and people
 

5083
01:57:21,199 --> 01:57:24,470
and and uh certain blog posts and people
are free to defect and Fork if there's

5084
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:24,480
are free to defect and Fork if there's
 

5085
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,790
are free to defect and Fork if there's
an aspect they don't like and so that

5086
01:57:26,790 --> 01:57:26,800
an aspect they don't like and so that
 

5087
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:29,830
an aspect they don't like and so that
makes it so that there should be a sort

5088
01:57:29,830 --> 01:57:29,840
makes it so that there should be a sort
 

5089
01:57:29,840 --> 01:57:32,709
makes it so that there should be a sort
of deter deterritorialization in the

5090
01:57:32,709 --> 01:57:32,719
of deter deterritorialization in the
 

5091
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:35,270
of deter deterritorialization in the
space of ideas so that we don't end up

5092
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:35,280
space of ideas so that we don't end up
 

5093
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:38,870
space of ideas so that we don't end up
in one cluster that's very cult-like um

5094
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:38,880
in one cluster that's very cult-like um
 

5095
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:42,069
in one cluster that's very cult-like um
and so Cults usually the they don't they

5096
01:57:42,069 --> 01:57:42,079
and so Cults usually the they don't they
 

5097
01:57:42,079 --> 01:57:44,069
and so Cults usually the they don't they
don't allow people to defect or start

5098
01:57:44,069 --> 01:57:44,079
don't allow people to defect or start
 

5099
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:46,830
don't allow people to defect or start
competing Forks whereas we encourage it

5100
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:46,840
competing Forks whereas we encourage it
 

5101
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:50,870
competing Forks whereas we encourage it
right do you think just the humor

5102
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:50,880
right do you think just the humor
 

5103
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,030
right do you think just the humor
the pros and cons of humor and

the pros and cons of humor and
 

5105
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:57,149
the pros and cons of humor and
meme so in some sense

5106
01:57:57,149 --> 01:57:57,159
meme so in some sense
 

5107
01:57:57,159 --> 01:58:00,830
meme so in some sense
meme there's like a wisdom to

5108
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:00,840
meme there's like a wisdom to
 

5109
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:04,189
meme there's like a wisdom to
memes um what is it the Magic Theater

5110
01:58:04,189 --> 01:58:04,199
memes um what is it the Magic Theater
 

5111
01:58:04,199 --> 01:58:07,149
memes um what is it the Magic Theater
what book is that from Harman has a um

5112
01:58:07,149 --> 01:58:07,159
what book is that from Harman has a um
 

5113
01:58:07,159 --> 01:58:10,310
what book is that from Harman has a um
steppen wolf I think but there there's

5114
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:10,320
steppen wolf I think but there there's
 

5115
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:14,189
steppen wolf I think but there there's
a there's a kind of embracing of the

5116
01:58:14,189 --> 01:58:14,199
a there's a kind of embracing of the
 

5117
01:58:14,199 --> 01:58:16,550
a there's a kind of embracing of the
absurdity that seems to get to the truth

5118
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:16,560
absurdity that seems to get to the truth
 

5119
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,830
absurdity that seems to get to the truth
of things but at the same time it can

5120
01:58:18,830 --> 01:58:18,840
of things but at the same time it can
 

5121
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:21,669
of things but at the same time it can
also decrease the quality and the rigor

5122
01:58:21,669 --> 01:58:21,679
also decrease the quality and the rigor
 

5123
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:24,149
also decrease the quality and the rigor
of the discourse yeah do you feel the

5124
01:58:24,149 --> 01:58:24,159
of the discourse yeah do you feel the
 

5125
01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:27,950
of the discourse yeah do you feel the
tension of that yeah so initially I

5126
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:27,960
tension of that yeah so initially I
 

5127
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:30,510
tension of that yeah so initially I
think what allowed us to grow under the

5128
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:30,520
think what allowed us to grow under the
 

5129
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:33,589
think what allowed us to grow under the
radar was because it was camouflaged as

5130
01:58:33,589 --> 01:58:33,599
radar was because it was camouflaged as
 

5131
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:36,750
radar was because it was camouflaged as
sort of meta ironic right we would sneak

5132
01:58:36,750 --> 01:58:36,760
sort of meta ironic right we would sneak
 

5133
01:58:36,760 --> 01:58:40,430
sort of meta ironic right we would sneak
in you know I deep truths within a

5134
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:40,440
in you know I deep truths within a
 

5135
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:43,790
in you know I deep truths within a
package of humor and humor and memes and

5136
01:58:43,790 --> 01:58:43,800
package of humor and humor and memes and
 

5137
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:47,510
package of humor and humor and memes and
what are called shit posts right um and

5138
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:47,520
what are called shit posts right um and
 

5139
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,189
what are called shit posts right um and
I think that was purposefully a sort of

5140
01:58:51,189 --> 01:58:51,199
I think that was purposefully a sort of
 

5141
01:58:51,199 --> 01:58:56,030
I think that was purposefully a sort of
camouflage against those that um seek

5142
01:58:56,030 --> 01:58:56,040
camouflage against those that um seek
 

5143
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:59,910
camouflage against those that um seek
status and do not want to it's very hard

5144
01:58:59,910 --> 01:58:59,920
status and do not want to it's very hard
 

5145
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:03,750
status and do not want to it's very hard
to argue with a cartoon frog or

5146
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:03,760
to argue with a cartoon frog or
 

5147
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:07,350
to argue with a cartoon frog or
a a a cartoon of an Intergalactic Jeff

5148
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:07,360
a a a cartoon of an Intergalactic Jeff
 

5149
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:10,589
a a a cartoon of an Intergalactic Jeff
Bezos um and take yourself seriously

5150
01:59:10,589 --> 01:59:10,599
Bezos um and take yourself seriously
 

5151
01:59:10,599 --> 01:59:13,069
Bezos um and take yourself seriously
yeah and so that allowed allowed us to

5152
01:59:13,069 --> 01:59:13,079
yeah and so that allowed allowed us to
 

5153
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:16,390
yeah and so that allowed allowed us to
grow uh pretty rapidly in the early days

5154
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:16,400
grow uh pretty rapidly in the early days
 

5155
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:20,149
grow uh pretty rapidly in the early days
but um of course like that's

5156
01:59:20,149 --> 01:59:20,159
but um of course like that's
 

5157
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:23,950
but um of course like that's
you know essentially people get steered

5158
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:23,960
you know essentially people get steered
 

5159
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:26,189
you know essentially people get steered
their notion of the truth comes from the

5160
01:59:26,189 --> 01:59:26,199
their notion of the truth comes from the
 

5161
01:59:26,199 --> 01:59:28,589
their notion of the truth comes from the
data they see from from the information

5162
01:59:28,589 --> 01:59:28,599
data they see from from the information
 

5163
01:59:28,599 --> 01:59:30,910
data they see from from the information
they're fed and the information people

5164
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:30,920
they're fed and the information people
 

5165
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:34,069
they're fed and the information people
are fed is determined by algorithms

5166
01:59:34,069 --> 01:59:34,079
are fed is determined by algorithms
 

5167
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:37,229
are fed is determined by algorithms
right and really what we've been doing

5168
01:59:37,229 --> 01:59:37,239
right and really what we've been doing
 

5169
01:59:37,239 --> 01:59:41,229
right and really what we've been doing
is sort of uh engineering what we call

5170
01:59:41,229 --> 01:59:41,239
is sort of uh engineering what we call
 

5171
01:59:41,239 --> 01:59:43,910
is sort of uh engineering what we call
High mimetic Fitness uh packets of

5172
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:43,920
High mimetic Fitness uh packets of
 

5173
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,669
High mimetic Fitness uh packets of
information so that they can spread

5174
01:59:45,669 --> 01:59:45,679
information so that they can spread
 

5175
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:47,910
information so that they can spread
effectively and carry a message right so

5176
01:59:47,910 --> 01:59:47,920
effectively and carry a message right so
 

5177
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:50,229
effectively and carry a message right so
it's it's kind of a

5178
01:59:50,229 --> 01:59:50,239
it's it's kind of a
 

5179
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:52,589
it's it's kind of a
a vector to Spread spread the message

5180
01:59:52,589 --> 01:59:52,599
a vector to Spread spread the message
 

5181
01:59:52,599 --> 01:59:55,550
a vector to Spread spread the message
and and yes we've been using sort of

5182
01:59:55,550 --> 01:59:55,560
and and yes we've been using sort of
 

5183
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:58,149
and and yes we've been using sort of
techniques that are optimal for for

5184
01:59:58,149 --> 01:59:58,159
techniques that are optimal for for
 

5185
01:59:58,159 --> 02:00:00,270
techniques that are optimal for for
today's algorithmically Amplified

5186
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:00,280
today's algorithmically Amplified
 

5187
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:03,550
today's algorithmically Amplified
information Landscapes um but I think

5188
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:03,560
information Landscapes um but I think
 

5189
02:00:03,560 --> 02:00:05,790
information Landscapes um but I think
we're reaching the point of you know

5190
02:00:05,790 --> 02:00:05,800
we're reaching the point of you know
 

5191
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:08,790
we're reaching the point of you know
scale where we can have serious debates

5192
02:00:08,790 --> 02:00:08,800
scale where we can have serious debates
 

5193
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:11,669
scale where we can have serious debates
and serious conversations and um you

5194
02:00:11,669 --> 02:00:11,679
and serious conversations and um you
 

5195
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:13,990
and serious conversations and um you
know that's why we're considering doing

5196
02:00:13,990 --> 02:00:14,000
know that's why we're considering doing
 

5197
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,430
know that's why we're considering doing
a bunch of uh debates and having more

5198
02:00:16,430 --> 02:00:16,440
a bunch of uh debates and having more
 

5199
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:18,510
a bunch of uh debates and having more
serious long form discussions because I

5200
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:18,520
serious long form discussions because I
 

5201
02:00:18,520 --> 02:00:20,069
serious long form discussions because I
don't think that

5202
02:00:20,069 --> 02:00:20,079
don't think that
 

5203
02:00:20,079 --> 02:00:22,310
don't think that
um the timeline is optimal for sort of

5204
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:22,320
um the timeline is optimal for sort of
 

5205
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:24,189
um the timeline is optimal for sort of
very serious thoughtful discussions and

5206
02:00:24,189 --> 02:00:24,199
very serious thoughtful discussions and
 

5207
02:00:24,199 --> 02:00:28,109
very serious thoughtful discussions and
get you get rewarded for sort of uh

5208
02:00:28,109 --> 02:00:28,119
get you get rewarded for sort of uh
 

5209
02:00:28,119 --> 02:00:31,430
get you get rewarded for sort of uh
polarization right and so um even though

5210
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:31,440
polarization right and so um even though
 

5211
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:33,629
polarization right and so um even though
we started a movement that is literally

5212
02:00:33,629 --> 02:00:33,639
we started a movement that is literally
 

5213
02:00:33,639 --> 02:00:36,270
we started a movement that is literally
trying to polarize the the tech

5214
02:00:36,270 --> 02:00:36,280
trying to polarize the the tech
 

5215
02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:38,550
trying to polarize the the tech
ecosystem um at the end of the day so

5216
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:38,560
ecosystem um at the end of the day so
 

5217
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:40,790
ecosystem um at the end of the day so
that we can have a conversation and find

5218
02:00:40,790 --> 02:00:40,800
that we can have a conversation and find
 

5219
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:43,149
that we can have a conversation and find
an Optimum together I mean that's kind

5220
02:00:43,149 --> 02:00:43,159
an Optimum together I mean that's kind
 

5221
02:00:43,159 --> 02:00:45,189
an Optimum together I mean that's kind
of what I try to do with this podcast

5222
02:00:45,189 --> 02:00:45,199
of what I try to do with this podcast
 

5223
02:00:45,199 --> 02:00:47,310
of what I try to do with this podcast
given the landscape of things to still

5224
02:00:47,310 --> 02:00:47,320

best of all time unarguably uh and of
 

5301
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:34,550
best of all time unarguably uh and of
course the the work at Blue origin

02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:34,560
course the the work at Blue origin
 

5303
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:37,189
course the the work at Blue origin
similar to the work at SpaceX is trying

5304
02:02:37,189 --> 02:02:37,199
similar to the work at SpaceX is trying
 

5305
02:02:37,199 --> 02:02:38,750
similar to the work at SpaceX is trying
to make humans and multiplanetary

5306
02:02:38,750 --> 02:02:38,760
to make humans and multiplanetary
 

5307

02:02:40,149 --> 02:02:40,159
species
 

5309
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:42,870
species
which seems almost like a bigger thing

5310
02:02:42,870 --> 02:02:42,880
which seems almost like a bigger thing
 

5311
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:45,390
which seems almost like a bigger thing
than the capitalist machine or it's a

5312
02:02:45,390 --> 02:02:45,400
than the capitalist machine or it's a

capitalist machine at a different time
 

5315
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:50,790

scale perhaps yeah I I think that um you

5316
02:02:50,790 --> 02:02:50,800
scale perhaps yeah I I think that um you
 

5317
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,229
scale perhaps yeah I I think that um you
know companies they tend to optimize you

5318
02:02:54,229 --> 02:02:54,239
know companies they tend to optimize you
 

5319
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,750
know companies they tend to optimize you
know quarter over quarter maybe a few

5320
02:02:56,750 --> 02:02:56,760
know quarter over quarter maybe a few
 

5321
02:02:56,760 --> 02:02:59,030
know quarter over quarter maybe a few
years out but individuals that want to

02:02:59,030 --> 02:02:59,040
years out but individuals that want to
 

5323
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:02,350
years out but individuals that want to
leave a legacy can think on a

5324
02:03:02,350 --> 02:03:02,360
leave a legacy can think on a
 

5325
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:04,510
leave a legacy can think on a
multi-decadal or multi-century time

looking you know elon's doing this
 

5339
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:21,830
looking you know elon's doing this
with SpaceX putting all this Capital

5340
02:03:21,830 --> 02:03:21,840
with SpaceX putting all this Capital

towards getting us to Mars um uh Jeff is

5342
02:03:24,870 --> 02:03:24,880
towards getting us to Mars um uh Jeff is
 

5343
02:03:24,880 --> 02:03:27,390
towards getting us to Mars um uh Jeff is
trying to build blue origin and I think

5344
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:27,400
trying to build blue origin and I think
 

5345
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,189
trying to build blue origin and I think
he wants to build O'Neal cylinders and

5346
02:03:29,189 --> 02:03:29,199
he wants to build O'Neal cylinders and
 

5347
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:31,709
he wants to build O'Neal cylinders and
get industry off Planet uh which I think

5348
02:03:31,709 --> 02:03:31,719
get industry off Planet uh which I think
 

5349
02:03:31,719 --> 02:03:35,430
get industry off Planet uh which I think
is brilliant um I think you know just

5350
02:03:35,430 --> 02:03:35,440
is brilliant um I think you know just
 

5351
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:38,669
is brilliant um I think you know just
overall I'm I'm for billionaires I know

5352
02:03:38,669 --> 02:03:38,679
overall I'm I'm for billionaires I know
 

5353
02:03:38,679 --> 02:03:40,550
overall I'm I'm for billionaires I know
this controversial statement sometimes

5354
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:40,560
this controversial statement sometimes
 

5355
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:43,310
this controversial statement sometimes
but I think that uh in a sense it's kind

5356
02:03:43,310 --> 02:03:43,320
but I think that uh in a sense it's kind
 

5357
02:03:43,320 --> 02:03:47,149
but I think that uh in a sense it's kind
of a a proof of stake voting right like

5358
02:03:47,149 --> 02:03:47,159
of a a proof of stake voting right like
 

5359
02:03:47,159 --> 02:03:49,510
of a a proof of stake voting right like
if you've acquire if you've allocated

5360
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:49,520
if you've acquire if you've allocated
 

5361
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:52,510
if you've acquire if you've allocated
Capital efficiently you get you unlock

5362
02:03:52,510 --> 02:03:52,520
Capital efficiently you get you unlock
 

5363
02:03:52,520 --> 02:03:55,390
Capital efficiently you get you unlock
more Capital to allocate just because

5364
02:03:55,390 --> 02:03:55,400
more Capital to allocate just because
 

5365
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:58,549
more Capital to allocate just because
clearly you know how to allocate Capital

5366
02:03:58,549 --> 02:03:58,559
clearly you know how to allocate Capital
 

5367
02:03:58,559 --> 02:04:00,830
clearly you know how to allocate Capital
more efficiently which is in contrast to

5368
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:00,840
more efficiently which is in contrast to
 

5369
02:04:00,840 --> 02:04:03,870
more efficiently which is in contrast to
politicians that get elected because

5370
02:04:03,870 --> 02:04:03,880
politicians that get elected because
 

5371
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:06,069
politicians that get elected because
they speak the best on TV right not

5372
02:04:06,069 --> 02:04:06,079
they speak the best on TV right not
 

5373
02:04:06,079 --> 02:04:07,950
they speak the best on TV right not
because they have a proven track record

5374
02:04:07,950 --> 02:04:07,960
because they have a proven track record
 

5375
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:10,790
because they have a proven track record
of allocating taxpayer Capital most

5376
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:10,800
of allocating taxpayer Capital most
 

5377
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:14,709
of allocating taxpayer Capital most
efficiently and so that's why I'm for uh

5378
02:04:14,709 --> 02:04:14,719
efficiently and so that's why I'm for uh
 

5379
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:17,589
efficiently and so that's why I'm for uh
capitalism uh over say giving all our

5380
02:04:17,589 --> 02:04:17,599
capitalism uh over say giving all our
 

5381
02:04:17,599 --> 02:04:18,990
capitalism uh over say giving all our

02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:50,709
researchers that uh make key discoveries
that push us forward right uh including

5694
02:10:50,709 --> 02:10:50,719
that push us forward right uh including
 

5695
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:54,030
that push us forward right uh including
discoveries for AI safety and so I think

5696
02:10:54,030 --> 02:10:54,040
discoveries for AI safety and so I think
 

5697
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:55,870
discoveries for AI safety and so I think
I I just want to maintain ubiquity of

5698
02:10:55,870 --> 02:10:55,880
I I just want to maintain ubiquity of
 

5699
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:58,189
I I just want to maintain ubiquity of
opportunity to contribute to Ai and and

5700
02:10:58,189 --> 02:10:58,199
opportunity to contribute to Ai and and
 

5701
02:10:58,199 --> 02:11:00,629
opportunity to contribute to Ai and and
to own a piece of the future right it

5702
02:11:00,629 --> 02:11:00,639
to own a piece of the future right it
 

5703
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:02,030
to own a piece of the future right it
can't just be

5704
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:02,040
can't just be
 

5705
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:04,589
can't just be

there's a question in there but how
 

5731
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,350
there's a question in there but how
important to you and what you've seen

safety is AI
 

5737
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:46,229

safety I think again I think like if

5738
02:11:46,229 --> 02:11:46,239
safety I think again I think like if
 

5739
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:48,470
safety I think again I think like if
there was no one working on it I think I

5740
02:11:48,470 --> 02:11:48,480
there was no one working on it I think I
 

5741
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:51,470
there was no one working on it I think I
would be a proponent sure of it I think

5742
02:11:51,470 --> 02:11:51,480
would be a proponent sure of it I think
 

5743
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:53,229
would be a proponent sure of it I think
again our goal is to sort of bring

5744
02:11:53,229 --> 02:11:53,239
again our goal is to sort of bring
 

5745
02:11:53,239 --> 02:11:57,589
again our goal is to sort of bring
balance and obviously a sense of urgency

5746
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:57,599
balance and obviously a sense of urgency
 

5747
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:00,430
balance and obviously a sense of urgency
is a useful tool right to make uh

5748
02:12:00,430 --> 02:12:00,440
is a useful tool right to make uh
 

5749
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:03,270

progress it hacks our dopaminergic
 

5751
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:06,830
progress it hacks our dopaminergic
systems and gives us energy to to work

5752
02:12:06,830 --> 02:12:06,840

5753
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:10,189
systems and gives us energy to to work
late into the night I think also having

5754
02:12:10,189 --> 02:12:10,199
late into the night I think also having

02:12:10,199 --> 02:12:11,950
late into the night I think also having
a higher purpose you're contributing to

5757
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:13,549
a higher purpose you're contributing to
right at the end of the day it's like

5758
02:12:13,549 --> 02:12:13,559
right at the end of the day it's like
 

5759
02:12:13,559 --> 02:12:14,709
right at the end of the day it's like
what am I contributing to I'm

beautiful machine so that we
 

5765
02:12:18,960 --> 02:12:20,470
beautiful machine so that we
seek to the Stars that's really

5766
02:12:20,470 --> 02:12:20,480

uh hack so you're saying AI safety is

5770
02:12:27,549 --> 02:12:27,559
uh hack so you're saying AI safety is
 

5771
02:12:27,559 --> 02:12:29,950
uh hack so you're saying AI safety is
important to you but right now the

5772
02:12:29,950 --> 02:12:29,960
important to you but right now the
 

5773
02:12:29,960 --> 02:12:33,310
important to you but right now the
landscape of ideas you see is AI safety

5774
02:12:33,310 --> 02:12:33,320
landscape of ideas you see is AI safety
 

5775
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:36,069
landscape of ideas you see is AI safety
as a topic is used more often to gain

5776
02:12:36,069 --> 02:12:36,079
as a topic is used more often to gain
 

5777
02:12:36,079 --> 02:12:39,030
as a topic is used more often to gain
centralized control so in that sense

5778
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:39,040
centralized control so in that sense
 

5779
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:41,350
centralized control so in that sense
you're resisting it as a proxy for

5780
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:41,360
you're resisting it as a proxy for
 

5781
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:43,669
you're resisting it as a proxy for
centralized gaining centralized control

5782
02:12:43,669 --> 02:12:43,679
centralized gaining centralized control
 

5783
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:47,270
centralized gaining centralized control
yeah I I I I just think we we have to be

5784
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:47,280
yeah I I I I just think we we have to be
 

5785
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:52,109
yeah I I I I just think we we have to be
careful because um you know safety is

5786
02:12:52,109 --> 02:12:52,119
careful because um you know safety is
 

5787
02:12:52,119 --> 02:12:55,549
careful because um you know safety is
just the perfect cover for sort of

5793
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:01,669
eventually corruption I don't I'm not
saying it's corrupted now but it could

02:13:01,669 --> 02:13:01,679
saying it's corrupted now but it could
 

5795
02:13:01,679 --> 02:13:05,069
saying it's corrupted now but it could
be uh down the line and

5796
02:13:05,069 --> 02:13:05,079
be uh down the line and
 

5797
02:13:05,079 --> 02:13:07,310
be uh down the line and
really if you if you let the argument

5798
02:13:07,310 --> 02:13:07,320
really if you if you let the argument
 

5799
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:10,629
really if you if you let the argument
run like there's no amount of sort of

like having a global

of interesting physics things so what

5848
02:14:09,870 --> 02:14:09,880
of interesting physics things so what
 

5849
02:14:09,880 --> 02:14:11,030
of interesting physics things so what
what are you up to over there that you

5850
02:14:11,030 --> 02:14:11,040
what are you up to over there that you
 

5851
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:11,990
what are you up to over there that you
can talk

5852
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:12,000
can talk
 

5853
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,549
can talk
about yeah I mean you know originally we

5854
02:14:14,549 --> 02:14:14,559
about yeah I mean you know originally we
 

5855
02:14:14,559 --> 02:14:17,390
about yeah I mean you know originally we
weren't going to announce last week uh

5856
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:17,400
weren't going to announce last week uh
 

5857
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,669
weren't going to announce last week uh
but I think with uh the doxing in

5858
02:14:19,669 --> 02:14:19,679
but I think with uh the doxing in
 

5859
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:22,030
but I think with uh the doxing in
disclosure we got our our hand forced so

5860
02:14:22,030 --> 02:14:22,040
disclosure we got our our hand forced so
 

5861
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:24,229
disclosure we got our our hand forced so
we we had to disclose roughly what we

5862
02:14:24,229 --> 02:14:24,239
we we had to disclose roughly what we
 

5863
02:14:24,239 --> 02:14:26,589
we we had to disclose roughly what we
we're doing but really ex stopic was

5864
02:14:26,589 --> 02:14:26,599
we're doing but really ex stopic was
 

5865
02:14:26,599 --> 02:14:30,510
we're doing but really ex stopic was
born from my dissatisfaction and and

5866
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:30,520
born from my dissatisfaction and and
 

5867

02:14:46,109 --> 02:14:46,119
commercially scale and I was working on
 

5879
02:14:46,119 --> 02:14:47,950
commercially scale and I was working on
physics based AI that runs on these

physics based AI that runs on these
 

5881
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:51,109

02:14:58,629 --> 02:14:58,639
as I mention you have to constantly pump
 

5889
02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:00,790
as I mention you have to constantly pump
out the noise out of the system to

out the noise out of the system to
 

5891
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:03,830
out the noise out of the system to
maintain this pristine environment where

that constraint was just too much it's

5896
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:08,360
that constraint was just too much it's
 

5897
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:10,030
that constraint was just too much it's
too costly to do

too costly to do
 

5899
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:14,390
too costly to do
that and so we were wondering right as

5900
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:14,400
that and so we were wondering right as
 

5901
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:17,430
that and so we were wondering right as

than you and the idea was that in the

6006
02:17:46,950 --> 02:17:46,960
than you and the idea was that in the
 

6007
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:48,750
than you and the idea was that in the
early days of Quantum Computing you can

6008
02:17:48,750 --> 02:17:48,760
early days of Quantum Computing you can
 

6009
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:52,150
early days of Quantum Computing you can
only run short Quantum programs and so

6010
02:17:52,150 --> 02:17:52,160
only run short Quantum programs and so
 

6011
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:54,429
only run short Quantum programs and so
which Quantum programs should you run

6012
02:17:54,429 --> 02:17:54,439
which Quantum programs should you run
 

6013
02:17:54,439 --> 02:17:56,589
which Quantum programs should you run
well just let gradient descend find

6014
02:17:56,589 --> 02:17:56,599
well just let gradient descend find
 

6015
02:17:56,599 --> 02:17:59,309
well just let gradient descend find
those programs instead and so we built

6016
02:17:59,309 --> 02:17:59,319
those programs instead and so we built
 

6017
02:17:59,319 --> 02:18:01,070
those programs instead and so we built
sort of the first

6018
02:18:01,070 --> 02:18:01,080
sort of the first
 

6019
02:18:01,080 --> 02:18:04,230
sort of the first
infrastructure uh to not only run

6020
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:04,240
infrastructure uh to not only run
 

6021
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:06,389
infrastructure uh to not only run
differentiable Quantum programs but

6022
02:18:06,389 --> 02:18:06,399

6023
02:18:06,399 --> 02:18:09,830
differentiable Quantum programs but
combine them as part of broader deep

6024
02:18:09,830 --> 02:18:09,840
combine them as part of broader deep
 

6025
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:12,589
combine them as part of broader deep

incorporating deep neural networks you

6028
02:18:15,110 --> 02:18:15,120
incorporating deep neural networks you
 

6029
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:17,150
incorporating deep neural networks you
know the ones you know and love with

what are called called Quantum neural
 

6033
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:24,549
what are called called Quantum neural
networks um and uh ultimately it was a

6034
02:18:24,549 --> 02:18:24,559
networks um and uh ultimately it was a
 

6035
02:18:24,559 --> 02:18:26,589
networks um and uh ultimately it was a
very cross-disciplinary effort we had to

6036
02:18:26,589 --> 02:18:26,599
very cross-disciplinary effort we had to
 

6037
02:18:26,599 --> 02:18:28,549
very cross-disciplinary effort we had to
invent all sorts of ways to

through the graph the hybrid graph um

6042
02:18:33,830 --> 02:18:33,840
through the graph the hybrid graph um
 

6043
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:36,589
through the graph the hybrid graph um
but ultimately it taught me that you the

6044
02:18:36,589 --> 02:18:36,599
but ultimately it taught me that you the
 

6045
02:18:36,599 --> 02:18:38,469
but ultimately it taught me that you the

02:19:44,629 --> 02:19:44,639
teaching one another right I learned a
 

6097
02:19:44,639 --> 02:19:46,309
teaching one another right I learned a
lot of software engineering through the

6098
02:19:46,309 --> 02:19:46,319
lot of software engineering through the
 

6099
02:19:46,319 --> 02:19:48,589
lot of software engineering through the
process um uh my colleagues learned a

6100
02:19:48,589 --> 02:19:48,599
process um uh my colleagues learned a
 

6101
02:19:48,599 --> 02:19:51,710
process um uh my colleagues learned a
lot of quantum physics and some learned

6102
02:19:51,710 --> 02:19:51,720
lot of quantum physics and some learned
 

6103
02:19:51,720 --> 02:19:53,590
lot of quantum physics and some learned
machine learning through the process of

6104

machine learning through the process of
 

6105
02:19:53,600 --> 02:19:58,389
machine learning through the process of
of building this uh system and I think

6106
02:19:58,389 --> 02:19:58,399
of building this uh system and I think
 

6107
02:19:58,399 --> 02:20:00,190
of building this uh system and I think
if you get some smart people that are

6108
02:20:00,190 --> 02:20:00,200
if you get some smart people that are
 

6109
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,990
if you get some smart people that are
passionate and trust each other in a

6110
02:20:01,990 --> 02:20:02,000
passionate and trust each other in a
 

6111
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,670
passionate and trust each other in a
room and you have a small team and you

6112
02:20:04,670 --> 02:20:04,680
room and you have a small team and you
 

6113
02:20:04,680 --> 02:20:07,429
room and you have a small team and you
teach each other your Specialties

6114
02:20:07,429 --> 02:20:07,439
teach each other your Specialties
 

6115
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:08,990
teach each other your Specialties
suddenly you're kind of forming this

6116
02:20:08,990 --> 02:20:09,000
suddenly you're kind of forming this
 

6117
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,630
suddenly you're kind of forming this
sort of model soup of expertise and

6118
02:20:12,630 --> 02:20:12,640
sort of model soup of expertise and
 

6119
02:20:12,640 --> 02:20:14,830
sort of model soup of expertise and
something special comes out of that

6120
02:20:14,830 --> 02:20:14,840
something special comes out of that
 

6121
02:20:14,840 --> 02:20:17,429
something special comes out of that
right it's like combining genes but for

6122
02:20:17,429 --> 02:20:17,439
right it's like combining genes but for
 

6123
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:20,230
right it's like combining genes but for
your knowledge bases and uh sometimes

6124
02:20:20,230 --> 02:20:20,240
your knowledge bases and uh sometimes
 

6125
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:22,030
your knowledge bases and uh sometimes
special products come out of that and so

6126
02:20:22,030 --> 02:20:22,040
special products come out of that and so
 

6127
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:24,110
special products come out of that and so
I I think like even though it's very

6128
02:20:24,110 --> 02:20:24,120
I I think like even though it's very
 

6129
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:26,389
I I think like even though it's very
high friction initially to work in an

6130
02:20:26,389 --> 02:20:26,399
high friction initially to work in an
 

6131
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:28,910
high friction initially to work in an
interdisciplinary team I think the

6132
02:20:28,910 --> 02:20:28,920
interdisciplinary team I think the
 

6133
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:30,710
interdisciplinary team I think the
product at the end of the day is is is

6134
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:30,720
product at the end of the day is is is
 

6135
02:20:30,720 --> 02:20:33,349
product at the end of the day is is is
worth it and so learned a lot trying to

6136
02:20:33,349 --> 02:20:33,359
worth it and so learned a lot trying to
 

6137
02:20:33,359 --> 02:20:35,030
worth it and so learned a lot trying to
bridge the gap there and I mean it's

6138
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,040
bridge the gap there and I mean it's
 

6139
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,030
bridge the gap there and I mean it's
still a challenge to this day you know

6140
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:37,040
still a challenge to this day you know
 

6141
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,510
still a challenge to this day you know
we hire folks that are have an AI

have to make them talk to one another

6148
02:20:46,349 --> 02:20:46,359
have to make them talk to one another
 

6149
02:20:46,359 --> 02:20:49,190
have to make them talk to one another
right is there magic is there some

building a team that uh can create Magic
 

6155
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:58,990
building a team that uh can create Magic
together yeah it's it's really hard to

6164
02:21:10,550 --> 02:21:10,560
Canadian so oh you are legitimately
 

6165
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:12,270
Canadian so oh you are legitimately
French can I am I thought you were just

6166

French can I am I thought you were just
 

6167
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:15,309
French can I am I thought you were just
doing that for the for the for the cred

6168
02:21:15,309 --> 02:21:15,319
doing that for the for the for the cred
 

6169
02:21:15,319 --> 02:21:17,550
doing that for the for the for the cred
no no no I'm truly French Canadian from

6170
02:21:17,550 --> 02:21:17,560
no no no I'm truly French Canadian from
 

6171
02:21:17,560 --> 02:21:22,710
no no no I'm truly French Canadian from
from Montreal um um but yeah essentially

6172
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:22,720
from Montreal um um but yeah essentially
 

6173
02:21:22,720 --> 02:21:25,270
from Montreal um um but yeah essentially
we look for people with very high fluid

6174
02:21:25,270 --> 02:21:25,280
we look for people with very high fluid

6177
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:28,309
intelligence that aren't over
specialized because they're going to

6178
02:21:28,309 --> 02:21:28,319
specialized because they're going to
 

6179
02:21:28,319 --> 02:21:29,710
specialized because they're going to
have to get out of their comfort zone

6180
02:21:29,710 --> 02:21:29,720
have to get out of their comfort zone
 

6181
02:21:29,720 --> 02:21:31,230
have to get out of their comfort zone
they're going to have to incorporate

6182
02:21:31,230 --> 02:21:31,240
they're going to have to incorporate
 

6183
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:33,990
they're going to have to incorporate
Concepts that they've never seen before

6184
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:34,000
Concepts that they've never seen before
 

6185
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,710
Concepts that they've never seen before
and very quickly get comfortable with

6186
02:21:35,710 --> 02:21:35,720
and very quickly get comfortable with
 

6187
02:21:35,720 --> 02:21:38,150
and very quickly get comfortable with
them right or or learn to work in a team

and so that's sort of uh what we look

6190
02:21:40,950 --> 02:21:40,960
and so that's sort of uh what we look
 

6191
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:43,710
and so that's sort of uh what we look
for when we hire we can't hire you know

02:24:23,560 --> 02:24:28,030
humanlike systems so on that topic what
do you I suppose that is one of the big

02:24:28,030 --> 02:24:28,040
do you I suppose that is one of the big
 

6323

models to you is that they're not

6326
02:24:32,670 --> 02:24:32,680
models to you is that they're not

02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:44,910
that be fair to say yeah no I I you
wouldn't you know try to extrapolate the

6341
02:24:49,319 --> 02:24:50,750
from the internet right it's not going
to be a very accurate model it's not

02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:50,760
to be a very accurate model it's not
 

6343
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:52,750
to be a very accurate model it's not
going to model its priors or its

it's more like up versus down in terms

6444
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:00,800
it's more like up versus down in terms
 

6445
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:04,389
it's more like up versus down in terms

6447
02:27:04,399 --> 02:27:09,030

um but it seems to be like there is a

6448
02:27:09,030 --> 02:27:09,040
um but it seems to be like there is a
 

6449
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:10,910
um but it seems to be like there is a
sort of case of alignment of the

sort of case of alignment of the

that are for more centralization of

6457
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,950
power control and more
regulations uh are Alig with sort of

6458
02:27:21,950 --> 02:27:21,960
regulations uh are Alig with sort of
 

6459
02:27:21,960 --> 02:27:23,990
regulations uh are Alig with sort of
aligning themselves with the doomers

6460
02:27:23,990 --> 02:27:24,000

because that sort of uh instilling fear

6462
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:27,359
because that sort of uh instilling fear
 

6463
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:30,030
because that sort of uh instilling fear
in people is a great way to for them to

6464
02:27:30,030 --> 02:27:30,040
in people is a great way to for them to
 

6465
02:27:30,040 --> 02:27:31,429
in people is a great way to for them to
give up more control and give the

6466
02:27:31,429 --> 02:27:31,439
give up more control and give the
 

6467
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:34,630
give up more control and give the
government more power but fundamentally

6468

02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:39,550
we're not left versus right I think
there's we've done polls of um people's

6472
02:27:39,550 --> 02:27:39,560
there's we've done polls of um people's
 

6473
02:27:39,560 --> 02:27:41,190
there's we've done polls of um people's
alignment with an EAC I think it's

6475
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:44,190
alignment with an EAC I think it's
pretty balanced um so it's a it's a new

02:27:44,190 --> 02:27:44,200
pretty balanced um so it's a it's a new

just centralizing ation versus
 

6481
02:27:47,279 --> 02:27:50,110
just centralizing ation versus
decentralization it's kind of do we go

02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:50,120
decentralization it's kind of do we go
 

6483
02:27:50,120 --> 02:27:51,870
decentralization it's kind of do we go
it's like Tech progressivism versus

02:27:51,870 --> 02:27:51,880
it's like Tech progressivism versus

actually say and sorry to interrupt we
 

6509
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:27,510
actually say and sorry to interrupt we
should probably say that and you can

02:28:27,510 --> 02:28:27,520
should probably say that and you can
 

6511
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:29,429

probably measured something like the
amount of suffering in the world you

6522
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:40,560
amount of suffering in the world you
 

6523
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:41,870
amount of suffering in the world you
want to minimize

6524
02:28:41,870 --> 02:28:41,880
want to minimize
 

6525
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:46,150
want to minimize
it and uh there's ways that that can go

6526
02:28:46,150 --> 02:28:46,160
it and uh there's ways that that can go
 

6527
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:48,830
it and uh there's ways that that can go
wrong as any optimization can and so

6528
02:28:48,830 --> 02:28:48,840
wrong as any optimization can and so
 

6529
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:50,389

explore
 

6533
02:28:52,080 --> 02:28:55,750

uh like how things can go wrong we're

6534
02:28:55,750 --> 02:28:55,760
uh like how things can go wrong we're
 

6535
02:28:55,760 --> 02:28:57,590
uh like how things can go wrong we're
we're both trying to do good to some

6536
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:57,600
we're both trying to do good to some
 

6537
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:00,630
we're both trying to do good to some
extent and we're we're both trying we're

6538
02:29:00,630 --> 02:29:00,640
extent and we're we're both trying we're
 

6539

we're arguing for which loss function we

02:29:03,030 --> 02:29:03,040
we're arguing for which loss function we
 

6541
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:05,230
we're arguing for which loss function we
should use right yes their loss function

6542
02:29:05,230 --> 02:29:05,240
should use right yes their loss function
 

6543
02:29:05,240 --> 02:29:08,150
should use right yes their loss function
is sort of Hons right uh units of

6544
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:08,160
is sort of Hons right uh units of
 

6545
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:11,750
is sort of Hons right uh units of
Hedonism like how how like how good do

6546
02:29:11,750 --> 02:29:11,760
Hedonism like how how like how good do
 

6547
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:14,550
Hedonism like how how like how good do
you feel and for how much time right and

6548
02:29:14,550 --> 02:29:14,560
you feel and for how much time right and
 

6549
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:17,790
you feel and for how much time right and
so suffering would be negative heatons

6550
02:29:17,790 --> 02:29:17,800
so suffering would be negative heatons
 

6551
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:19,870
so suffering would be negative heatons
um and they're trying to minimize that

6552
02:29:19,870 --> 02:29:19,880
um and they're trying to minimize that
 

6553
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:23,269
um and they're trying to minimize that
but to us that seems like uh that loss

6554
02:29:23,269 --> 02:29:23,279
but to us that seems like uh that loss
 

6555
02:29:23,279 --> 02:29:25,190
but to us that seems like uh that loss
function has sort of spirous Minima

6556
02:29:25,190 --> 02:29:25,200
function has sort of spirous Minima
 

6557
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:27,950

02:29:27,950 --> 02:29:27,960
right you can um you know start
 

6559
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:31,550
right you can um you know start
minimizing shrimp farm pain right which

02:30:17,230 --> 02:30:17,240
not many ways to game it right if you if
 

6597
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:19,510
not many ways to game it right if you if
you did it in terms of like GDP or a

6598
02:30:19,510 --> 02:30:19,520
you did it in terms of like GDP or a
 

6599
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:21,469
you did it in terms of like GDP or a
currency that's pinned to a certain

6601
02:30:21,479 --> 02:30:24,269
currency that's pinned to a certain

6603
02:30:24,279 --> 02:30:26,910
value that's moving right and so that's
not a good way to measure our progress

6604
02:30:26,910 --> 02:30:26,920
not a good way to measure our progress
 

6605
02:30:26,920 --> 02:30:29,910
not a good way to measure our progress
and so uh but the thing is we're both

equation a of a loss function over which

6632
02:31:04,950 --> 02:31:04,960
equation a of a loss function over which
 

6633
02:31:04,960 --> 02:31:07,190
equation a of a loss function over which
to optimize like having a kind of

6634
02:31:07,190 --> 02:31:07,200
to optimize like having a kind of
 

6635
02:31:07,200 --> 02:31:09,910
to optimize like having a kind of
intellectual humility about optimizing

6636
02:31:09,910 --> 02:31:09,920
intellectual humility about optimizing
 

6637
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:11,230
intellectual humility about optimizing
over loss

6638
02:31:11,230 --> 02:31:11,240
over loss
 

6639
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:13,990
over loss
functions yeah so so so this particular

6640
02:31:13,990 --> 02:31:14,000
functions yeah so so so this particular
 

6641
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,190
functions yeah so so so this particular
loss function it's not it's not stiff

6642
02:31:16,190 --> 02:31:16,200
loss function it's not it's not stiff
 

6643
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:18,469
loss function it's not it's not stiff
it's it's kind of an average of averages

6644
02:31:18,469 --> 02:31:18,479
it's it's kind of an average of averages
 

6645
02:31:18,479 --> 02:31:19,830
it's it's kind of an average of averages
right it's

6646
02:31:19,830 --> 02:31:19,840
right it's
 

6647
02:31:19,840 --> 02:31:22,550
right it's
like distributions of states in the

6648
02:31:22,550 --> 02:31:22,560
like distributions of states in the
 

6649
02:31:22,560 --> 02:31:24,870
like distributions of states in the
future are going to follow a certain

6650
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:24,880
future are going to follow a certain
 

6651
02:31:24,880 --> 02:31:27,870
future are going to follow a certain
distribution so it's not um

6652
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:27,880
distribution so it's not um
 

6653
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:30,349
distribution so it's not um
deterministic it's not like we're not on

6654
02:31:30,349 --> 02:31:30,359
deterministic it's not like we're not on
 

6655
02:31:30,359 --> 02:31:33,269
deterministic it's not like we're not on
like stiff rails right it's just a

6656
02:31:33,269 --> 02:31:33,279
like stiff rails right it's just a
 

6657
02:31:33,279 --> 02:31:35,870
like stiff rails right it's just a
statistical uh statement uh about the

6658
02:31:35,870 --> 02:31:35,880
statistical uh statement uh about the
 

6659
02:31:35,880 --> 02:31:37,830
statistical uh statement uh about the
future but at the end of the day you

6660
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:37,840
future but at the end of the day you
 

6661
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:40,790
future but at the end of the day you
know you can believe in gravity or not

6662
02:31:40,790 --> 02:31:40,800
know you can believe in gravity or not
 

6663
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:42,550
know you can believe in gravity or not
you know but it's not necessarily an

02:31:42,550 --> 02:31:42,560
you know but it's not necessarily an
 

6665
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:45,469
you know but it's not necessarily an
option to obey it right uh and some some

6666
02:31:45,469 --> 02:31:45,479
option to obey it right uh and some some
 

6667
02:31:45,479 --> 02:31:46,790

people try to test that that and that

02:31:46,790 --> 02:31:46,800

humans tend to fill the gap of the lack

just I guess that this is something that

02:32:53,950 --> 02:32:53,960
just I guess that this is something that
 

6721
02:32:53,960 --> 02:32:56,750
just I guess that this is something that
should be skeptical about in all

02:32:56,750 --> 02:32:56,760
should be skeptical about in all

right so we invite skepticism right do

02:33:17,640 --> 02:33:20,670

know um I think it provided initially a

6748
02:33:27,030 --> 02:33:27,040
rationalists in the early days and um
 

6749
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,309
rationalists in the early days and um
seems like the community was very

6750
02:33:28,309 --> 02:33:28,319
seems like the community was very
 

6751
02:33:28,319 --> 02:33:30,670
seems like the community was very
healthy but then you know they formed

6752
02:33:30,670 --> 02:33:30,680
healthy but then you know they formed
 

6753
02:33:30,680 --> 02:33:32,870
healthy but then you know they formed
all sorts of organizations and started

6754
02:33:32,870 --> 02:33:32,880
all sorts of organizations and started

6757
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:39,230

right they have real power they

6758
02:33:39,230 --> 02:33:39,240
right they have real power they
 

6759
02:33:39,240 --> 02:33:41,030
right they have real power they

most AI orgs now I mean they're

6762
02:33:43,469 --> 02:33:43,479
most AI orgs now I mean they're
 

6763
02:33:43,479 --> 02:33:45,670
most AI orgs now I mean they're
literally controlling the board of openi

6764
02:33:45,670 --> 02:33:45,680
literally controlling the board of openi
 

6765
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:48,950
literally controlling the board of openi
right and and look over to anthropic I

6766
02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:48,960
right and and look over to anthropic I
 

6767
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:50,269
right and and look over to anthropic I
think they all have some control over

6768
02:33:50,269 --> 02:33:50,279
think they all have some control over
 

6769
02:33:50,279 --> 02:33:54,150
think they all have some control over
that too and so I think you know the

6770
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,160
that too and so I think you know the
 

6771
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:55,830
that too and so I think you know the
Assumption of eak is more like

6772
02:33:55,830 --> 02:33:55,840
Assumption of eak is more like
 

6773
02:33:55,840 --> 02:33:58,830
Assumption of eak is more like

6777
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:02,309

Gom Verdon look like how how much
 

6803
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:37,590
Gom Verdon look like how how much
caffeine do you consume like what what's

6804
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:37,600
caffeine do you consume like what what's
 

6805
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:38,670
caffeine do you consume like what what's
the perfect

6806
02:34:38,670 --> 02:34:38,680
the perfect
 

6807
02:34:38,680 --> 02:34:41,670

regimen um I would say my my favorite
 

6811
02:34:44,840 --> 02:34:46,630

days are

6812
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:46,640
days are
 

6813
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:51,190
days are

meetings because I'm I'm CEO I have to
 

6821
02:34:58,439 --> 02:34:59,870
meetings because I'm I'm CEO I have to
interface with the outside world whether

02:34:59,870 --> 02:34:59,880
interface with the outside world whether
 

6823
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:02,349
interface with the outside world whether
it's customers or investors or we

6824
02:35:02,349 --> 02:35:02,359
it's customers or investors or we
 

6825

interviewing potential
 

6827
02:35:04,560 --> 02:35:09,550
interviewing potential
candidates um and usually I'll have uh

6828
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:09,560
candidates um and usually I'll have uh
 

6829
02:35:09,560 --> 02:35:13,110
candidates um and usually I'll have uh
ketones uh exogenous ketones um so are

6830
02:35:13,110 --> 02:35:13,120
ketones uh exogenous ketones um so are
 

6831
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:16,550
ketones uh exogenous ketones um so are
you on a keto on a keto diet is just

6832
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:16,560
you on a keto on a keto diet is just
 

6833
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:19,550
you on a keto on a keto diet is just
I've done keto before for uh football

6834
02:35:19,550 --> 02:35:19,560
I've done keto before for uh football
 

6835
02:35:19,560 --> 02:35:24,349
I've done keto before for uh football
and whatnot um but I I I like to uh have

02:35:24,349 --> 02:35:24,359
and whatnot um but I I I like to uh have
 

6837
02:35:24,359 --> 02:35:27,550
and whatnot um but I I I like to uh have
a meal after sort of part of my day is

6838
02:35:27,550 --> 02:35:27,560
a meal after sort of part of my day is
 

6839
02:35:27,560 --> 02:35:30,030
a meal after sort of part of my day is
is done and so I can just have extreme

6840
02:35:30,030 --> 02:35:30,040
is done and so I can just have extreme
 

6841
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:33,230
is done and so I can just have extreme
Focus you do the social interactions

6842
02:35:33,230 --> 02:35:33,240
Focus you do the social interactions
 

6843
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:35,590
Focus you do the social interactions
earlier in the day right without food

6844
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:35,600
earlier in the day right without food
 

6845
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:37,550
earlier in the day right without food
front load them yeah yeah like right now

6846
02:35:37,550 --> 02:35:37,560
front load them yeah yeah like right now
 

6847
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:41,349
front load them yeah yeah like right now
I'm on ketones and and Red Bull yeah uh

6848
02:35:41,349 --> 02:35:41,359
I'm on ketones and and Red Bull yeah uh
 

6849
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:43,309
I'm on ketones and and Red Bull yeah uh
and it just gives you a Clarity of

6850
02:35:43,309 --> 02:35:43,319
and it just gives you a Clarity of
 

6851
02:35:43,319 --> 02:35:45,269
and it just gives you a Clarity of
thought that is that is really Next

6852
02:35:45,269 --> 02:35:45,279
thought that is that is really Next
 

6853
02:35:45,279 --> 02:35:47,030
thought that is that is really Next
Level cuz then when you eat you're

6854
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,040
Level cuz then when you eat you're
 

6855
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:48,469
Level cuz then when you eat you're
actually allocating some of your energy

6856
02:35:48,469 --> 02:35:48,479
actually allocating some of your energy
 

6857
02:35:48,479 --> 02:35:51,190
actually allocating some of your energy
that could be going to neural energy to

6858
02:35:51,190 --> 02:35:51,200
that could be going to neural energy to
 

6859
02:35:51,200 --> 02:35:54,030
that could be going to neural energy to
to your digestion after I eat maybe I

6860
02:35:54,030 --> 02:35:54,040
to your digestion after I eat maybe I
 

6861
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:57,030
to your digestion after I eat maybe I
take a break an hour or so an hour and a

6862
02:35:57,030 --> 02:35:57,040
take a break an hour or so an hour and a
 

6863
02:35:57,040 --> 02:36:00,870
take a break an hour or so an hour and a
half and then uh usually it's like

6864
02:36:00,870 --> 02:36:00,880
half and then uh usually it's like
 

6865
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:03,070
half and then uh usually it's like
ideally one meal a day like steak and

6866
02:36:03,070 --> 02:36:03,080
ideally one meal a day like steak and
 

6867
02:36:03,080 --> 02:36:06,030
ideally one meal a day like steak and
eggs and vegetables uh animal based

6868
02:36:06,030 --> 02:36:06,040
eggs and vegetables uh animal based
 

6869
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:09,469
eggs and vegetables uh animal based
primarily so fruit and and meat and then

6870
02:36:09,469 --> 02:36:09,479
primarily so fruit and and meat and then
 

6871
02:36:09,479 --> 02:36:11,389
primarily so fruit and and meat and then
uh and then I do a second wind usually

6872
02:36:11,389 --> 02:36:11,399
uh and then I do a second wind usually
 

6873
02:36:11,399 --> 02:36:14,510
uh and then I do a second wind usually
that's deep work right uh because I'm

6874
02:36:14,510 --> 02:36:14,520
that's deep work right uh because I'm
 

6875
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:15,950
that's deep work right uh because I'm
you know I am a CEO but I'm still

6876
02:36:15,950 --> 02:36:15,960
you know I am a CEO but I'm still
 

6877
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:17,670
you know I am a CEO but I'm still
technical I'm contributing to most

6878
02:36:17,670 --> 02:36:17,680
technical I'm contributing to most
 

6879
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:21,349
technical I'm contributing to most
patents and um there I'll just stay up

6880
02:36:21,349 --> 02:36:21,359
patents and um there I'll just stay up
 

6881
02:36:21,359 --> 02:36:23,230
patents and um there I'll just stay up
late into the night and and work with

6882
02:36:23,230 --> 02:36:23,240
late into the night and and work with
 

6883
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:25,830
late into the night and and work with
Engineers on very technical problems so

6884
02:36:25,830 --> 02:36:25,840
Engineers on very technical problems so
 

6885
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:28,910
Engineers on very technical problems so
it's like the the 900 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.

6886
02:36:28,910 --> 02:36:28,920
it's like the the 900 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.
 

6887
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:31,510
it's like the the 900 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.
whatever the that range of time yeah

6888
02:36:31,510 --> 02:36:31,520
whatever the that range of time yeah
 

6889
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:33,469
whatever the that range of time yeah
yeah that's the perfect time the the

6890
02:36:33,469 --> 02:36:33,479
yeah that's the perfect time the the
 

6891
02:36:33,479 --> 02:36:35,630
yeah that's the perfect time the the
emails that the things that are on fire

6892
02:36:35,630 --> 02:36:35,640
emails that the things that are on fire
 

6893
02:36:35,640 --> 02:36:38,389
emails that the things that are on fire
stop trickling in you can you can focus

6894
02:36:38,389 --> 02:36:38,399
stop trickling in you can you can focus
 

6895
02:36:38,399 --> 02:36:41,349
stop trickling in you can you can focus
and then you have your second wind um

6896
02:36:41,349 --> 02:36:41,359
and then you have your second wind um
 

6897
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:44,710
and then you have your second wind um
and uh you know I I think Demis aabis

6898
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:44,720
and uh you know I I think Demis aabis
 

6899
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:46,830
and uh you know I I think Demis aabis
has a similar work data to some extent

6900
02:36:46,830 --> 02:36:46,840
has a similar work data to some extent
 

6901
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:48,550
has a similar work data to some extent
um so I think that that's definitely

6902
02:36:48,550 --> 02:36:48,560
um so I think that that's definitely
 

6903
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:51,750
um so I think that that's definitely
inspired my workday um but yeah that I

6904
02:36:51,750 --> 02:36:51,760
inspired my workday um but yeah that I
 

6905
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:54,070
inspired my workday um but yeah that I
started this work day when I was at at

6906
02:36:54,070 --> 02:36:54,080
started this work day when I was at at
 

6907
02:36:54,080 --> 02:36:56,389
started this work day when I was at at
Google and had to manage a bit of the

6908
02:36:56,389 --> 02:36:56,399
Google and had to manage a bit of the
 

6909
02:36:56,399 --> 02:36:58,030
Google and had to manage a bit of the
product during the day and have meetings

6910
02:36:58,030 --> 02:36:58,040
product during the day and have meetings
 

6911
02:36:58,040 --> 02:36:59,590
product during the day and have meetings
and then and then do technical work at

6912
02:36:59,590 --> 02:36:59,600
and then and then do technical work at
 

6913
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:02,830
and then and then do technical work at
night exercise sleep those kinds of

6914
02:37:02,830 --> 02:37:02,840
night exercise sleep those kinds of
 

6915
02:37:02,840 --> 02:37:05,070
night exercise sleep those kinds of
things yeah said football used to play

6916
02:37:05,070 --> 02:37:05,080
things yeah said football used to play
 

6917
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:07,469
things yeah said football used to play
football yeah I used to play American

6918
02:37:07,469 --> 02:37:07,479
football yeah I used to play American
 

6919
02:37:07,479 --> 02:37:09,510
football yeah I used to play American
football uh I've done all sorts of

6920
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:09,520
football uh I've done all sorts of
 

6921
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:11,870
football uh I've done all sorts of
sports growing up and then I was into

6922
02:37:11,870 --> 02:37:11,880
sports growing up and then I was into
 

6923
02:37:11,880 --> 02:37:14,110
sports growing up and then I was into
powerlifting for a while um so when I

6924
02:37:14,110 --> 02:37:14,120
powerlifting for a while um so when I
 

6925
02:37:14,120 --> 02:37:16,670
powerlifting for a while um so when I
was a studying U mathematics in grad

6926
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:16,680
was a studying U mathematics in grad
 

6927
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:19,670
was a studying U mathematics in grad
school I would just you know do math and

6928
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:19,680
school I would just you know do math and
 

6929
02:37:19,680 --> 02:37:22,230
school I would just you know do math and
lift take caffeine and that was my day

6930
02:37:22,230 --> 02:37:22,240
lift take caffeine and that was my day
 

6931
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:24,309
lift take caffeine and that was my day
it was very pure the the purest of Monk

6932
02:37:24,309 --> 02:37:24,319
it was very pure the the purest of Monk
 

6933
02:37:24,319 --> 02:37:27,550
it was very pure the the purest of Monk
modes um but it's really interesting how

6934
02:37:27,550 --> 02:37:27,560
modes um but it's really interesting how
 

6935
02:37:27,560 --> 02:37:29,070
modes um but it's really interesting how
in powerlifting you're trying to cause

6936
02:37:29,070 --> 02:37:29,080
in powerlifting you're trying to cause
 

6937
02:37:29,080 --> 02:37:31,349
in powerlifting you're trying to cause
neural adaptation by having certain

6938
02:37:31,349 --> 02:37:31,359
neural adaptation by having certain
 

6939
02:37:31,359 --> 02:37:33,190
neural adaptation by having certain
driving signals and you're trying to

6940
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:33,200
driving signals and you're trying to
 

6941
02:37:33,200 --> 02:37:35,190
driving signals and you're trying to
engineer neuroplasticity through all

6942
02:37:35,190 --> 02:37:35,200
engineer neuroplasticity through all
 

6943
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:36,230
engineer neuroplasticity through all
sorts of

6944
02:37:36,230 --> 02:37:36,240
sorts of
 

6945
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:38,429
sorts of
supplements um and you know you have all

6946
02:37:38,429 --> 02:37:38,439
supplements um and you know you have all
 

6947
02:37:38,439 --> 02:37:40,510
supplements um and you know you have all
sorts of you know brain derived

6948
02:37:40,510 --> 02:37:40,520
sorts of you know brain derived
 

6949
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:42,750
sorts of you know brain derived
neurotrophic factors that get secreted

6950
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:42,760
neurotrophic factors that get secreted
 

6951
02:37:42,760 --> 02:37:44,429
neurotrophic factors that get secreted
when you when you lift so it's it's

6952
02:37:44,429 --> 02:37:44,439
when you when you lift so it's it's
 

6953
02:37:44,439 --> 02:37:47,510
when you when you lift so it's it's
funny to me how I was trying to engineer

6954
02:37:47,510 --> 02:37:47,520
funny to me how I was trying to engineer
 

6955
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:51,910
funny to me how I was trying to engineer
uh um um neural adaptation in my uh

6956
02:37:51,910 --> 02:37:51,920
uh um um neural adaptation in my uh
 

6957
02:37:51,920 --> 02:37:53,830
uh um um neural adaptation in my uh
nervous system more broadly not just my

6958
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:53,840
nervous system more broadly not just my
 

6959
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:56,429
nervous system more broadly not just my
brain while learning mathematics uh I

6960
02:37:56,429 --> 02:37:56,439
brain while learning mathematics uh I
 

6961
02:37:56,439 --> 02:37:59,110
brain while learning mathematics uh I
think you can learn much

6962
02:37:59,110 --> 02:37:59,120
think you can learn much
 

6963
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:02,590
think you can learn much
faster uh if you really care if you

6964
02:38:02,590 --> 02:38:02,600
faster uh if you really care if you
 

6965
02:38:02,600 --> 02:38:04,750
faster uh if you really care if you
convince yourself to care a lot about

6966
02:38:04,750 --> 02:38:04,760
convince yourself to care a lot about
 

6967
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:07,030
convince yourself to care a lot about
what you're learning and you have some

6968
02:38:07,030 --> 02:38:07,040
what you're learning and you have some
 

6969
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:10,150
what you're learning and you have some
sort of assistance let's say uh caffeine

6970
02:38:10,150 --> 02:38:10,160
sort of assistance let's say uh caffeine
 

6971
02:38:10,160 --> 02:38:11,830
sort of assistance let's say uh caffeine
or some col energic supplement to

6972
02:38:11,830 --> 02:38:11,840
or some col energic supplement to
 

6973
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:13,030
or some col energic supplement to
increase

6974
02:38:13,030 --> 02:38:13,040
increase
 

6975
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:14,790
increase
neuroplasticity I should chat with

6976
02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:14,800
neuroplasticity I should chat with
 

6977
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:17,389
neuroplasticity I should chat with
Andrew huberman point he's the expert

6978
02:38:17,389 --> 02:38:17,399
Andrew huberman point he's the expert
 

6979
02:38:17,399 --> 02:38:21,469
Andrew huberman point he's the expert
but uh uh yeah at least to me it's like

6980
02:38:21,469 --> 02:38:21,479
but uh uh yeah at least to me it's like
 

6981
02:38:21,479 --> 02:38:23,830
but uh uh yeah at least to me it's like
you know you can try to input more

6982
02:38:23,830 --> 02:38:23,840
you know you can try to input more
 

6983
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:25,870
you know you can try to input more
tokens into your brain if you will and

6984
02:38:25,870 --> 02:38:25,880
tokens into your brain if you will and
 

6985
02:38:25,880 --> 02:38:27,190
tokens into your brain if you will and
you can try to increase the learning

6986
02:38:27,190 --> 02:38:27,200
you can try to increase the learning
 

6987
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:29,590
you can try to increase the learning
rate so that you can learn much faster

6988
02:38:29,590 --> 02:38:29,600
rate so that you can learn much faster
 

6989
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:32,710
rate so that you can learn much faster
on a shorter time scale so I've learned

6990
02:38:32,710 --> 02:38:32,720
on a shorter time scale so I've learned
 

6991
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:34,750
on a shorter time scale so I've learned
a lot of things I followed my curiosity

6992
02:38:34,750 --> 02:38:34,760
a lot of things I followed my curiosity
 

6993
02:38:34,760 --> 02:38:36,710
a lot of things I followed my curiosity
you're naturally if you're passionate

6994
02:38:36,710 --> 02:38:36,720
you're naturally if you're passionate
 

6995
02:38:36,720 --> 02:38:37,710
you're naturally if you're passionate
about what you're doing you're going to

6996
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:37,720
about what you're doing you're going to
 

6997
02:38:37,720 --> 02:38:38,910
about what you're doing you're going to
learn faster you're going to become

6998
02:38:38,910 --> 02:38:38,920
learn faster you're going to become
 

6999
02:38:38,920 --> 02:38:39,870
learn faster you're going to become
smarter

7000
02:38:39,870 --> 02:38:39,880
smarter
 

7001
02:38:39,880 --> 02:38:41,990
smarter
faster um and if you follow your

7002
02:38:41,990 --> 02:38:42,000
faster um and if you follow your
 

7003
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:43,429
faster um and if you follow your
curiosity you're always going to be

7004
02:38:43,429 --> 02:38:43,439
curiosity you're always going to be
 

7005
02:38:43,439 --> 02:38:45,950
curiosity you're always going to be
interested and so I advise people to

7006
02:38:45,950 --> 02:38:45,960
interested and so I advise people to
 

7007
02:38:45,960 --> 02:38:47,910
interested and so I advise people to
follow their curiosity and don't respect

7008
02:38:47,910 --> 02:38:47,920
follow their curiosity and don't respect
 

7009
02:38:47,920 --> 02:38:50,910
follow their curiosity and don't respect
the boundaries of certain fields or what

7010
02:38:50,910 --> 02:38:50,920
the boundaries of certain fields or what
 

7011
02:38:50,920 --> 02:38:52,510
the boundaries of certain fields or what
you've been allocated in terms of Lane

7012
02:38:52,510 --> 02:38:52,520
you've been allocated in terms of Lane
 

7013
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:54,550
you've been allocated in terms of Lane
of what you're working on uh just go out

7014
02:38:54,550 --> 02:38:54,560
of what you're working on uh just go out
 

7015
02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:57,950
of what you're working on uh just go out
and explore and follow your nose and try

7016
02:38:57,950 --> 02:38:57,960
and explore and follow your nose and try
 

7017
02:38:57,960 --> 02:39:00,790
and explore and follow your nose and try
to uh acquire and compress as much

7018
02:39:00,790 --> 02:39:00,800
to uh acquire and compress as much
 

7019
02:39:00,800 --> 02:39:02,910
to uh acquire and compress as much
information as you can into your brain

7020
02:39:02,910 --> 02:39:02,920
information as you can into your brain
 

7021
02:39:02,920 --> 02:39:05,110
information as you can into your brain
anything that you find interesting and

7022
02:39:05,110 --> 02:39:05,120
anything that you find interesting and
 

7023
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:07,030
anything that you find interesting and
caring about a thing and like you said

7024
02:39:07,030 --> 02:39:07,040
caring about a thing and like you said
 

7025
02:39:07,040 --> 02:39:08,510
caring about a thing and like you said
which is interesting it does it works

7026
02:39:08,510 --> 02:39:08,520
which is interesting it does it works
 

7027
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:10,630
which is interesting it does it works
for me really well it's like tricking

7028
02:39:10,630 --> 02:39:10,640
for me really well it's like tricking
 

7029
02:39:10,640 --> 02:39:13,269
for me really well it's like tricking
yourself that you care about a thing yes

7030
02:39:13,269 --> 02:39:13,279
yourself that you care about a thing yes
 

7031
02:39:13,279 --> 02:39:14,830
yourself that you care about a thing yes
and then you start to really care about

7032
02:39:14,830 --> 02:39:14,840
and then you start to really care about
 

7033
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:18,309
and then you start to really care about
it yep so it's funny the

7034
02:39:18,309 --> 02:39:18,319
it yep so it's funny the
 

7035
02:39:18,319 --> 02:39:21,230
it yep so it's funny the
motivation is a really good Catalyst for

7036
02:39:21,230 --> 02:39:21,240
motivation is a really good Catalyst for
 

7037
02:39:21,240 --> 02:39:24,950
motivation is a really good Catalyst for
learning right and so at least part part

7038
02:39:24,950 --> 02:39:24,960
learning right and so at least part part
 

7039
02:39:24,960 --> 02:39:28,070
learning right and so at least part part
part of my character uh as bef Jos is

7040
02:39:28,070 --> 02:39:28,080
part of my character uh as bef Jos is
 

7041
02:39:28,080 --> 02:39:30,750
part of my character uh as bef Jos is
kind of like yeah yeah the hype man yeah

7042
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:30,760
kind of like yeah yeah the hype man yeah
 

7043
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:32,670
kind of like yeah yeah the hype man yeah
just hype but I'm like hyping myself up

7044
02:39:32,670 --> 02:39:32,680
just hype but I'm like hyping myself up
 

7045
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:34,429
just hype but I'm like hyping myself up
but then I just tweet about it yeah and

7046
02:39:34,429 --> 02:39:34,439
but then I just tweet about it yeah and
 

7047
02:39:34,439 --> 02:39:35,910
but then I just tweet about it yeah and
it's just when I'm trying to get really

7048
02:39:35,910 --> 02:39:35,920
it's just when I'm trying to get really
 

7049
02:39:35,920 --> 02:39:38,030
it's just when I'm trying to get really
hyped up and in like an altered state of

7050
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:38,040
hyped up and in like an altered state of
 

7051
02:39:38,040 --> 02:39:40,150
hyped up and in like an altered state of
consciousness where I'm like Ultra

7052
02:39:40,150 --> 02:39:40,160
consciousness where I'm like Ultra
 

7053
02:39:40,160 --> 02:39:42,349
consciousness where I'm like Ultra
focused in the flow wired trying to

7054
02:39:42,349 --> 02:39:42,359
focused in the flow wired trying to
 

7055
02:39:42,359 --> 02:39:44,070
focused in the flow wired trying to
invent something that's never existed I

7056
02:39:44,070 --> 02:39:44,080
invent something that's never existed I
 

7057
02:39:44,080 --> 02:39:46,630
invent something that's never existed I
need to get to like un real levels of

7058
02:39:46,630 --> 02:39:46,640
need to get to like un real levels of
 

7059
02:39:46,640 --> 02:39:49,750
need to get to like un real levels of
like excitement but your brain has these

7060
02:39:49,750 --> 02:39:49,760
like excitement but your brain has these
 

7061
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:52,590
like excitement but your brain has these
levels of of cognition that you can

7062
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:52,600
levels of of cognition that you can
 

7063
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:54,630
levels of of cognition that you can
unlock with like higher levels of

7064
02:39:54,630 --> 02:39:54,640
unlock with like higher levels of
 

7065
02:39:54,640 --> 02:39:57,910
unlock with like higher levels of
adrenaline and and whatnot and I mean

7066
02:39:57,910 --> 02:39:57,920
adrenaline and and whatnot and I mean
 

7067
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:00,230
adrenaline and and whatnot and I mean
I've learned that in powerlifting that

7068
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:00,240
I've learned that in powerlifting that
 

7069
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:02,510
I've learned that in powerlifting that
actually you can engineer a mental

7070
02:40:02,510 --> 02:40:02,520
actually you can engineer a mental
 

7071
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:05,550
actually you can engineer a mental
switch to like increase your strength

7072
02:40:05,550 --> 02:40:05,560
switch to like increase your strength
 

7073
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:07,870
switch to like increase your strength
right like if you can engineer a switch

7074
02:40:07,870 --> 02:40:07,880
right like if you can engineer a switch
 

7075
02:40:07,880 --> 02:40:09,590
right like if you can engineer a switch
maybe you have a prompt like a certain

7076
02:40:09,590 --> 02:40:09,600
maybe you have a prompt like a certain
 

7077
02:40:09,600 --> 02:40:12,309
maybe you have a prompt like a certain
song or some music where suddenly you're

7078
02:40:12,309 --> 02:40:12,319
song or some music where suddenly you're
 

7079
02:40:12,319 --> 02:40:15,150
song or some music where suddenly you're
like fully primed then you're at Max

7080
02:40:15,150 --> 02:40:15,160
like fully primed then you're at Max
 

7081
02:40:15,160 --> 02:40:17,030
like fully primed then you're at Max
maximum strength right and I've

7082
02:40:17,030 --> 02:40:17,040
maximum strength right and I've
 

7083
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:19,190
maximum strength right and I've
engineered that that switch through

7084
02:40:19,190 --> 02:40:19,200
engineered that that switch through
 

7085
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:21,030
engineered that that switch through
years of lifting if you're going to get

7086
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:21,040
years of lifting if you're going to get
 

7087
02:40:21,040 --> 02:40:24,030
years of lifting if you're going to get
under 500 lb and it could crush you if

7088
02:40:24,030 --> 02:40:24,040
under 500 lb and it could crush you if
 

7089
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:27,230
under 500 lb and it could crush you if
you don't have that switch to be wired

7090
02:40:27,230 --> 02:40:27,240
you don't have that switch to be wired
 

7091
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:29,389
you don't have that switch to be wired
in you might die so that that'll wake

7092
02:40:29,389 --> 02:40:29,399
in you might die so that that'll wake
 

7093
02:40:29,399 --> 02:40:31,950
in you might die so that that'll wake
you right up and and that sort of skill

7094
02:40:31,950 --> 02:40:31,960
you right up and and that sort of skill
 

7095
02:40:31,960 --> 02:40:34,550
you right up and and that sort of skill
I've carried over to like research when

7096
02:40:34,550 --> 02:40:34,560
I've carried over to like research when
 

7097
02:40:34,560 --> 02:40:36,150
I've carried over to like research when
it's when it's go time when the stakes

7098
02:40:36,150 --> 02:40:36,160
it's when it's go time when the stakes
 

7099
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:38,830
it's when it's go time when the stakes
are high somehow I just reach another

7100
02:40:38,830 --> 02:40:38,840
are high somehow I just reach another
 

7101
02:40:38,840 --> 02:40:41,469
are high somehow I just reach another
level of neural performance so be Jos is

7102
02:40:41,469 --> 02:40:41,479
level of neural performance so be Jos is
 

7103
02:40:41,479 --> 02:40:44,510
level of neural performance so be Jos is
your sort of embodiment representation

7104
02:40:44,510 --> 02:40:44,520
your sort of embodiment representation
 

7105
02:40:44,520 --> 02:40:46,910
your sort of embodiment representation
of your intellect ual

7106
02:40:46,910 --> 02:40:46,920
of your intellect ual
 

7107
02:40:46,920 --> 02:40:50,990
of your intellect ual
Hulk productivity Hulk they just turn on

7108
02:40:50,990 --> 02:40:51,000
Hulk productivity Hulk they just turn on
 

7109
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,950
Hulk productivity Hulk they just turn on
what have you learned about the the

7110
02:40:52,950 --> 02:40:52,960
what have you learned about the the
 

7111
02:40:52,960 --> 02:40:55,870
what have you learned about the the
nature of identity from having these two

7112
02:40:55,870 --> 02:40:55,880
nature of identity from having these two
 

7113
02:40:55,880 --> 02:40:57,469
nature of identity from having these two
identities I think it's interesting for

7114
02:40:57,469 --> 02:40:57,479
identities I think it's interesting for
 

7115
02:40:57,479 --> 02:40:59,230
identities I think it's interesting for
people to be able to put on those two

7116
02:40:59,230 --> 02:40:59,240
people to be able to put on those two
 

7117
02:40:59,240 --> 02:41:01,750
people to be able to put on those two
hats so explicitly I think it was

7118
02:41:01,750 --> 02:41:01,760
hats so explicitly I think it was
 

7119
02:41:01,760 --> 02:41:03,510
hats so explicitly I think it was
interesting in the early days I think in

7120
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:03,520
interesting in the early days I think in
 

7121
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:05,469
interesting in the early days I think in
the early days I thought it was truly

7122
02:41:05,469 --> 02:41:05,479
the early days I thought it was truly
 

7123
02:41:05,479 --> 02:41:07,630
the early days I thought it was truly
compartmentalized like oh yeah this is a

7124
02:41:07,630 --> 02:41:07,640
compartmentalized like oh yeah this is a
 

7125
02:41:07,640 --> 02:41:10,269
compartmentalized like oh yeah this is a
character you know I'm Gom Beth is just

7126
02:41:10,269 --> 02:41:10,279
character you know I'm Gom Beth is just
 

7127
02:41:10,279 --> 02:41:12,750
character you know I'm Gom Beth is just
the the character I like I like take my

7128
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:12,760
the the character I like I like take my
 

7129
02:41:12,760 --> 02:41:14,510
the the character I like I like take my
thoughts and then I extrapolate them to

7130
02:41:14,510 --> 02:41:14,520
thoughts and then I extrapolate them to
 

7131
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:16,230
thoughts and then I extrapolate them to
a bit more extreme

7132
02:41:16,230 --> 02:41:16,240
a bit more extreme
 

7133
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:19,670
a bit more extreme
but you know over time it's kind of like

7134
02:41:19,670 --> 02:41:19,680
but you know over time it's kind of like
 

7135
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:21,550
but you know over time it's kind of like
both identities were starting to merge

7136
02:41:21,550 --> 02:41:21,560
both identities were starting to merge
 

7137
02:41:21,560 --> 02:41:23,550
both identities were starting to merge
mentally and people are like no you are

7138
02:41:23,550 --> 02:41:23,560
mentally and people are like no you are
 

7139
02:41:23,560 --> 02:41:25,670
mentally and people are like no you are
I met you you are Beth you are not just

7140
02:41:25,670 --> 02:41:25,680
I met you you are Beth you are not just
 

7141
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:29,710
I met you you are Beth you are not just
Gom MH and I was like wait am I and now

7142
02:41:29,710 --> 02:41:29,720
Gom MH and I was like wait am I and now
 

7143
02:41:29,720 --> 02:41:31,870
Gom MH and I was like wait am I and now
it's like fully merged but it was

7144
02:41:31,870 --> 02:41:31,880
it's like fully merged but it was
 

7145
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:33,429
it's like fully merged but it was
already before the docs it was already

7146
02:41:33,429 --> 02:41:33,439
already before the docs it was already
 

7147
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:36,990
already before the docs it was already
starting mentally that you know I'm I am

7148
02:41:36,990 --> 02:41:37,000
starting mentally that you know I'm I am
 

7149
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,510
starting mentally that you know I'm I am
this character um it's part of me would

7150
02:41:39,510 --> 02:41:39,520
this character um it's part of me would
 

7151

you recommend people sort of have an Al

7152
02:41:42,710 --> 02:41:42,720
you recommend people sort of have an Al
 

7153
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:44,750
you recommend people sort of have an Al
absolutely like young people would you

7154
02:41:44,750 --> 02:41:44,760
absolutely like young people would you
 

7155
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:46,510
absolutely like young people would you
recommend them to explore different

7156
02:41:46,510 --> 02:41:46,520
recommend them to explore different
 

7157
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:49,429
recommend them to explore different
identities by having alts alt accounts

7158
02:41:49,429 --> 02:41:49,439
identities by having alts alt accounts
 

7159
02:41:49,439 --> 02:41:50,990
identities by having alts alt accounts
it's it's fun it's like it's like

7160
02:41:50,990 --> 02:41:51,000
it's it's fun it's like it's like
 

7161
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,830
it's it's fun it's like it's like
writing an essay and taking a position

7162
02:41:52,830 --> 02:41:52,840
writing an essay and taking a position
 

7163
02:41:52,840 --> 02:41:54,349
writing an essay and taking a position
right it's like you do this in debate

7164
02:41:54,349 --> 02:41:54,359
right it's like you do this in debate
 

7165
02:41:54,359 --> 02:41:56,550
right it's like you do this in debate
it's it's like you can have experimental

7166
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:56,560
it's it's like you can have experimental
 

7167
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:59,510
it's it's like you can have experimental
thoughts and and by having by the stakes

7168
02:41:59,510 --> 02:41:59,520
thoughts and and by having by the stakes
 

7169
02:41:59,520 --> 02:42:01,309
thoughts and and by having by the stakes
being so low because you're an Anon

stakes environment I feel like we've

7178
02:42:08,150 --> 02:42:08,160
stakes environment I feel like we've
 

7179
02:42:08,160 --> 02:42:11,550
stakes environment I feel like we've
lost that in the era of everything being

7180
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:11,560
lost that in the era of everything being
 

7181
02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:12,990
lost that in the era of everything being
under your main name everything being

attributable to you people just are
 

7185
02:42:14,760 --> 02:42:17,269
attributable to you people just are
afraid to speak explore ideas that

7186
02:42:17,269 --> 02:42:17,279
afraid to speak explore ideas that
 

7187
02:42:17,279 --> 02:42:20,389
afraid to speak explore ideas that
aren't fully formed right and and I feel

7188
02:42:20,389 --> 02:42:20,399
aren't fully formed right and and I feel
 

7189
02:42:20,399 --> 02:42:22,269
aren't fully formed right and and I feel
like we've lost something there so I I I

trying to stay snonymous or Anonymous um

7196
02:42:30,030 --> 02:42:30,040
trying to stay snonymous or Anonymous um
 

7197
02:42:30,040 --> 02:42:32,429
trying to stay snonymous or Anonymous um
because it's really important for for

7198
02:42:32,429 --> 02:42:32,439
because it's really important for for
 

7199
02:42:32,439 --> 02:42:35,269
because it's really important for for
people to share thoughts that aren't

7200

people to share thoughts that aren't
 

7201
02:42:35,279 --> 02:42:37,590
people to share thoughts that aren't
fully formed and converge onto maybe

Hidden Truths that were hard to converge

7204
02:42:40,349 --> 02:42:40,359
Hidden Truths that were hard to converge
 

7205
02:42:40,359 --> 02:42:44,710
Hidden Truths that were hard to converge
upon if it was just through open um

7206
02:42:44,710 --> 02:42:44,720
upon if it was just through open um
 

7207
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:46,910
upon if it was just through open um
conversation with real names yeah I

7208
02:42:46,910 --> 02:42:46,920
conversation with real names yeah I
 

7209
02:42:46,920 --> 02:42:50,630
conversation with real names yeah I
really believe in like not radical but

7210
02:42:50,630 --> 02:42:50,640
really believe in like not radical but
 

7211
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:53,150
really believe in like not radical but
rigorous empathy it's like really

7212
02:42:53,150 --> 02:42:53,160
rigorous empathy it's like really
 

7213
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:55,510
rigorous empathy it's like really
considering what it's like to be a

7214
02:42:55,510 --> 02:42:55,520
considering what it's like to be a
 

7215
02:42:55,520 --> 02:42:57,950
considering what it's like to be a
person of a certain Viewpoint and like

7216
02:42:57,950 --> 02:42:57,960
person of a certain Viewpoint and like
 

7217
02:42:57,960 --> 02:43:00,030
person of a certain Viewpoint and like
taking that as a thought experiment

7218
02:43:00,030 --> 02:43:00,040
taking that as a thought experiment
 

7219
02:43:00,040 --> 02:43:02,110
taking that as a thought experiment
farther and farther and farther and one

7220
02:43:02,110 --> 02:43:02,120
farther and farther and farther and one
 

7221
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:04,429
farther and farther and farther and one
way of doing that is an Al to

7222
02:43:04,429 --> 02:43:04,439
way of doing that is an Al to
 

7223
02:43:04,439 --> 02:43:07,389
way of doing that is an Al to
account uh that's a that's a that's a

7224
02:43:07,389 --> 02:43:07,399
account uh that's a that's a that's a
 

7225
02:43:07,399 --> 02:43:10,110
account uh that's a that's a that's a
fun interesting way to really explore

7226
02:43:10,110 --> 02:43:10,120
fun interesting way to really explore
 

7227
02:43:10,120 --> 02:43:11,429
fun interesting way to really explore
what it's like to be a person that

weeks
 

7235
02:43:18,680 --> 02:43:20,630
weeks
months of course there's always the

7236
02:43:20,630 --> 02:43:20,640
months of course there's always the
 

7237
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:24,150
months of course there's always the
danger of becoming that that's uh that's

02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:24,160
danger of becoming that that's uh that's
 

7239

abyss the abyss gazes into you you have
to be careful breaking bef yeah right

7244
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:33,680
to be careful breaking bef yeah right
 

7245
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:35,830
to be careful breaking bef yeah right
breaking bef yeah you wake up with a

7246

02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:44,510
I what have I become uh so you've
mentioned quite a bit of advice already

7252
02:43:44,510 --> 02:43:44,520
mentioned quite a bit of advice already
 

7253
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:45,830
mentioned quite a bit of advice already
but what advice would did you give to

7254
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:45,840
but what advice would did you give to
 

7255
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:47,590
but what advice would did you give to
young

7256
02:43:47,590 --> 02:43:47,600
young
 

7257
02:43:47,600 --> 02:43:51,230
young
people of how to in this interesting

7258
02:43:51,230 --> 02:43:51,240
people of how to in this interesting
 

7259
02:43:51,240 --> 02:43:54,230
people of how to in this interesting
World we're in how to have a career and

7260
02:43:54,230 --> 02:43:54,240
World we're in how to have a career and
 

7261
02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:57,630
World we're in how to have a career and
how to have a life they can be proud

7262
02:43:57,630 --> 02:43:57,640
how to have a life they can be proud
 

7263
02:43:57,640 --> 02:44:00,790
how to have a life they can be proud
of I think to me the reason I went to

7264
02:44:00,790 --> 02:44:00,800
of I think to me the reason I went to
 

7265
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:03,269
of I think to me the reason I went to
theoretical physics was that I had to

7266
02:44:03,269 --> 02:44:03,279
theoretical physics was that I had to
 

7267
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:05,710
theoretical physics was that I had to
learn the base of the stack that was

7268
02:44:05,710 --> 02:44:05,720
learn the base of the stack that was
 

7269
02:44:05,720 --> 02:44:08,469
learn the base of the stack that was
going to stick around no matter yeah how

7270
02:44:08,469 --> 02:44:08,479
going to stick around no matter yeah how
 

7271
02:44:08,479 --> 02:44:11,790
going to stick around no matter yeah how
the technology changes right um and to

7272
02:44:11,790 --> 02:44:11,800
the technology changes right um and to
 

7273
02:44:11,800 --> 02:44:13,990
the technology changes right um and to
me that was the foundation upon which

7274
02:44:13,990 --> 02:44:14,000
me that was the foundation upon which
 

7275
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,830
me that was the foundation upon which
then I later built engineering uh skills

7276
02:44:16,830 --> 02:44:16,840
then I later built engineering uh skills
 

7277
02:44:16,840 --> 02:44:19,309
then I later built engineering uh skills
and other skills and to me the laws of

7278
02:44:19,309 --> 02:44:19,319
and other skills and to me the laws of
 

7279
02:44:19,319 --> 02:44:20,990
and other skills and to me the laws of
physics you know it may seem like the

7280
02:44:20,990 --> 02:44:21,000
physics you know it may seem like the
 

7281
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:22,910
physics you know it may seem like the
landscape right now is changing so fast

7282
02:44:22,910 --> 02:44:22,920
landscape right now is changing so fast
 

7283
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:25,269
landscape right now is changing so fast
it's disorienting but certain things

7284
02:44:25,269 --> 02:44:25,279
it's disorienting but certain things
 

7285
02:44:25,279 --> 02:44:27,070
it's disorienting but certain things
like fundamental mathematics and physics

7286
02:44:27,070 --> 02:44:27,080
like fundamental mathematics and physics
 

7287
02:44:27,080 --> 02:44:29,630
like fundamental mathematics and physics
aren't going to change and if you have

7288
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:29,640
aren't going to change and if you have
 

7289
02:44:29,640 --> 02:44:32,269
aren't going to change and if you have
that knowledge uh and and knowledge

7290
02:44:32,269 --> 02:44:32,279
that knowledge uh and and knowledge
 

7291
02:44:32,279 --> 02:44:34,510
that knowledge uh and and knowledge
about complex systems and adaptive

7292
02:44:34,510 --> 02:44:34,520
about complex systems and adaptive
 

7293
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:36,269
about complex systems and adaptive
systems I think that's going to carry

7294
02:44:36,269 --> 02:44:36,279
systems I think that's going to carry
 

7295
02:44:36,279 --> 02:44:39,429
systems I think that's going to carry
you very far and so uh not everybody has

7296
02:44:39,429 --> 02:44:39,439
you very far and so uh not everybody has
 

7297
02:44:39,439 --> 02:44:42,269
you very far and so uh not everybody has
to study mathematics but I think it's

7298
02:44:42,269 --> 02:44:42,279
to study mathematics but I think it's
 

7299
02:44:42,279 --> 02:44:45,469
to study mathematics but I think it's
really a huge cognitive unlock to to

7300
02:44:45,469 --> 02:44:45,479
really a huge cognitive unlock to to
 

7301
02:44:45,479 --> 02:44:47,469
really a huge cognitive unlock to to
learn math and and some physics and

7302
02:44:47,469 --> 02:44:47,479
learn math and and some physics and
 

7303
02:44:47,479 --> 02:44:49,590
learn math and and some physics and
Engineering get as close to the base of

7304
02:44:49,590 --> 02:44:49,600
Engineering get as close to the base of
 

7305
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,070
Engineering get as close to the base of
the stack as possible yeah that's right

7306
02:44:52,070 --> 02:44:52,080
the stack as possible yeah that's right
 

7307
02:44:52,080 --> 02:44:53,550
the stack as possible yeah that's right
because because the base of the stack

7308
02:44:53,550 --> 02:44:53,560
because because the base of the stack
 

7309
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:55,429
because because the base of the stack
doesn't change everything else you know

7310
02:44:55,429 --> 02:44:55,439
doesn't change everything else you know
 

7311
02:44:55,439 --> 02:44:57,030
doesn't change everything else you know
your knowledge might become not as

7312
02:44:57,030 --> 02:44:57,040
your knowledge might become not as
 

7313
02:44:57,040 --> 02:44:58,429
your knowledge might become not as
relevant in a few years of course

7314
02:44:58,429 --> 02:44:58,439
relevant in a few years of course
 

7315
02:44:58,439 --> 02:44:59,950
relevant in a few years of course
there's a sort of transfer learning you

7316
02:44:59,950 --> 02:44:59,960
there's a sort of transfer learning you
 

7317
02:44:59,960 --> 02:45:01,990
there's a sort of transfer learning you
can do but then you have to always

7318
02:45:01,990 --> 02:45:02,000
can do but then you have to always
 

7319
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,750
can do but then you have to always
transfer learn constantly I guess the

7320
02:45:04,750 --> 02:45:04,760
transfer learn constantly I guess the
 

7321
02:45:04,760 --> 02:45:06,269
transfer learn constantly I guess the
closer you are to the base of the stack

7322
02:45:06,269 --> 02:45:06,279
closer you are to the base of the stack
 

7323
02:45:06,279 --> 02:45:08,469
closer you are to the base of the stack
the easier the the the the easier the

7324
02:45:08,469 --> 02:45:08,479
the easier the the the the easier the
 

7325
02:45:08,479 --> 02:45:10,510
the easier the the the the easier the
transfer learning the shorter the jump

7326
02:45:10,510 --> 02:45:10,520
transfer learning the shorter the jump
 

7327
02:45:10,520 --> 02:45:13,190
transfer learning the shorter the jump
right right and you'd be surprised like

7328
02:45:13,190 --> 02:45:13,200
right right and you'd be surprised like
 

7329
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:17,389
right right and you'd be surprised like
once you've learned Concepts and many

7330
02:45:17,389 --> 02:45:17,399
once you've learned Concepts and many
 

7331
02:45:17,399 --> 02:45:19,790
once you've learned Concepts and many
physical scenarios how they can carry

7332
02:45:19,790 --> 02:45:19,800
physical scenarios how they can carry
 

7333
02:45:19,800 --> 02:45:21,910
physical scenarios how they can carry
over to understanding other systems that

7334
02:45:21,910 --> 02:45:21,920
over to understanding other systems that
 

7335
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:24,670
over to understanding other systems that
are necessarily physics and I guess like

7336
02:45:24,670 --> 02:45:24,680
are necessarily physics and I guess like
 

7337
02:45:24,680 --> 02:45:26,950
are necessarily physics and I guess like
the eak writings you know the the

7338
02:45:26,950 --> 02:45:26,960
the eak writings you know the the
 

7339
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:29,190
the eak writings you know the the

principles and tenet post uh that was
 

7341
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:30,870

based on physics that was kind of my

7342
02:45:30,870 --> 02:45:30,880
based on physics that was kind of my

think the same is true for capitalism

7376
02:46:19,790 --> 02:46:19,800

everything everything must die at some

7380
02:46:25,469 --> 02:46:25,479
everything everything must die at some
 

7381
02:46:25,479 --> 02:46:28,190
everything everything must die at some
point I think that we should probably

7382
02:46:28,190 --> 02:46:28,200
point I think that we should probably
 

7383
02:46:28,200 --> 02:46:31,590
point I think that we should probably
extend our lifespan because uh we need a

7384
02:46:31,590 --> 02:46:31,600
extend our lifespan because uh we need a
 

7385
02:46:31,600 --> 02:46:34,429
extend our lifespan because uh we need a
longer period of of training because the

7386
02:46:34,429 --> 02:46:34,439
longer period of of training because the
 

7387
02:46:34,439 --> 02:46:36,070
longer period of of training because the
world is more and more complex right we

7388
02:46:36,070 --> 02:46:36,080
world is more and more complex right we
 

7389
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:39,150
world is more and more complex right we
have more and more data to really be

7390
02:46:39,150 --> 02:46:39,160
have more and more data to really be
 

7391
02:46:39,160 --> 02:46:41,269
have more and more data to really be
able to predict and understand the world

7392
02:46:41,269 --> 02:46:41,279
able to predict and understand the world
 

7393
02:46:41,279 --> 02:46:43,990
able to predict and understand the world
and if we have a finite window of higher

7394
02:46:43,990 --> 02:46:44,000
and if we have a finite window of higher
 

7395
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,870
and if we have a finite window of higher
neuroplasticity

7396
02:46:45,870 --> 02:46:45,880
neuroplasticity
 

7397
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:47,990
neuroplasticity
then then we have sort of a hard cap in

7398
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:48,000
then then we have sort of a hard cap in
 

7399
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,950
then then we have sort of a hard cap in
how much we can understand about our

7400
02:46:49,950 --> 02:46:49,960
how much we can understand about our
 

7401
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:53,550
how much we can understand about our
world so you know I think I am for death

7402
02:46:53,550 --> 02:46:53,560
world so you know I think I am for death
 

7403
02:46:53,560 --> 02:46:55,750
world so you know I think I am for death
because again I think it's important you

7404
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:55,760
because again I think it's important you
 

7405
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:57,670
because again I think it's important you
know if if you had like a king that

7406
02:46:57,670 --> 02:46:57,680
know if if you had like a king that
 

7407
02:46:57,680 --> 02:47:00,030
know if if you had like a king that
would never die that would be a problem

and so uh death gives space for uh Youth

7434
02:47:33,269 --> 02:47:33,279
and so uh death gives space for uh Youth
 

7435
02:47:33,279 --> 02:47:36,510
and so uh death gives space for uh Youth
and Novelty to to take its place and I

7436
02:47:36,510 --> 02:47:36,520
and Novelty to to take its place and I
 

7437
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:38,790
and Novelty to to take its place and I
think it's an important part of every

system and nature so yeah I am for I am
for death but I do think that longer

7442
02:47:46,190 --> 02:47:46,200
for death but I do think that longer
 

7443
02:47:46,200 --> 02:47:48,469
for death but I do think that longer
lifespan and longer time for

7444
02:47:48,469 --> 02:47:48,479
lifespan and longer time for
 

7445
02:47:48,479 --> 02:47:50,510
lifespan and longer time for

neuroplasticity bigger brains which
 

7447
02:47:50,520 --> 02:47:52,870
neuroplasticity bigger brains which
should be something we should strive for

02:49:10,880 --> 02:49:12,590
that we describe in in eak and and uh I
think maintaining this adaptation

7500

think maintaining this adaptation
 

7501
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:15,150
think maintaining this adaptation

02:49:57,590 --> 02:49:57,600
nature well then you get into the
 

7539
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:59,590
nature well then you get into the
anthropic principle right in the

7540
02:49:59,590 --> 02:49:59,600
anthropic principle right in the
 

7541
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:02,150
anthropic principle right in the
landscape of potential universes right

7542
02:50:02,150 --> 02:50:02,160

7543
02:50:02,160 --> 02:50:03,910

we're in the universe that allows for

02:50:03,910 --> 02:50:03,920
we're in the universe that allows for
 

7545
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:08,309
we're in the universe that allows for
Life uh and then why is there

7546
02:50:08,309 --> 02:50:08,319
Life uh and then why is there
 

7547
02:50:08,319 --> 02:50:09,790
Life uh and then why is there
potentially many

7548
02:50:09,790 --> 02:50:09,800
potentially many
 

7549
02:50:09,800 --> 02:50:11,950
potentially many
universes I don't know I don't know that

7550
02:50:11,950 --> 02:50:11,960
universes I don't know I don't know that
 

7551
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:14,710
universes I don't know I don't know that
part but could we potentially and

7552
02:50:14,710 --> 02:50:14,720
part but could we potentially and
 

7553
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:18,190
part but could we potentially and
engineer new universes or create pocket

7554
02:50:18,190 --> 02:50:18,200
engineer new universes or create pocket
 

7555
02:50:18,200 --> 02:50:20,950
engineer new universes or create pocket
universes uh and set the hyperparameters

7556
02:50:20,950 --> 02:50:20,960
universes uh and set the hyperparameters
 

7557
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:22,429
universes uh and set the hyperparameters
so there is some mutual information

7558
02:50:22,429 --> 02:50:22,439
so there is some mutual information
 

7559
02:50:22,439 --> 02:50:25,190
so there is some mutual information
between our existence and that universe

7560
02:50:25,190 --> 02:50:25,200
between our existence and that universe
 

7561
02:50:25,200 --> 02:50:27,710
between our existence and that universe
and we'd be somewhat its parents I think

7562
02:50:27,710 --> 02:50:27,720
and we'd be somewhat its parents I think
 

7563
02:50:27,720 --> 02:50:29,990
and we'd be somewhat its parents I think
that's really I don't know that'd be

7564
02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:30,000
that's really I don't know that'd be
 

7565
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,590
that's really I don't know that'd be
very poetic it's purely conjecture but

7566
02:50:33,590 --> 02:50:33,600
very poetic it's purely conjecture but
 

7567
02:50:33,600 --> 02:50:35,910
very poetic it's purely conjecture but
um again this is why figuring out

7568
02:50:35,910 --> 02:50:35,920
um again this is why figuring out
 

7569
02:50:35,920 --> 02:50:38,469
um again this is why figuring out
quantum gravity would allow us to

7570
02:50:38,469 --> 02:50:38,479
quantum gravity would allow us to
 

7571
02:50:38,479 --> 02:50:40,670
quantum gravity would allow us to
understand if we can do that and above

7572
02:50:40,670 --> 02:50:40,680
understand if we can do that and above
 

7573
02:50:40,680 --> 02:50:43,750
understand if we can do that and above
that why do it all seem so beautiful and

7574
02:50:43,750 --> 02:50:43,760
that why do it all seem so beautiful and
 

7575
02:50:43,760 --> 02:50:47,269
that why do it all seem so beautiful and
exciting the the quest of freaking

7576
02:50:47,269 --> 02:50:47,279
exciting the the quest of freaking

02:50:47,279 --> 02:50:48,309
exciting the the quest of freaking

gravity seems so exciting why why is

7580
02:50:51,910 --> 02:50:51,920
gravity seems so exciting why why is
 

7581
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:53,710
gravity seems so exciting why why is
that why are we drawn to that why are we

7582
02:50:53,710 --> 02:50:53,720
that why are we drawn to that why are we
 

7583
02:50:53,720 --> 02:50:56,630
that why are we drawn to that why are we
pulled towards that just just that

7584
02:50:56,630 --> 02:50:56,640
pulled towards that just just that
 

7585
02:50:56,640 --> 02:50:59,510

puzzle solving creative force that

7586
02:50:59,510 --> 02:50:59,520
puzzle solving creative force that
 

7587
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:01,510
puzzle solving creative force that
underpins all of it it seems like I

7588
02:51:01,510 --> 02:51:01,520
underpins all of it it seems like I
 

7589
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:04,269
underpins all of it it seems like I
think we seek just like an llm seeks to

02:51:04,269 --> 02:51:04,279
think we seek just like an llm seeks to
 

7591
02:51:04,279 --> 02:51:06,229
think we seek just like an llm seeks to
minimize cross entropy between its

ability to predict or perceive um you
 

7607
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:26,229
ability to predict or perceive um you
know that's kind of an insult to us and

7608
02:51:26,229 --> 02:51:26,239
know that's kind of an insult to us and
 

7609
02:51:26,239 --> 02:51:29,030
know that's kind of an insult to us and
we we want to we want to be able to

it um and in general it's a capability
 

7617
02:51:39,120 --> 02:51:41,190
it um and in general it's a capability
that has evolved because the better you

02:51:41,190 --> 02:51:41,200
that has evolved because the better you
 

7619
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:43,670
that has evolved because the better you
can predict the world the better you can

02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:43,680
can predict the world the better you can

think quantum gravity again is kind of

7626
02:51:52,550 --> 02:51:52,560
think quantum gravity again is kind of
 

7627
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:54,990
think quantum gravity again is kind of
the the final boss uh in terms of

7628
02:51:54,990 --> 02:51:55,000
the the final boss uh in terms of
 

7629
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,950
the the final boss uh in terms of
knowledge acquisition um because once

7630
02:51:57,950 --> 02:51:57,960
knowledge acquisition um because once
 

7631
02:51:57,960 --> 02:51:59,830
knowledge acquisition um because once
we've mastered that then we

7632
02:51:59,830 --> 02:51:59,840
we've mastered that then we
 

7633
02:51:59,840 --> 02:52:03,670
we've mastered that then we
can do a lot potentially but between

7634
02:52:03,670 --> 02:52:03,680
can do a lot potentially but between
 

7635
02:52:03,680 --> 02:52:06,150
can do a lot potentially but between
here and there I think there's a lot to

7636
02:52:06,150 --> 02:52:06,160
here and there I think there's a lot to
 

7637
02:52:06,160 --> 02:52:08,150
here and there I think there's a lot to
learn in the mesos scales there's a lot

7638
02:52:08,150 --> 02:52:08,160
learn in the mesos scales there's a lot
 

7639
02:52:08,160 --> 02:52:10,150
learn in the mesos scales there's a lot
of information to acquire about our

7640
02:52:10,150 --> 02:52:10,160
of information to acquire about our
 

7641
02:52:10,160 --> 02:52:12,830
of information to acquire about our
world and a lot of engineering

7642
02:52:12,830 --> 02:52:12,840
world and a lot of engineering
 

7643

uh to climb up the cter shift scale and
 

7649
02:52:18,319 --> 02:52:20,710
uh to climb up the cter shift scale and
to us it's that's the great challenge of

02:52:20,710 --> 02:52:20,720
to us it's that's the great challenge of
 

7651
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:23,389
to us it's that's the great challenge of
