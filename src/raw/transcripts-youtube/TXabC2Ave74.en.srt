00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
and then I had to make decision as to
 

161
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,910
and then I had to make decision as to
whether to drop to the weight below

162
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
whether to drop to the weight below
 

163
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,750
whether to drop to the weight below
because I was seeded in the weight below

164
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
because I was seeded in the weight below
 

165
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,350
because I was seeded in the weight below
it was a different seeding then see and

166
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,360
it was a different seeding then see and
 

167
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,149
it was a different seeding then see and
um so I decided to drop into the weight

168
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:39,159
um so I decided to drop into the weight
 

169
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,670
um so I decided to drop into the weight
below because I was seated in the top

170
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
below because I was seated in the top
 

171
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,110
below because I was seated in the top
four and um as it happens I think it was

172
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,120
four and um as it happens I think it was
 

173
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,070
four and um as it happens I think it was
probably the worst decision I made well

174
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,080
probably the worst decision I made well
 

175
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,789
probably the worst decision I made well
because simply because I mean it was the

176
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:51,799
because simply because I mean it was the
 

177
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,949
because simply because I mean it was the
only contest that I lost was the final

178
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:53,959
only contest that I lost was the final
 

179
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,390
only contest that I lost was the final
of the Olympic Games in that year so

180
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
of the Olympic Games in that year so
 

181
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,390
of the Olympic Games in that year so
you're a young kid what like 1920 at

182
00:03:59,390 --> 00:03:59,400
you're a young kid what like 1920 at
 

183
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,630
you're a young kid what like 1920 at
that time full of confidence Vigor so

184
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
that time full of confidence Vigor so
 

185
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,190
that time full of confidence Vigor so
the decision to cut we how hard was it

186
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
the decision to cut we how hard was it
 

187
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,429
the decision to cut we how hard was it
for you to cut we to the 71 kg division

188
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:08,439
for you to cut we to the 71 kg division
 

189
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:11,110
for you to cut we to the 71 kg division
I've got to say that it was the hardest

190
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
I've got to say that it was the hardest
 

191
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,630
I've got to say that it was the hardest
because as I was going up I was you know

192
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:13,640
because as I was going up I was you know
 

193
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,670
because as I was going up I was you know
it was 73 then it was 74 kilos 75 so I

194
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
it was 73 then it was 74 kilos 75 so I
 

195
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,670
it was 73 then it was 74 kilos 75 so I
was moving through the weight category

196
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
was moving through the weight category
 

197
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,590
was moving through the weight category
it wasn't like I was stuck in the middle

198
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
it wasn't like I was stuck in the middle
 

199
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,550
it wasn't like I was stuck in the middle
and then I dropped the odd time to

200
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:23,560
and then I dropped the odd time to
 

201
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,310
and then I dropped the odd time to
compete it was literally going up in

202
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
compete it was literally going up in
 

203
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,510
compete it was literally going up in
weight um by a kilo every every month

204
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:30,520
weight um by a kilo every every month
 

205
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,790
weight um by a kilo every every month
and then by the time I came to a month

206
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
and then by the time I came to a month
 

207
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,830
and then by the time I came to a month
or two before the Olympics it was really

208
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
or two before the Olympics it was really
 

209
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,070
or two before the Olympics it was really
hard fought the European championships

210
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
hard fought the European championships
 

211
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,909
hard fought the European championships
at the higher weight category and won

212
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
at the higher weight category and won
 

213
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,510
at the higher weight category and won
that and so everybody that was in the on

214
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
that and so everybody that was in the on
 

215
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,790
that and so everybody that was in the on
the Olympic rostrom um at the um

216
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
the Olympic rostrom um at the um
 

217
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,710
the Olympic rostrom um at the um
European at the Olympic Games was on my

218
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:49,720
European at the Olympic Games was on my
 

219
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,070
European at the Olympic Games was on my
rostom at the European championships so

220
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,080
rostom at the European championships so
 

221
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,710
rostom at the European championships so
um was it a mistake yeah because I

222
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:55,720
um was it a mistake yeah because I
 

223
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,749
um was it a mistake yeah because I
didn't have my diet sorted out my

224
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
didn't have my diet sorted out my
 

225
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,350
didn't have my diet sorted out my
nutrition was appalling and when I you

226
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,360
nutrition was appalling and when I you
 

227
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,710
nutrition was appalling and when I you
know it wasn't as kind of readily

228
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
know it wasn't as kind of readily
 

229
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,950
know it wasn't as kind of readily
available as it is now for the nutrition

230
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:05,960
available as it is now for the nutrition
 

231
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,870
available as it is now for the nutrition
and I would say that if um anything lost

232
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:09,880
and I would say that if um anything lost
 

233
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,950
and I would say that if um anything lost
me that final other than the fact that I

234
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
me that final other than the fact that I

00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,789
thing but I you know I and the thing was
is that the more he tried and the harder

850
00:17:55,789 --> 00:17:55,799
is that the more he tried and the harder
 

851

is that the more he tried and the harder
he tried and the more he panicked the

traditional Judo people are more
standing up because that's the position

1016
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:18,400
standing up because that's the position
 

1017
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,710
standing up because that's the position
for which you can do the big throws and

1018

all that kind of stuff but uh I think
 

1021
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,029
all that kind of stuff but uh I think
the other case to make for uh Banning

1022
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
the other case to make for uh Banning
 

1023
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,909
the other case to make for uh Banning
leg grabs is you know a lot of people

1024
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:26,919
leg grabs is you know a lot of people
 

1025
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,590
leg grabs is you know a lot of people
are using it for stalling and not for

1026
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:28,600
are using it for stalling and not for
 

1027
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,190
are using it for stalling and not for
beautiful big throws and all that kind

1028
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,200
beautiful big throws and all that kind
 

1029
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,909
beautiful big throws and all that kind
of stuff so it's not just not to make it

1030
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:32,919
of stuff so it's not just not to make it
 

1031
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:35,590
of stuff so it's not just not to make it
different from wrestling it's it's also

1032
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:35,600
different from wrestling it's it's also
 

1033
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,350
different from wrestling it's it's also
like you want to maximize the amount of

1039
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:47,390
exciting stuff to watch right win by
Judo not not by wrestling and I think

1040
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:47,400

1041
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,269
Judo not not by wrestling and I think
that you know the ones that were

1042

that you know the ones that were
 

1043
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,590
that you know the ones that were
shouting about it were the wrestlers

1044
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:51,600
shouting about it were the wrestlers
 

1045
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,149
shouting about it were the wrestlers
right because they they they like to

1046
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:53,159
right because they they they like to
 

1047
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,669

so what basically I mean what what we've

1054
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:02,440
so what basically I mean what what we've
 

1055

doing both right but not from the other
 

1061
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:12,390
doing both right but not from the other
way around all right so rules always

1062
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:12,400
way around all right so rules always
 

1063
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,310
way around all right so rules always
dictate development they'll always

1064
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:14,320
dictate development they'll always
 

1065
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,269
dictate development they'll always
dictate which direction it goes so if

1066
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:17,279
dictate which direction it goes so if
 

1067
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,190
dictate which direction it goes so if
you introduce a rule that states that

1068
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,200
you introduce a rule that states that
 

1069
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,750
you introduce a rule that states that
you cannot dive at the legs and just

1070
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:22,760
you cannot dive at the legs and just
 

1071
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,310
you cannot dive at the legs and just
pick up um then you'll have to do it

1072
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
pick up um then you'll have to do it
 

1073
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,630
pick up um then you'll have to do it
standing up and also it increases the

1074
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640

1075
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,470
standing up and also it increases the
possibility of Defense with the hips

1076
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:31,480
possibility of Defense with the hips
 

1077

1364
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:53,960
your mind you're thinking um just don't
 

1365
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,909
your mind you're thinking um just don't
make mistakes but you know this is the

1366
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:55,919
make mistakes but you know this is the
 

1367
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,549
make mistakes but you know this is the
incredible thing is is that once you

1368
00:28:58,549 --> 00:28:58,559
incredible thing is is that once you
 

1369
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,909
incredible thing is is that once you
start to ask you what once I see contest

1370
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
start to ask you what once I see contest

change direction when I'm commentating

1372
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:04,720
change direction when I'm commentating
 

1373
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,990
change direction when I'm commentating
so I can see somebody who's in there

1374
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,000
so I can see somebody who's in there
 

1375
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,470
so I can see somebody who's in there
just going forward just trying to win

1376
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:09,480
just going forward just trying to win
 

1377
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,110
just going forward just trying to win
right so and that's a difference to

1378
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
right so and that's a difference to
 

1379
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,750
right so and that's a difference to
somebody who's trying not to lose MH and

1380
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
somebody who's trying not to lose MH and
 

1381
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,590
somebody who's trying not to lose MH and
it's two different ways there you know

1382
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:15,600
it's two different ways there you know
 

1383
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,389
it's two different ways there you know
so sometimes when you uh so when I was

1384
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:18,399
so sometimes when you uh so when I was
 

1385
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,110
so sometimes when you uh so when I was
world champion uh then I had a period of

1386
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
world champion uh then I had a period of
 

1387
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,909
world champion uh then I had a period of
time where every time I stepped out

1388
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:22,919
time where every time I stepped out
 

1389
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:27,350
time where every time I stepped out
there I was really afraid of losing and

1390
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
there I was really afraid of losing and
 

1391
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,269
there I was really afraid of losing and
um and I think that that's what happens

1392
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:30,279
um and I think that that's what happens
 

1393
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:32,870
um and I think that that's what happens
later on in your competitive career you

1394
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
later on in your competitive career you

stepping on the mat every single

1408
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
stepping on the mat every single
 

1409
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,509

00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:48,519
encounter you're trying to win you're
 

1411
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,630
encounter you're trying to win you're
looking for the grips and the with the

1412
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
looking for the grips and the with the
 

1413
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,710
looking for the grips and the with the
intention to throw throw big even when

1414
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:53,720
intention to throw throw big even when
 

1415
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,230
intention to throw throw big even when
you're ah head on points all that kind

1416
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:55,240
you're ah head on points all that kind
 

1417
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,669
you're ah head on points all that kind
of stuff that's a really good point is

1418
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
of stuff that's a really good point is
 

1419
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,110
of stuff that's a really good point is
that if you go ahead in a match and you

1420
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
that if you go ahead in a match and you
 

1421
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,950
that if you go ahead in a match and you
look at the clock it depends when you go

1422
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:02,960
look at the clock it depends when you go
 

1423
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,830
look at the clock it depends when you go
ahead like sometimes you can go ahead in

1424
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:04,840
ahead like sometimes you can go ahead in
 

1425
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,549
ahead like sometimes you can go ahead in
the first minute and you've still got

1426
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
the first minute and you've still got
 

1427
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,909
the first minute and you've still got
three minutes to go so I see the ones

1428
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:08,919
three minutes to go so I see the ones
 

1429
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:11,269
three minutes to go so I see the ones
then that go into I don't want to lose

1430
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
then that go into I don't want to lose
 

1431
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,909
then that go into I don't want to lose
because they go into defensive mode and

1432
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:12,919
because they go into defensive mode and
 

1433
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,909
because they go into defensive mode and
then sometimes they can lose it on

1434
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:14,919
then sometimes they can lose it on
 

1435
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:17,430
then sometimes they can lose it on
penalties or something can go wrong and

1436
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:17,440
penalties or something can go wrong and
 

1437
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,149
penalties or something can go wrong and
uh the other one comes on strong and

1438
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:19,159
uh the other one comes on strong and
 

1439
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:22,549
uh the other one comes on strong and
then they can sneak the contest and so

1440
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
then they can sneak the contest and so
 

1441
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,149
then they can sneak the contest and so
um it's it's really difficult but what

1442
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:25,159
um it's it's really difficult but what
 

1443
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,110
um it's it's really difficult but what

well you know um hours is a different
 

1557
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,149
well you know um hours is a different
intensity too like you just where where

1558
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:47,159
intensity too like you just where where
 

1559
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,950
intensity too like you just where where
you can take time a little bit hours is

1560
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:49,960
you can take time a little bit hours is
 

1561
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,190
you can take time a little bit hours is
bang it's transitioning from standing

1562
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,200
bang it's transitioning from standing
 

1563
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,070
bang it's transitioning from standing
down you've got 10 15 seconds to go in

1564
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,080
down you've got 10 15 seconds to go in
 

1565
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,830
down you've got 10 15 seconds to go in
there you go in 100% it's a bit like

1566
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:57,840
there you go in 100% it's a bit like
 

1567
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,870
there you go in 100% it's a bit like
running uh uh you know full out for 10

1568
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:00,880
running uh uh you know full out for 10
 

1569
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,190
running uh uh you know full out for 10
seconds like and then you've got to

1570
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
seconds like and then you've got to
 

1571
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,430
seconds like and then you've got to
decide then especially if they're

1572
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
decide then especially if they're
 

1573
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,830
decide then especially if they're
defending it whether you let it go

1574
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:08,840
defending it whether you let it go
 

1575
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,029
defending it whether you let it go
because when you get up and your

1576
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:10,039
because when you get up and your
 

1577
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,230
because when you get up and your
forearms are blown you know and you got

1578
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:12,240
forearms are blown you know and you got
 

1579
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,110
forearms are blown you know and you got
lactic acid in there and you still got

1580
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:14,120
lactic acid in there and you still got
 

1581
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,070
lactic acid in there and you still got
to grip up because remember ours is

1582
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
to grip up because remember ours is
 

1583
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,549
to grip up because remember ours is
about gripping as well on the jacket so

1584
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
about gripping as well on the jacket so
 

1585
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,470
about gripping as well on the jacket so
if you can't grip up then you can't gain

1586
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:20,480
if you can't grip up then you can't gain
 

1587
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,830
if you can't grip up then you can't gain
the advantage then they can throw you

1588
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:22,840
the advantage then they can throw you
 

1589
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,430
the advantage then they can throw you
you know so you have to decide so I had

1590
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:26,440
you know so you have to decide so I had
 

1591
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,269
you know so you have to decide so I had
a massive attack on him and we changed

1592
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:30,279
a massive attack on him and we changed
 

1593
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,830
a massive attack on him and we changed
directions four or five times and and

1594
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:32,840
directions four or five times and and
 

1595
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,509
directions four or five times and and
then I wasn't going to let him go but I

1596
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:35,519
then I wasn't going to let him go but I
 

1597
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,830
then I wasn't going to let him go but I
still you know when I was turning him

1598
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840

total Bridge trying to get out of it did

1644
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:27,879
total Bridge trying to get out of it did
 

1645
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:29,950
total Bridge trying to get out of it did
it start in turtle and like did you

1646
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:29,960
it start in turtle and like did you
 

1647
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,950
it start in turtle and like did you
started in Turtle because I I did an

1648
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:31,960
started in Turtle because I I did an
 

1649
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,629
started in Turtle because I I did an
attack came back out of the attack and

1650
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:34,639
attack came back out of the attack and

was on his back and then I started the

1654
00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:40,679
was on his back and then I started the
 

1655
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,909
was on his back and then I started the
whole saw opening you just went for it

1656
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:42,919
whole saw opening you just went for it
 

1657
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:44,589
whole saw opening you just went for it
just I was it was an automatic

1658
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:44,599
just I was it was an automatic
 

1659
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,270
just I was it was an automatic
transition so I mean the transitions are

1660
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:47,280
transition so I mean the transitions are
 

1661
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,310
transition so I mean the transitions are
what we teach you know because the ones

1662
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:49,320
what we teach you know because the ones
 

1663
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,389
what we teach you know because the ones
that are quicker down with the

1664
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
that are quicker down with the
 

1665
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,389
that are quicker down with the
transitions are the ones that catch it

1666
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399
transitions are the ones that catch it
 

1667
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,589
transitions are the ones that catch it
that's our naaza you know our groundwork

1668
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:54,599
that's our naaza you know our groundwork
 

1669
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,069
that's our naaza you know our groundwork
is the transition from standing down to

1670
00:34:57,069 --> 00:34:57,079
is the transition from standing down to
 

1671
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,230
is the transition from standing down to
ground it's very you know we don't have

1672
00:34:59,230 --> 00:34:59,240
ground it's very you know we don't have
 

1673
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,589
ground it's very you know we don't have
a situation where you can kind of work

1674
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:01,599
a situation where you can kind of work
 

1675
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,910
a situation where you can kind of work
your way in you are in or you're you're

1676
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:04,920
your way in you are in or you're you're
 

1677
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,910
your way in you are in or you're you're
not in you're standing you know so you

1678
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:06,920
not in you're standing you know so you
 

1679
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,630
not in you're standing you know so you
got to make sure that you're in and so I

1680
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:08,640
got to make sure that you're in and so I
 

1681
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,870
got to make sure that you're in and so I
had I was just on his back like a leech

1682
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
had I was just on his back like a leech
 

1683
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,910
had I was just on his back like a leech
and I never let him go so you I mean

1684
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:13,920
and I never let him go so you I mean
 

1685
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,470
and I never let him go so you I mean
yeah so that's where the arm bars that's

1686
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:15,480

without getting thrown in training here

1848
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
without getting thrown in training here
 

1849
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,589
without getting thrown in training here
in Europe and and I go to Japan and you

and and that's difficult to accept and
 

1855
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,510
and and that's difficult to accept and
the reason that kind of danger and that

1856
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:48,520
the reason that kind of danger and that
 

1857
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,589

that was first time when when I got a
 

1865

1905
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,349
like it's a terrifying calmness well at
least at least the experiences I've had

1906
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359

least at least the experiences I've had
you don't really feel it in the gripping

1908
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,040
you don't really feel it in the gripping
 

1909
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,670
you don't really feel it in the gripping
you just feel like anywhere you step

1910
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:50,680
you just feel like anywhere you step
 

1911
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,390
you just feel like anywhere you step
you're getting thrown it's a different

1912
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:53,400
you're getting thrown it's a different
 

1913
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,630
you're getting thrown it's a different
it's a different thing isn't it it's a

1914
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:54,640
it's a different thing isn't it it's a
 

1915
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,349
it's a different thing isn't it it's a
different thing so I mean mine was kind

1916
00:39:56,349 --> 00:39:56,359
different thing so I mean mine was kind
 

1917
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,950
different thing so I mean mine was kind
of a mixture right like it to be a

1918
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:57,960
of a mixture right like it to be a
 

1919
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,829
of a mixture right like it to be a
mixture because um there was um the

1920
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:00,839
mixture because um there was um the
 

1921
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,870
mixture because um there was um the
gripping is definitely the key point so

1922
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:03,880
gripping is definitely the key point so
 

1923
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,349
gripping is definitely the key point so
if you get a high level guys that are

1924
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:06,359
if you get a high level guys that are
 

1925
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:07,829
if you get a high level guys that are
gripping up and I always used to put

1926
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:07,839
gripping up and I always used to put
 

1927
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,030
gripping up and I always used to put
this to the

1928
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
this to the
 

1929
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,230
this to the
referees um when we were doing referee

1930
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,240
referees um when we were doing referee
 

1931
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,109
referees um when we were doing referee
seminars when we first started them and

1932
00:40:14,109 --> 00:40:14,119
seminars when we first started them and
 

1933
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,630
seminars when we first started them and
I'd say uh how many because like they

1934
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
I'd say uh how many because like they
 

1935
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,589
I'd say uh how many because like they
would referee to their understanding of

1936
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
would referee to their understanding of
 

1937
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,270
would referee to their understanding of
the match so they were penalizing for

1938
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:22,280
the match so they were penalizing for
 

1939
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,270
the match so they were penalizing for
certain grips that were you know and and

1940
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:24,280
certain grips that were you know and and
 

1941
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,270
certain grips that were you know and and
actually

1942
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,280
actually
 

1943
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,870
actually
so as an ex-athlete

1944
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:27,880
so as an ex-athlete
 

1945
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,550
so as an ex-athlete
uh high level I would say have you ever

1946
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
uh high level I would say have you ever
 

1947
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,510
uh high level I would say have you ever
gripped up with high level all right

1948
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
gripped up with high level all right
 

1949
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,390
gripped up with high level all right
because if you haven't you need to do it

1950
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:36,400
because if you haven't you need to do it
 

1951
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,710
because if you haven't you need to do it
because then you'll understand why they

1952
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
because then you'll understand why they
 

1953
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,510
because then you'll understand why they
do certain things with the grips because

1954
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:40,520
do certain things with the grips because
 

1955
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,270
do certain things with the grips because

the difference so then I
 

2051
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,030
the difference so then I
thought I better reciprocate this so I

single legging me and you know it was
 

2071
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:01,790
single legging me and you know it was
just totally different you know so it it

2072
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:01,800
just totally different you know so it it
 

2073
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,829
just totally different you know so it it
was uh like the jacket makes a massive

2074
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:04,839
was uh like the jacket makes a massive
 

2075
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:07,910
was uh like the jacket makes a massive
difference huge difference to uh

2076
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
difference huge difference to uh
 

2077
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,790
difference huge difference to uh
something you know and and people think

2078
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:10,800
something you know and and people think
 

2079
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,829
something you know and and people think
it's just a jacket that we're wearing

2080
00:43:12,829 --> 00:43:12,839
it's just a jacket that we're wearing
 

2081
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,430

but it it isn't it's it's our only um

2082
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:15,440
but it it isn't it's it's our only um
 

2083
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,430
but it it isn't it's it's our only um
tool actually yeah and it's control I

2084
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:18,440
tool actually yeah and it's control I
 

2085
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,190
tool actually yeah and it's control I
mean it's a way of establishing control

2086
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:20,200
mean it's a way of establishing control
 

2087
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,549
mean it's a way of establishing control
of another body and it's a whole art

2088
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:23,559
of another body and it's a whole art
 

2089
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,790
of another body and it's a whole art
form of Science and I don't even know if

2090
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:25,800
form of Science and I don't even know if
 

2091
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,630
form of Science and I don't even know if
you understand it really you understand

2092
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:27,640
you understand it really you understand
 

2093
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,790
you understand it really you understand
it sort of subconsciously through time

2094
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:31,800
it sort of subconsciously through time
 

2095
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,910
it sort of subconsciously through time
yeah cuz like it there so much involved

2096
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:33,920
yeah cuz like it there so much involved
 

2097
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,390
yeah cuz like it there so much involved
cuz pulling on one part of the jacket

2098
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:35,400
cuz pulling on one part of the jacket
 

2099
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,430
cuz pulling on one part of the jacket
pulls other parts of the jacket and yeah

2100
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,440
pulls other parts of the jacket and yeah
 

2101
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,829
pulls other parts of the jacket and yeah
like the physics of that is probably

2102
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:38,839
like the physics of that is probably
 

2103
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,150
like the physics of that is probably
insane to understand it's absolutely

2104
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,160
insane to understand it's absolutely
 

2105
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,630
insane to understand it's absolutely
insane and then you know they they

2106
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
insane and then you know they they
 

2107
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,510
insane and then you know they they
changed the rules for a little while and

2108
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:44,520
changed the rules for a little while and
 

2109
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,470
changed the rules for a little while and
they changed the rules so that you

2110
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:46,480
they changed the rules so that you
 

2111
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,750
they changed the rules so that you
couldn't hold uh you know that certain

2112
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
couldn't hold uh you know that certain
 

2113
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,230
couldn't hold uh you know that certain
uh grips were not allowed you only

2114
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:52,240
uh grips were not allowed you only
 

2115
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,030
uh grips were not allowed you only
allowed certain amount of time and there

2116
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:54,040
allowed certain amount of time and there
 

2117
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,670
allowed certain amount of time and there
were a lot of penalties for them you

2118
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
were a lot of penalties for them you
 

2119
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,270
were a lot of penalties for them you
know and then you know they had some of

2120
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:58,280
know and then you know they had some of
 

2121
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,470
know and then you know they had some of
the exf fighters into the referee

2122
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:00,480
the exf fighters into the referee
 

2123
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,430
the exf fighters into the referee
commission and so we were pushing for

2124
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:04,440
commission and so we were pushing for
 

2125
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,309
commission and so we were pushing for
just let them grip you know because

2126
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319
just let them grip you know because
 

2127
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,990
just let them grip you know because
that's that's that's our game you know

2128
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
that's that's that's our game you know
 

2129
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,870
that's that's that's our game you know
that's what makes his different you know

2130
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:09,880
that's what makes his different you know
 

2131
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,470
that's what makes his different you know
again if if grip up with somebody like

2132
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:12,480
again if if grip up with somebody like
 

2133
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,910
again if if grip up with somebody like
so they were on about uh Teddy Renee

sleeve yeah big arm over the top and and
then you know he throws people right so

2140
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:21,480
then you know he throws people right so
 

2141
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,829
then you know he throws people right so

the correct way doesn't mean that you've

2654
00:55:17,069 --> 00:55:17,079
the correct way doesn't mean that you've
 

2655
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:20,390
the correct way doesn't mean that you've
got to like it I didn't like it and uh I

got to like it I didn't like it and uh I
 

2657
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,470
got to like it I didn't like it and uh I
thought that I handled it certainly in

2658
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:23,480
thought that I handled it certainly in
 

2659
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,670
thought that I handled it certainly in
later years in the right way uh and I

2660
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:26,680
later years in the right way uh and I
 

2661
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,589
later years in the right way uh and I
like to see athletes do it in the right

2662
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:28,599
like to see athletes do it in the right
 

2663
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:30,710
like to see athletes do it in the right
way you know and I I think that's it's a

2664
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
way you know and I I think that's it's a
 

2665
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,470
way you know and I I think that's it's a
make or break situation it's not not all

2666
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:33,480
make or break situation it's not not all
 

2667
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,950
make or break situation it's not not all
the contests they win it's the one that

2668
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:34,960
the contests they win it's the one that
 

2669
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,630
the contests they win it's the one that
they lose and then how they pick

2670
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:36,640
they lose and then how they pick
 

2671
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,549
they lose and then how they pick
themselves up and handle themselves

2672
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
themselves up and handle themselves
 

2673
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:41,230
themselves up and handle themselves
after so I think um that that is a big

2674
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:41,240
after so I think um that that is a big
 

2675
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,789
after so I think um that that is a big
one for me and also I mean I I went

2676
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:44,799
one for me and also I mean I I went
 

2677
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,630
one for me and also I mean I I went
through you know obviously a later

2678
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:47,640
through you know obviously a later
 

2679
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,750
through you know obviously a later
divorce and um that was difficult on my

2680
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:50,760
divorce and um that was difficult on my
 

2681
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,750
divorce and um that was difficult on my
son really difficult on Ashley and then

2682
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:54,760
son really difficult on Ashley and then
 

2683
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,510
son really difficult on Ashley and then
I was and I think that some of that was

2684
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
I was and I think that some of that was
 

2685
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,789
I was and I think that some of that was
the fact that I was you know kind of I

2686
00:55:59,789 --> 00:55:59,799
the fact that I was you know kind of I
 

2687
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:01,870
the fact that I was you know kind of I
wasn't drinking all the time but I was

2688
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:01,880
wasn't drinking all the time but I was
 

2689
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,910
wasn't drinking all the time but I was
drinking in excess at the wrong times

2690
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:04,920
drinking in excess at the wrong times
 

2691
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,190
drinking in excess at the wrong times
you know and I think that that's what a

2692
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:06,200
you know and I think that that's what a
 

2693
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,910
you know and I think that that's what a
lot of people do sometimes is that they

2694

lot of people do sometimes is that they
 

2695

use it for the wrong reasons you know

00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:21,160
again and then um I think that that that
 

2747
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,270
again and then um I think that that that
was low and and I think that you what I

2748
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:23,280
was low and and I think that you what I
 

2749
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,430

decisions were when I was in that fuzzy

2752
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:28,760
decisions were when I was in that fuzzy
 

2753
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,549
decisions were when I was in that fuzzy
kind of haze and uh then it got

2754
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:31,559
kind of haze and uh then it got
 

2755
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:33,390
kind of haze and uh then it got
progressively worse that got

2756
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:33,400
progressively worse that got
 

2757
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,270
progressively worse that got
progressively worse uh to the degree

2758
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:36,280
progressively worse uh to the degree
 

2759
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,309
progressively worse uh to the degree
where it was you know trying to hide it

2760
00:57:39,309 --> 00:57:39,319
where it was you know trying to hide it
 

2761
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:42,710
where it was you know trying to hide it
and trying to hide how much uh and I was

that dark place the depression whether

2876
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:24,240
that dark place the depression whether
 

2877
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,549
that dark place the depression whether
it has to do with drinking or not

2878
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:26,559
it has to do with drinking or not
 

2879
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:27,950
it has to do with drinking or not
I think

2880
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:27,960
I think
 

2881
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,990
I think
um if it's to do with

2882
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:31,000
um if it's to do with
 

2883
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,390
um if it's to do with
drinking all I can say is is that the um

2884
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:35,400
drinking all I can say is is that the um
 

2885
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,430
drinking all I can say is is that the um
two days or a week into not drinking

2886
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:39,440
two days or a week into not drinking
 

2887
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,430
two days or a week into not drinking
you'll feel different you know it'll

2888
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:41,440
you'll feel different you know it'll
 

2889
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,270
you'll feel different you know it'll
make a physical difference and uh you'll

2890
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:44,280
make a physical difference and uh you'll
 

2891
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,510
make a physical difference and uh you'll
like that physical

2892
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:46,520
like that physical
 

2893
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:49,390
like that physical
difference and then from a mental

2894
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:49,400
difference and then from a mental
 

2895
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,589
difference and then from a mental
perspective as well because I think that

2896
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:51,599
perspective as well because I think that
 

2897
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,870
perspective as well because I think that

so I'd never touched a drug or even seen

01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:16,279
then somebody asked me to do an event
 

3201
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:18,870
then somebody asked me to do an event
and when you listen to the intonation of

3202
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:18,880
and when you listen to the intonation of
 

3203
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,349
and when you listen to the intonation of
the voice and stuff like that it wasn't

3204
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:21,359
the voice and stuff like that it wasn't
 

3205
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,829
the voice and stuff like that it wasn't
like it is now but I guess that's just

3206
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
like it is now but I guess that's just
 

3207
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,829
like it is now but I guess that's just
something that developed as I you know

3208
01:07:25,829 --> 01:07:25,839
something that developed as I you know
 

3209
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:27,029
something that developed as I you know
because then it was coming from the

3210
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:27,039
because then it was coming from the
 

3211
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,109
because then it was coming from the
heart MH and I you know started to get

3212
01:07:30,109 --> 01:07:30,119
heart MH and I you know started to get
 

3213
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:32,349
heart MH and I you know started to get
excited and just do my thing and it was

3214
01:07:32,349 --> 01:07:32,359
excited and just do my thing and it was
 

3215
01:07:32,359 --> 01:07:34,589
excited and just do my thing and it was
just me really just my style well I've

3216
01:07:34,589 --> 01:07:34,599

3221
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:41,150
back I don't know if it's the 80s but
it's still there I think it's timing as

it's still there I think it's timing as
 

3223
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:42,829
it's still there I think it's timing as

I think that in the early days I tended

3232
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:53,240
I think that in the early days I tended
 

3233
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,029
I think that in the early days I tended
to think uh I tended to want to talk all

01:07:56,029 --> 01:07:56,039
to think uh I tended to want to talk all
 

3235
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:58,910
to think uh I tended to want to talk all
the time and you don't have to do that

3236
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:58,920
the time and you don't have to do that
 

3237
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,630
the time and you don't have to do that
oh so knowing want to shut up that's the

3238
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:01,640
oh so knowing want to shut up that's the
 

3239
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,750
oh so knowing want to shut up that's the
key isn't it yeah part of the dramas and

3240
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:03,760
key isn't it yeah part of the dramas and
 

3241
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,430
key isn't it yeah part of the dramas and
the

3242
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:04,440
the
 

3243
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,670
the
silence building up to the to to the

3244
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:07,680
silence building up to the to to the
 

3245
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,150
silence building up to the to to the
setup and the throw and all that kind of

3246
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:09,160
setup and the throw and all that kind of
 

3247
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,390
setup and the throw and all that kind of
stuff but also you're very good

3248
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:11,400
stuff but also you're very good
 

3249
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,990
stuff but also you're very good
at while uh radiating passion being very

3250
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:16,000
at while uh radiating passion being very
 

3251
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,110
at while uh radiating passion being very
precise and specific about the details

3252
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:18,120
precise and specific about the details
 

3253
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,189
precise and specific about the details
of the throw and the setup and why

3254
01:08:20,189 --> 01:08:20,199
of the throw and the setup and why
 

3255
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:22,550
of the throw and the setup and why
something worked and didn't so yeah I

3256
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:22,560
something worked and didn't so yeah I
 

3257
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,309
something worked and didn't so yeah I
think I think there's two kinds of

3258
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:24,319
think I think there's two kinds of
 

3259
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:26,470
think I think there's two kinds of
commentating you can commentate what you

3260
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:26,480
commentating you can commentate what you
 

3261
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,430
commentating you can commentate what you
see and then you commentate what people

3262
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:30,440
see and then you commentate what people
 

3263
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,309
see and then you commentate what people
can't see you know and and so if you've

3264
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:32,319
can't see you know and and so if you've
 

3265
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,910
can't see you know and and so if you've
got somebody that is not really

3266
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:34,920
got somebody that is not really
 

3267
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,349
got somebody that is not really
understanding of what's happening in the

3268
01:08:36,349 --> 01:08:36,359

3269
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,870
understanding of what's happening in the
inner part of the game so it might be a

3270
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:38,880
inner part of the game so it might be a
 

3271
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,590
inner part of the game so it might be a
technical thing or it might be the

3272
01:08:41,590 --> 01:08:41,600
technical thing or it might be the
 

3273
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,070
technical thing or it might be the
Tactical part of the play here that's

think so
 

3503
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:29,390
think so
strong words you think so you think so

3504
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:29,400
strong words you think so you think so
 

3505
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:32,189
strong words you think so you think so
yamasha is on the shorter side right

3506
01:13:32,189 --> 01:13:32,199
yamasha is on the shorter side right
 

3507
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:34,070
yamasha is on the shorter side right
yeah and he he he finds it more

3508
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,080
yeah and he he he finds it more
 

3509
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,590
yeah and he he he finds it more
difficult with shorter people you know

3510
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
difficult with shorter people you know
 

3511
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,870
difficult with shorter people you know
and uh so it it was um it would have

3512
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:37,880
and uh so it it was um it would have
 

3513
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:40,750
and uh so it it was um it would have
been a very interesting uh confrontation

3514
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:40,760
been a very interesting uh confrontation
 

3515
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:44,310
been a very interesting uh confrontation
and I think if you asked

3516
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:44,320

01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,030
slightly different but the best fighters
adapt like that and and they're able to

3570
01:14:56,030 --> 01:14:56,040
adapt like that and and they're able to

they attack once and then go again and
attack second third time and in the

3576
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:04,880

Yasha and and Ted r with sari they'll
 

3581
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,350
Yasha and and Ted r with sari they'll
just like hit it over and over in the

3582
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:11,360
just like hit it over and over in the
 

3583
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,270
just like hit it over and over in the
match yeah sometimes he'll hit first

01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,280
match yeah sometimes he'll hit first
 

3585
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,229
match yeah sometimes he'll hit first
time and it won't go and then you make a

3586
01:15:15,229 --> 01:15:15,239
time and it won't go and then you make a
 

3587
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:17,390
time and it won't go and then you make a
Readjustment of the way in it's a little

3588
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:17,400
Readjustment of the way in it's a little
 

3589
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,790
Readjustment of the way in it's a little
bit like I mean if you take um a really

3590
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:19,800
bit like I mean if you take um a really
 

3591
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,709
bit like I mean if you take um a really
easy way of understanding it is that if

3592
01:15:21,709 --> 01:15:21,719
easy way of understanding it is that if
 

3593
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:25,629
easy way of understanding it is that if
we're shooting at a Target and all of a

3594
01:15:25,629 --> 01:15:25,639
we're shooting at a Target and all of a
 

3595
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:27,870
we're shooting at a Target and all of a
sudden you start moving that Target you

3596
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:27,880
sudden you start moving that Target you
 

3597
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,870
sudden you start moving that Target you
know it's different hitting a moving

3598
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:29,880
know it's different hitting a moving
 

3599
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,550
know it's different hitting a moving
Target but it's also different hitting a

3600
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:32,560
Target but it's also different hitting a
 

3601
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,270
Target but it's also different hitting a
moving Target that's trying to hit you

3602
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
moving Target that's trying to hit you
 

3603
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,669
moving Target that's trying to hit you
as well and that's our game right so

3604
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:37,679
as well and that's our game right so
 

3605
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,590
as well and that's our game right so
we're we're not only trying to throw a

3606
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
we're we're not only trying to throw a
 

3607
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,270
we're we're not only trying to throw a
moving Target we're trying to throw a

3608
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:41,280
moving Target we're trying to throw a
 

3609
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,629
moving Target we're trying to throw a
moving Target that's trying to throw us

3610
01:15:43,629 --> 01:15:43,639
moving Target that's trying to throw us
 

3611
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,430
moving Target that's trying to throw us
so that makes it even more difficult

3612
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
so that makes it even more difficult
 

3613
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,629
so that makes it even more difficult
yeah there's a there's a few folks

3614
01:15:47,629 --> 01:15:47,639
yeah there's a there's a few folks

to do a technique first thing I'd do is

3660
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:43,360
to do a technique first thing I'd do is
 

3661
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,149
to do a technique first thing I'd do is
say I need you to take a sleeve and a

3662

what was left and right okay cuz often
 

3667
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:55,550
what was left and right okay cuz often
what happens is we impart on people

3668
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:55,560
what happens is we impart on people
 

3669
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,669
what happens is we impart on people
whether they're going to be left or

3670
01:16:56,669 --> 01:16:56,679
whether they're going to be left or
 

3671
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:58,070
whether they're going to be left or
right when we start teaching you know

3672
01:16:58,070 --> 01:16:58,080
right when we start teaching you know
 

3673
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,070
right when we start teaching you know
you get a lot of teachers do that all

3674
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:00,080
you get a lot of teachers do that all
 

3675
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,590
you get a lot of teachers do that all
right and they'll say immediately are

3676
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
right and they'll say immediately are
 

3677
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,669
right and they'll say immediately are
you what do you right with left or right

3678
01:17:03,669 --> 01:17:03,679
you what do you right with left or right
 

3679
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:05,870
you what do you right with left or right
hand and it's no indicator actually as

3680
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:05,880
hand and it's no indicator actually as
 

3681
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,709
hand and it's no indicator actually as
to how we do Judo because I'm

3682
01:17:07,709 --> 01:17:07,719
to how we do Judo because I'm
 

3683
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:10,189
to how we do Judo because I'm
left-handed and I do more predominantly

3684
01:17:10,189 --> 01:17:10,199
left-handed and I do more predominantly
 

3685
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:13,110
left-handed and I do more predominantly
right-handed because I lead off my

3686
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120
right-handed because I lead off my
 

3687
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,629
right-handed because I lead off my
strongest hand and actually most people

3688
01:17:15,629 --> 01:17:15,639
strongest hand and actually most people
 

3689
01:17:15,639 --> 01:17:18,350
strongest hand and actually most people
do you know so actually left and right

3690
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:18,360
do you know so actually left and right
 

3691
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,229
do you know so actually left and right
is a bit of a trap sometimes you know

3692
01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
is a bit of a trap sometimes you know
 

3693
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:23,030
is a bit of a trap sometimes you know
when we're teaching better to get you

3694
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:23,040
when we're teaching better to get you
 

3695
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,430
when we're teaching better to get you
know because we can go so my point was

3696
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:26,440
know because we can go so my point was
 

3697
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,750
know because we can go so my point was
is that a lot of people can go both

3698
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:28,760
is that a lot of people can go both
 

3699
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,950
is that a lot of people can go both
flanks so they'll do something over this

3700
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:30,960
flanks so they'll do something over this
 

3701
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,870
flanks so they'll do something over this
side and something over this side but

3702
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:32,880
side and something over this side but
 

3703
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,910
side and something over this side but
anyway was one-sided he was one-sided

3704
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:35,920
anyway was one-sided he was one-sided
 

3705
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,910
anyway was one-sided he was one-sided
but he could he could switch it so he

3706
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:37,920
but he could he could switch it so he
 

3707
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,110
but he could he could switch it so he
had a um a cagi as well on the other

3708
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:41,120
had a um a cagi as well on the other
 

3709
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,070
had a um a cagi as well on the other
side so he could switch it if he had to

3710
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:43,080
side so he could switch it if he had to
 

3711
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,790
side so he could switch it if he had to
interesting yeah and uh by the way your

3712
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:45,800
interesting yeah and uh by the way your
 

3713
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,070
interesting yeah and uh by the way your
opponent in

3714
01:17:47,070 --> 01:17:47,080

like that yeah you would think it'd take
 

5007
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,910
like that yeah you would think it'd take
a long time no it was like a month yeah

01:45:34,589 --> 01:45:34,599
that you've observed because you're uh
 

5019
01:45:34,599 --> 01:45:36,870
that you've observed because you're uh
one of the greatest ever uh on the on

5020
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:36,880
one of the greatest ever uh on the on
 

5021
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:39,109
one of the greatest ever uh on the on
the ground in

5022
01:45:39,109 --> 01:45:39,119
the ground in
 

5023
01:45:39,119 --> 01:45:43,350
the ground in
Judo and so you know jiujitsu is

5024
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:43,360
Judo and so you know jiujitsu is
 

5025
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:46,109
Judo and so you know jiujitsu is
primarily focused on similar type of

5026
01:45:46,109 --> 01:45:46,119
primarily focused on similar type of
 

5027
01:45:46,119 --> 01:45:48,109
primarily focused on similar type of
stuff on the ground so what do you is an

5028
01:45:48,109 --> 01:45:48,119
stuff on the ground so what do you is an
 

5029
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:49,709
stuff on the ground so what do you is an
interesting difference there they're

5030
01:45:49,709 --> 01:45:49,719
interesting difference there they're
 

5031
01:45:49,719 --> 01:45:52,310
interesting difference there they're
different approach different time scale

5032
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:52,320
different approach different time scale
 

5033
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,550
different approach different time scale
to to them and they have a different way

5034
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:54,560
to to them and they have a different way
 

5035
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:58,390
to to them and they have a different way
in so um like ours comes from a standing

5036
01:45:58,390 --> 01:45:58,400
in so um like ours comes from a standing
 

5037
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:01,109
in so um like ours comes from a standing
position directly in we've got a time

5038
01:46:01,109 --> 01:46:01,119
position directly in we've got a time
 

5039
01:46:01,119 --> 01:46:04,109
position directly in we've got a time
scale on it so we we have to like the

5040
01:46:04,109 --> 01:46:04,119
scale on it so we we have to like the
 

5041
01:46:04,119 --> 01:46:06,390
scale on it so we we have to like the
catch what I always I always talk about

5042
01:46:06,390 --> 01:46:06,400
catch what I always I always talk about
 

5043
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:09,550
catch what I always I always talk about
the catch because in Jito terms if you

5044
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:09,560
the catch because in Jito terms if you
 

5045
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:12,550
the catch because in Jito terms if you
don't get the catch immediately then the

5046
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:12,560
don't get the catch immediately then the
 

5047
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,470
don't get the catch immediately then the
referee won't see the the transition in

5048
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:16,480
referee won't see the the transition in
 

5049
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:20,149
referee won't see the the transition in
and also the uh continuation from plan A

5050
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:20,159
and also the uh continuation from plan A
 

5051
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:23,709
and also the uh continuation from plan A
B C D you know if something buil builds

5052
01:46:23,709 --> 01:46:23,719
B C D you know if something buil builds
 

5053
01:46:23,719 --> 01:46:26,910
B C D you know if something buil builds
so we have to build it and we uh we have

5054
01:46:26,910 --> 01:46:26,920
so we have to build it and we uh we have
 

5055
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:28,550
so we have to build it and we uh we have
to build it quickly and I think in

5056
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:28,560
to build it quickly and I think in
 

5057
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,629
to build it quickly and I think in
Jiu-Jitsu terms you have more time to

5058
01:46:31,629 --> 01:46:31,639
Jiu-Jitsu terms you have more time to
 

5059
01:46:31,639 --> 01:46:33,910
Jiu-Jitsu terms you have more time to
build yeah there's a there's a kind of

5060
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:33,920
build yeah there's a there's a kind of
 

5061
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,669
build yeah there's a there's a kind of
patience like oh if this doesn't work

5062
01:46:35,669 --> 01:46:35,679
patience like oh if this doesn't work
 

5063
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:37,709
patience like oh if this doesn't work
out I can try a different thing yeah

5064
01:46:37,709 --> 01:46:37,719
out I can try a different thing yeah
 

5065
01:46:37,719 --> 01:46:40,510
out I can try a different thing yeah
with Judo there's like an urgency like

5066
01:46:40,510 --> 01:46:40,520
with Judo there's like an urgency like
 

5067
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:43,550
with Judo there's like an urgency like
every s and there's a ref watching

5068
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:43,560
every s and there's a ref watching
 

5069
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,870
every s and there's a ref watching
skeptically so you better show that

5070
01:46:45,870 --> 01:46:45,880
skeptically so you better show that
 

5071
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:47,589
skeptically so you better show that
you're making progress you've got to

5072
01:46:47,589 --> 01:46:47,599
you're making progress you've got to
 

5073
01:46:47,599 --> 01:46:49,470
you're making progress you've got to
show the progression and that's why you

5074
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:49,480
show the progression and that's why you
 

5075
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:52,229
show the progression and that's why you
know I always had a plan A B C you see

5076
01:46:52,229 --> 01:46:52,239
know I always had a plan A B C you see
 

5077
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:53,510
know I always had a plan A B C you see
there with

5078
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:53,520
there with
 

5079
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,310
there with
you know that was 1981 there the great

5080
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:56,320
you know that was 1981 there the great
 

5081
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:59,669
you know that was 1981 there the great
cash was Zaki was had um had a

5082
01:46:59,669 --> 01:46:59,679
cash was Zaki was had um had a
 

5083
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,830
cash was Zaki was had um had a
progression you know everything was he

5084
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:01,840
progression you know everything was he
 

5085
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:03,709
progression you know everything was he
knew exactly where he had to be it was

5086
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:03,719
knew exactly where he had to be it was
 

5087
01:47:03,719 --> 01:47:06,149
knew exactly where he had to be it was
feel you know that wasn't by accident it

5088
01:47:06,149 --> 01:47:06,159
feel you know that wasn't by accident it
 

5089
01:47:06,159 --> 01:47:10,070
feel you know that wasn't by accident it
was it was trained and I think that that

5090
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:10,080
was it was trained and I think that that
 

5091
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,070
was it was trained and I think that that
transition there and taking uh control

5092
01:47:13,070 --> 01:47:13,080
transition there and taking uh control
 

5093
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,589
transition there and taking uh control
of somebody's mistake so somebody might

5094
01:47:15,589 --> 01:47:15,599
of somebody's mistake so somebody might
 

5095
01:47:15,599 --> 01:47:18,510
of somebody's mistake so somebody might
have made a mistake or not hit properly

5096
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:18,520
have made a mistake or not hit properly
 

5097
01:47:18,520 --> 01:47:20,550
have made a mistake or not hit properly
or your defense has caused them to make

5098
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:20,560
or your defense has caused them to make
 

5099
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:22,669
or your defense has caused them to make
a mistake and then you take advantage of

5100
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:22,679
a mistake and then you take advantage of
 

5101
01:47:22,679 --> 01:47:25,270
a mistake and then you take advantage of
it and that that is the difference so

5102
01:47:25,270 --> 01:47:25,280
it and that that is the difference so
 

5103
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:27,470
it and that that is the difference so
one of the side effects of that I don't

5104
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:27,480
one of the side effects of that I don't
 

5105
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:30,070
one of the side effects of that I don't
know with the chicken or the egg but uh

5106
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:30,080
know with the chicken or the egg but uh
 

5107
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,189
know with the chicken or the egg but uh
Judo people on the ground are much more

5108
01:47:33,189 --> 01:47:33,199
Judo people on the ground are much more
 

5109
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:35,910
Judo people on the ground are much more
aggressive so probably because of the

5110
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:35,920
aggressive so probably because of the
 

5111
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,910
aggressive so probably because of the
urgency but just like there's an

5112
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:37,920
urgency but just like there's an
 

5113
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:40,709
urgency but just like there's an
intention behind the the progress you're

5114
01:47:40,709 --> 01:47:40,719
intention behind the the progress you're
 

5115
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:42,790
intention behind the the progress you're
making I think

5116
01:47:42,790 --> 01:47:42,800
making I think
 

5117
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:45,790
making I think
Jiu-Jitsu uh is more relaxed there's

5118
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:45,800
Jiu-Jitsu uh is more relaxed there's
 

5119
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:49,390
Jiu-Jitsu uh is more relaxed there's
more uh a culture of just finding places

5120
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:49,400
more uh a culture of just finding places
 

5121
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:51,669
more uh a culture of just finding places
to relax and think of different control

5122
01:47:51,669 --> 01:47:51,679
to relax and think of different control
 

5123
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:53,310
to relax and think of different control
and positions and take your time time

5124
01:47:53,310 --> 01:47:53,320
and positions and take your time time
 

5125
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:55,149
and positions and take your time time
and as a result it's much much less

5126
01:47:55,149 --> 01:47:55,159
and as a result it's much much less
 

5127
01:47:55,159 --> 01:47:57,790
and as a result it's much much less
exhausting so you can go for much longer

5128
01:47:57,790 --> 01:47:57,800
exhausting so you can go for much longer
 

5129
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:59,510
exhausting so you can go for much longer
feels like

5130
01:47:59,510 --> 01:47:59,520
feels like
 

5131
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,350
feels like
Judo is exhausting it's that 10c blast

5132
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:03,360
Judo is exhausting it's that 10c blast
 

5133
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:04,870
Judo is exhausting it's that 10c blast
isn't it you know it's it's it's like

5134
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:04,880
isn't it you know it's it's it's like
 

5135
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:08,510
isn't it you know it's it's it's like
doing sprints all the time you know and

5136
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:08,520
doing sprints all the time you know and
 

5137
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:10,270
doing sprints all the time you know and
that that is really hard and that's a

5138
01:48:10,270 --> 01:48:10,280
that that is really hard and that's a
 

5139
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,350
that that is really hard and that's a
special kind of condition you need and

5140
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:12,360
special kind of condition you need and
 

5141
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,910
special kind of condition you need and
you need to be able to catch it and know

5142
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:14,920

actually know if people in jit have made
sense of that like loaded that in but

5358
01:52:44,990 --> 01:52:45,000
sense of that like loaded that in but
 

5359
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,550
sense of that like loaded that in but
it's not part of it's not part of the

5360
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:47,560
it's not part of it's not part of the
 

5361
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,950
it's not part of it's not part of the
game is it you know it the pin it's

5362
01:52:49,950 --> 01:52:49,960
game is it you know it the pin it's
 

5363
01:52:49,960 --> 01:52:53,189
game is it you know it the pin it's
submission yeah but you know

5364
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:53,199
submission yeah but you know
 

5365
01:52:53,199 --> 01:52:56,229
submission yeah but you know
control is part of the game and nobody

5366
01:52:56,229 --> 01:52:56,239
control is part of the game and nobody
 

5367
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:59,030
control is part of the game and nobody
controls a human body the way Judo

5368
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,040
controls a human body the way Judo
 

5369
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:01,790
controls a human body the way Judo
people do on the ground like they have

5370
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:01,800
people do on the ground like they have
 

5371
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,030
people do on the ground like they have
understood the science of control and I

5372
01:53:04,030 --> 01:53:04,040
understood the science of control and I
 

5373
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:06,430
understood the science of control and I
think that's control is extremely useful

5374
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:06,440
think that's control is extremely useful
 

5375
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:09,709
think that's control is extremely useful
in um Jiu-Jitsu as well just that people

5376
01:53:09,709 --> 01:53:09,719
in um Jiu-Jitsu as well just that people
 

5377
01:53:09,719 --> 01:53:11,470
in um Jiu-Jitsu as well just that people
don't because there's so many other

5378
01:53:11,470 --> 01:53:11,480
don't because there's so many other
 

5379
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:14,030
don't because there's so many other
domains of exploration but the that's

5380
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:14,040
domains of exploration but the that's
 

5381
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:16,750
domains of exploration but the that's
interesting I mean just and especially

5382
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:16,760
interesting I mean just and especially
 

5383
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:19,030
interesting I mean just and especially
when you apply Jiu-Jitsu to U the

5384
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:19,040
when you apply Jiu-Jitsu to U the
 

5385
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,910
when you apply Jiu-Jitsu to U the
fighting setting so mixed martial arts

5386
01:53:21,910 --> 01:53:21,920
fighting setting so mixed martial arts
 

5387
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,830
fighting setting so mixed martial arts
that control control that side control

5388
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:23,840
that control control that side control
 

5389
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,030
that control control that side control
that pin control is really really really

5390
01:53:26,030 --> 01:53:26,040
that pin control is really really really
 

5391
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:28,589
that pin control is really really really
important so but then you add punching

5392
01:53:28,589 --> 01:53:28,599
important so but then you add punching
 

5393
01:53:28,599 --> 01:53:30,629
important so but then you add punching
to the thing and it becomes that puts a

5394
01:53:30,629 --> 01:53:30,639
to the thing and it becomes that puts a
 

5395
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:32,310
to the thing and it becomes that puts a
whole different uh thing on it doesn't

5396
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:32,320
whole different uh thing on it doesn't
 

5397
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:33,790
whole different uh thing on it doesn't
it I mean there's an alternate history

5398
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:33,800
it I mean there's an alternate history
 

5399
01:53:33,800 --> 01:53:35,069
it I mean there's an alternate history
where you would have been part of the

5400
01:53:35,069 --> 01:53:35,079
where you would have been part of the
 

5401
01:53:35,079 --> 01:53:37,589
where you would have been part of the
early UFC's if time was a little

5402
01:53:37,589 --> 01:53:37,599
early UFC's if time was a little
 

5403
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:39,030
early UFC's if time was a little
different you

5404
01:53:39,030 --> 01:53:39,040
different you
 

5405
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:42,470
different you
know uh maybe a few years

5406
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:42,480
know uh maybe a few years
 

5407
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:46,950
know uh maybe a few years
later cuz your your your style of Judo

5408
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:46,960
later cuz your your your style of Judo
 

5409
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,310
later cuz your your your style of Judo
and Jiu-Jitsu and the and the

5410
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:48,320
and Jiu-Jitsu and the and the
 

5411
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,950
and Jiu-Jitsu and the and the
Transitions and the aggression and the

5412
01:53:50,950 --> 01:53:50,960
Transitions and the aggression and the
 

5413
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,149
Transitions and the aggression and the
all of that would have worked really

5414
01:53:52,149 --> 01:53:52,159
all of that would have worked really
 

5415
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:54,189
all of that would have worked really
well in the early UFC's I'm sure I was

5416
01:53:54,189 --> 01:53:54,199
well in the early UFC's I'm sure I was
 

5417
01:53:54,199 --> 01:53:56,390
well in the early UFC's I'm sure I was
being set up at one stage by one of The

5418
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:56,400
being set up at one stage by one of The
 

5419
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:59,790
being set up at one stage by one of The
Graces um and that was when um when he

5420
01:53:59,790 --> 01:53:59,800
Graces um and that was when um when he
 

5421
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:03,109
Graces um and that was when um when he
was winning all the matches but he came

5422
01:54:03,109 --> 01:54:03,119
was winning all the matches but he came
 

5423
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:05,669
was winning all the matches but he came
him with with a couple of the cousins to

5424
01:54:05,669 --> 01:54:05,679

one of my seminars yeah and uh he was
 

5427
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:13,950
one of my seminars yeah and uh he was
one of the first ones wasn't he that uh

5428
01:54:13,950 --> 01:54:13,960
one of the first ones wasn't he that uh
 

5429
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,629
one of the first ones wasn't he that uh
that that's how I love to see the kind

5430
01:54:16,629 --> 01:54:16,639
that that's how I love to see the kind
 

5431
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:19,109
that that's how I love to see the kind
of UFC because it was different martial

5432
01:54:19,109 --> 01:54:19,119
of UFC because it was different martial
 

5433
01:54:19,119 --> 01:54:21,030
of UFC because it was different martial
arts different skills and you know I

5434
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:21,040
arts different skills and you know I
 

5435
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:24,069
arts different skills and you know I
mean he he'd get close and he just choke

5436
01:54:24,069 --> 01:54:24,079
mean he he'd get close and he just choke
 

5437
01:54:24,079 --> 01:54:26,030
mean he he'd get close and he just choke
them out or arm locked them or you know

5438
01:54:26,030 --> 01:54:26,040
them out or arm locked them or you know
 

5439
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:28,750
them out or arm locked them or you know
armar them and that was uh that was

5440
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:28,760
armar them and that was uh that was
 

5441
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:30,709
armar them and that was uh that was
brilliant you know that was for me that

5442
01:54:30,709 --> 01:54:30,719
brilliant you know that was for me that
 

5443
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:33,510
brilliant you know that was for me that
was a revelation that was how I saw it

5444
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:33,520
was a revelation that was how I saw it
 

5445
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,149
was a revelation that was how I saw it
yeah and it's a fascinating science

5446
01:54:35,149 --> 01:54:35,159
yeah and it's a fascinating science
 

5447
01:54:35,159 --> 01:54:36,870
yeah and it's a fascinating science
experiment of which aspects of different

5448
01:54:36,870 --> 01:54:36,880
experiment of which aspects of different
 

5449
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:39,350
experiment of which aspects of different
martial arts work well and not when they

5450
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:39,360
martial arts work well and not when they
 

5451
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:41,669
martial arts work well and not when they
clashed together and it it did turn out

5452
01:54:41,669 --> 01:54:41,679
clashed together and it it did turn out
 

5453
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:42,669
clashed together and it it did turn out
that

5454
01:54:42,669 --> 01:54:42,679
that
 

5455
01:54:42,679 --> 01:54:45,229
that
nawaza worked well was the key yeah it

5456
01:54:45,229 --> 01:54:45,239
nawaza worked well was the key yeah it
 

5457
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:46,950
nawaza worked well was the key yeah it
was the key wasn't it yeah yeah it was a

5458
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:46,960
was the key wasn't it yeah yeah it was a
 

5459
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:48,990
was the key wasn't it yeah yeah it was a
it was a big Missing Link in our

5460
01:54:48,990 --> 01:54:49,000
it was a big Missing Link in our
 

5461
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,069
it was a big Missing Link in our
conception of fighting it's the

5462
01:54:51,069 --> 01:54:51,079
conception of fighting it's the
 

5463
01:54:51,079 --> 01:54:53,470
conception of fighting it's the
neutralizer of s

5464
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:53,480
neutralizer of s
 

5465
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:55,390
neutralizer of s
and a lot of other components and it

5466
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:55,400
and a lot of other components and it
 

5467
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:58,229
and a lot of other components and it
just blew people's mind like okay it's

5468
01:54:58,229 --> 01:54:58,239
just blew people's mind like okay it's
 

5469
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:00,030
just blew people's mind like okay it's
not just about size it's not just about

5470
01:55:00,030 --> 01:55:00,040
not just about size it's not just about
 

5471
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:03,069
not just about size it's not just about
big big guys

5472
01:55:03,069 --> 01:55:03,079

what are we talking about Uchi comi
doing a bunch of f working with bands

5778
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:20,480
doing a bunch of f working with bands
 

5779
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:22,229
doing a bunch of f working with bands
are you doing throws are you actually

5780
02:01:22,229 --> 02:01:22,239
are you doing throws are you actually
 

5781
02:01:22,239 --> 02:01:24,430
are you doing throws are you actually
just having conversations about like

5782
02:01:24,430 --> 02:01:24,440
just having conversations about like
 

5783
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:26,629
just having conversations about like
specific like tiny details of throws

5784
02:01:26,629 --> 02:01:26,639
specific like tiny details of throws
 

5785
02:01:26,639 --> 02:01:28,109
specific like tiny details of throws
like what what does skills mean all

5786
02:01:28,109 --> 02:01:28,119
like what what does skills mean all
 

5787
02:01:28,119 --> 02:01:30,149
like what what does skills mean all
those things about doing your repetition

5788
02:01:30,149 --> 02:01:30,159
those things about doing your repetition
 

5789
02:01:30,159 --> 02:01:32,189
those things about doing your repetition
practice making sure the repetition is

5790
02:01:32,189 --> 02:01:32,199
practice making sure the repetition is
 

5791
02:01:32,199 --> 02:01:34,589
practice making sure the repetition is
correct you know there good repetition

5792
02:01:34,589 --> 02:01:34,599
correct you know there good repetition
 

5793
02:01:34,599 --> 02:01:36,589
correct you know there good repetition
so when we say good repetition does it

5794
02:01:36,589 --> 02:01:36,599
so when we say good repetition does it
 

5795
02:01:36,599 --> 02:01:38,109
so when we say good repetition does it
would you call me when you just fitting

5796
02:01:38,109 --> 02:01:38,119
would you call me when you just fitting
 

5797
02:01:38,119 --> 02:01:39,950
would you call me when you just fitting
the throw versus doing the throw where

5798
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:39,960
the throw versus doing the throw where
 

5799
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:41,950
the throw versus doing the throw where
do you land on the value and getting it

5800
02:01:41,950 --> 02:01:41,960
do you land on the value and getting it
 

5801
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,470
do you land on the value and getting it
moving you know so one of the biggest

5802
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:43,480
moving you know so one of the biggest
 

5803
02:01:43,480 --> 02:01:44,990
moving you know so one of the biggest
most important things is getting it

5804
02:01:44,990 --> 02:01:45,000
most important things is getting it
 

5805
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,709
most important things is getting it
moving uh if we do something static

5806
02:01:47,709 --> 02:01:47,719
moving uh if we do something static
 

5807
02:01:47,719 --> 02:01:49,589
moving uh if we do something static
again it's that static Target you need

5808
02:01:49,589 --> 02:01:49,599
again it's that static Target you need
 

5809
02:01:49,599 --> 02:01:51,350
again it's that static Target you need
to get it moving so you need to do a

5810
02:01:51,350 --> 02:01:51,360
to get it moving so you need to do a
 

5811
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,510
to get it moving so you need to do a
repetition

5812
02:01:52,510 --> 02:01:52,520
repetition
 

5813
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,709
repetition
and also you need to do a correct

5814
02:01:54,709 --> 02:01:54,719
and also you need to do a correct
 

5815
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:57,350
and also you need to do a correct
repetition because if you're doing 100

5816
02:01:57,350 --> 02:01:57,360
repetition because if you're doing 100
 

5817
02:01:57,360 --> 02:02:00,870
repetition because if you're doing 100
the repetitions that are not correct and

5818
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:00,880
the repetitions that are not correct and
 

5819
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,189
the repetitions that are not correct and
repetitions under pressure too much

5820
02:02:03,189 --> 02:02:03,199
repetitions under pressure too much
 

5821
02:02:03,199 --> 02:02:06,109
repetitions under pressure too much
pressure without somebody overseeing

5822
02:02:06,109 --> 02:02:06,119
pressure without somebody overseeing
 

5823
02:02:06,119 --> 02:02:08,350
pressure without somebody overseeing
those skills to make sure that that that

5824
02:02:08,350 --> 02:02:08,360
those skills to make sure that that that
 

5825
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,629
those skills to make sure that that that
you correct the skills because if you're

5826
02:02:10,629 --> 02:02:10,639
you correct the skills because if you're
 

5827
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:13,310
you correct the skills because if you're
doing a skill if you're doing it uh 99

5828
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:13,320
doing a skill if you're doing it uh 99
 

5829
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:16,669
doing a skill if you're doing it uh 99
times incorrectly all right then uh

5830
02:02:16,669 --> 02:02:16,679
times incorrectly all right then uh
 

5831
02:02:16,679 --> 02:02:18,310
times incorrectly all right then uh
repetition doesn't make perfect

5832
02:02:18,310 --> 02:02:18,320
repetition doesn't make perfect
 

5833
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:21,470
repetition doesn't make perfect
repetition makes permanent so you got to

5834
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:21,480
repetition makes permanent so you got to
 

5835
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:23,510
repetition makes permanent so you got to
make it per as perfect as you possibly

5836
02:02:23,510 --> 02:02:23,520
make it per as perfect as you possibly
 

5837
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:26,950
make it per as perfect as you possibly
can so actually that skills group there

5838
02:02:26,950 --> 02:02:26,960
can so actually that skills group there
 

5839
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,470
can so actually that skills group there
is the most important thing and what I

5840
02:02:28,470 --> 02:02:28,480
is the most important thing and what I
 

5841
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:31,790
is the most important thing and what I
used to do is oversee it so I'd oversee

5842
02:02:31,790 --> 02:02:31,800
used to do is oversee it so I'd oversee
 

5843
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:33,270
used to do is oversee it so I'd oversee
it to make sure that it was done

5844
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:33,280
it to make sure that it was done
 

5845
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,750
it to make sure that it was done
properly so you're watching the the

5846
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:34,760
properly so you're watching the the
 

5847
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:37,270
properly so you're watching the the
footwork you're watching the gripping

5848
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:37,280
footwork you're watching the gripping
 

5849
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:40,069
footwork you're watching the gripping
and then just constantly adjusting

5850
02:02:40,069 --> 02:02:40,079
and then just constantly adjusting
 

5851
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:43,270
and then just constantly adjusting
people I give you an example Jimmy Pedro

5852
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:43,280
people I give you an example Jimmy Pedro
 

5853
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:44,950
people I give you an example Jimmy Pedro
Jimmy was one of the hardest when he was

5854
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:44,960
Jimmy was one of the hardest when he was
 

5855
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:48,870
Jimmy was one of the hardest when he was
19 years of age right so I was he always

5856

so everybody went on with him you know
 

5875
02:03:12,159 --> 02:03:14,589
so everybody went on with him you know
and and so it only improved their game

5876
02:03:14,589 --> 02:03:14,599
and and so it only improved their game
 

5877
02:03:14,599 --> 02:03:16,629
and and so it only improved their game
and it improved him and then with you

and it improved him and then with you
 

5879
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:18,510
and it improved him and then with you
know small technical things that have

5880
02:03:18,510 --> 02:03:18,520
know small technical things that have
 

5881
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:20,790
know small technical things that have
stayed with him that we were doing with

5882
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:20,800
stayed with him that we were doing with
 

5883
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:22,550
stayed with him that we were doing with
the juji katami that it's passed on to

5884
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:22,560
the juji katami that it's passed on to
 

5885
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,790
the juji katami that it's passed on to
Kayla and then gone on you know to Ronda

5886
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:24,800
Kayla and then gone on you know to Ronda
 

5887
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,109
Kayla and then gone on you know to Ronda
and it's all small things that I can see

5888
02:03:28,109 --> 02:03:28,119
and it's all small things that I can see
 

5889
02:03:28,119 --> 02:03:30,790
and it's all small things that I can see
sometimes that you know it's passed on

5890
02:03:30,790 --> 02:03:30,800
sometimes that you know it's passed on
 

5891
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:32,830
sometimes that you know it's passed on
what about the taosi he said he learned

5892
02:03:32,830 --> 02:03:32,840
what about the taosi he said he learned
 

5893
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:34,790
what about the taosi he said he learned
a lot from you from that thr and he does

5894
02:03:34,790 --> 02:03:34,800
a lot from you from that thr and he does
 

5895
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:36,550
a lot from you from that thr and he does
it differently and so I should mention

5896
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:36,560
it differently and so I should mention
 

5897
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:37,870
it differently and so I should mention
that's one of the

5898
02:03:37,870 --> 02:03:37,880
that's one of the
 

5899
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,589
that's one of the
trickier uh throw I mean I don't I still

5900
02:03:40,589 --> 02:03:40,599
trickier uh throw I mean I don't I still
 

5901
02:03:40,599 --> 02:03:43,870
trickier uh throw I mean I don't I still
don't understand it is I don't

5902
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:43,880
don't understand it is I don't
 

5903
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:45,669
don't understand it is I don't
understand so for people don't know it

5904
02:03:45,669 --> 02:03:45,679
understand so for people don't know it
 

5905
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:48,910
understand so for people don't know it
it it um boy how would you even explain

5906
02:03:48,910 --> 02:03:48,920
it it um boy how would you even explain
 

5907
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:52,109
it it um boy how would you even explain
it it doesn't make any sense it's uh

5908
02:03:52,109 --> 02:03:52,119
it it doesn't make any sense it's uh
 

5909
02:03:52,119 --> 02:03:54,030
it it doesn't make any sense it's uh
when you just look

5910
02:03:54,030 --> 02:03:54,040
when you just look
 

5911
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:56,790
when you just look
solo the the movement you make is very

5912
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:56,800
solo the the movement you make is very
 

5913
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,870
solo the the movement you make is very
it's quite simple but uh how you get

5914
02:03:59,870 --> 02:03:59,880
it's quite simple but uh how you get
 

5915
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:02,510
it's quite simple but uh how you get
person to be off balance how you yeah uh

5916
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:02,520
person to be off balance how you yeah uh
 

5917
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:04,549
person to be off balance how you yeah uh
actually get them to be thrown and when

5918
02:04:04,549 --> 02:04:04,559
actually get them to be thrown and when
 

5919
02:04:04,559 --> 02:04:07,030
actually get them to be thrown and when
you do throw it successfully it looks

5920
02:04:07,030 --> 02:04:07,040
you do throw it successfully it looks
 

5921
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,910
you do throw it successfully it looks
like a whipping motion that's effortless

5922
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:09,920
like a whipping motion that's effortless
 

5923
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:12,310
like a whipping motion that's effortless
it makes no sense it makes no sense

5924
02:04:12,310 --> 02:04:12,320
it makes no sense it makes no sense
 

5925
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:15,149
it makes no sense it makes no sense
other than it's every technique starts

5926
02:04:15,149 --> 02:04:15,159
other than it's every technique starts
 

5927
02:04:15,159 --> 02:04:17,030
other than it's every technique starts
with the hands so it's what we call

5928
02:04:17,030 --> 02:04:17,040
with the hands so it's what we call
 

5929
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:18,549

you off balance with my hands and then
 

5945
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:37,189
you off balance with my hands and then
I'm going to just Flex my legs up just

5946
02:04:37,189 --> 02:04:37,199
I'm going to just Flex my legs up just
 

5947

as you're coming onto my back and uh and
 

5949
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,430
as you're coming onto my back and uh and
then you're going to go over you know if

5950
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:41,440
then you're going to go over you know if
 

5951
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:44,149
then you're going to go over you know if
I coordinate it all right if it uh if it

5952
02:04:44,149 --> 02:04:44,159
I coordinate it all right if it uh if it
 

5953
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:45,669
I coordinate it all right if it uh if it
doesn't get coordinated right then

5954
02:04:45,669 --> 02:04:45,679
doesn't get coordinated right then
 

5955
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:47,470
doesn't get coordinated right then
you're going to come right on my back

5956
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:47,480
you're going to come right on my back
 

5957
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:49,910
you're going to come right on my back
and try to rip my arm off you know so um

5958
02:04:49,910 --> 02:04:49,920
and try to rip my arm off you know so um
 

5959
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:51,830
and try to rip my arm off you know so um
yeah got to get it right what was the if

5960
02:04:51,830 --> 02:04:51,840
yeah got to get it right what was the if
 

5961
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,750
yeah got to get it right what was the if
you can put convert it toward

5962
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:53,760
you can put convert it toward
 

5963
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:57,510
you can put convert it toward
words uh some secret ingredients that

5964
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:57,520
words uh some secret ingredients that
 

5965
02:04:57,520 --> 02:04:58,830
words uh some secret ingredients that
allowed you to pull it off at the

5966
02:04:58,830 --> 02:04:58,840
allowed you to pull it off at the
 

5967
02:04:58,840 --> 02:05:03,189
allowed you to pull it off at the
highest levels the T the hands start

5968
02:05:03,189 --> 02:05:03,199
highest levels the T the hands start
 

5969
02:05:03,199 --> 02:05:06,189
highest levels the T the hands start
every technique uh so getting the

5970
02:05:06,189 --> 02:05:06,199
every technique uh so getting the
 

5971
02:05:06,199 --> 02:05:08,270
every technique uh so getting the
repetition right first of all so you

5972
02:05:08,270 --> 02:05:08,280
repetition right first of all so you
 

5973
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:09,990
repetition right first of all so you
need uh to get the repetition right you

5974
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:10,000
need uh to get the repetition right you
 

5975
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,430
need uh to get the repetition right you
need a good partner so uh actually

5976
02:05:12,430 --> 02:05:12,440
need a good partner so uh actually
 

5977
02:05:12,440 --> 02:05:14,870
need a good partner so uh actually
training your partner to react in the

5978
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:14,880
training your partner to react in the
 

5979
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,750
training your partner to react in the
right way is just as important as

5980
02:05:16,750 --> 02:05:16,760
right way is just as important as
 

5981
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:19,149
right way is just as important as
learning the throw so actually what

5982
02:05:19,149 --> 02:05:19,159
learning the throw so actually what
 

5983
02:05:19,159 --> 02:05:21,229
learning the throw so actually what
happens is you know I we could get a

5984
02:05:21,229 --> 02:05:21,239
happens is you know I we could get a
 

5985
02:05:21,239 --> 02:05:25,629
happens is you know I we could get a
lesson of beginners we teach the throw

5986
02:05:25,629 --> 02:05:25,639
lesson of beginners we teach the throw
 

5987
02:05:25,639 --> 02:05:28,870
lesson of beginners we teach the throw
and then go right off you go and 90% of

5988
02:05:28,870 --> 02:05:28,880
and then go right off you go and 90% of
 

5989
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,589
and then go right off you go and 90% of
them will get it wrong because their

5990
02:05:30,589 --> 02:05:30,599
them will get it wrong because their
 

5991
02:05:30,599 --> 02:05:32,549
them will get it wrong because their
partner's not reacting in the right way

5992
02:05:32,549 --> 02:05:32,559
partner's not reacting in the right way
 

5993
02:05:32,559 --> 02:05:35,069
partner's not reacting in the right way
so half of it is to get the person to

5994
02:05:35,069 --> 02:05:35,079
so half of it is to get the person to
 

5995
02:05:35,079 --> 02:05:38,030
so half of it is to get the person to
react as they should so if I was doing

5996
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:38,040
react as they should so if I was doing
 

5997
02:05:38,040 --> 02:05:40,990
react as they should so if I was doing
it with you you and I um first thing I'd

5998
02:05:40,990 --> 02:05:41,000
it with you you and I um first thing I'd
 

5999
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,549
it with you you and I um first thing I'd
teach you to do is to react the way I

6000
02:05:43,549 --> 02:05:43,559
teach you to do is to react the way I
 

6001
02:05:43,559 --> 02:05:45,870
teach you to do is to react the way I
want you to react and then I'd react the

6002
02:05:45,870 --> 02:05:45,880
want you to react and then I'd react the
 

6003
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:47,950
want you to react and then I'd react the
way that you want me to react all right

6004
02:05:47,950 --> 02:05:47,960
way that you want me to react all right
 

6005
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:50,310
way that you want me to react all right
so then we'd have success with it rather

6006
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:50,320
so then we'd have success with it rather
 

6007
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:53,189
so then we'd have success with it rather
than you leaning back in the wrong way

6008
02:05:53,189 --> 02:05:53,199
than you leaning back in the wrong way
 

6009
02:05:53,199 --> 02:05:56,109
than you leaning back in the wrong way
or resisting or frightened you going

6010
02:05:56,109 --> 02:05:56,119
or resisting or frightened you going
 

6011
02:05:56,119 --> 02:05:59,310
or resisting or frightened you going
over so you know so actually that's why

6012
02:05:59,310 --> 02:05:59,320
over so you know so actually that's why
 

6013
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:01,149
over so you know so actually that's why
nine times out of 10 people get the

6014
02:06:01,149 --> 02:06:01,159
nine times out of 10 people get the
 

6015
02:06:01,159 --> 02:06:02,669
nine times out of 10 people get the
technique wrong it's actually

6016
02:06:02,669 --> 02:06:02,679
technique wrong it's actually
 

6017
02:06:02,679 --> 02:06:04,229
technique wrong it's actually
fascinating to me because in the United

6018
02:06:04,229 --> 02:06:04,239
fascinating to me because in the United
 

6019
02:06:04,239 --> 02:06:06,870
fascinating to me because in the United
States where I came up Judo I mean the

6020
02:06:06,870 --> 02:06:06,880
States where I came up Judo I mean the
 

6021
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:09,069
States where I came up Judo I mean the
level of Judo is not comparable to the

6022
02:06:09,069 --> 02:06:09,079
level of Judo is not comparable to the
 

6023
02:06:09,079 --> 02:06:12,069
level of Judo is not comparable to the
level of Judo in the rest of the world

6024
02:06:12,069 --> 02:06:12,079
level of Judo in the rest of the world
 

6025
02:06:12,079 --> 02:06:14,950
level of Judo in the rest of the world
um of course uh the the Pedro Center is

6026
02:06:14,950 --> 02:06:14,960
um of course uh the the Pedro Center is
 

6027
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:17,069
um of course uh the the Pedro Center is
an exception to that so certain athletes

6028
02:06:17,069 --> 02:06:17,079
an exception to that so certain athletes
 

6029
02:06:17,079 --> 02:06:20,310
an exception to that so certain athletes
yeah certain athletes like I mean when I

6030
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:20,320
yeah certain athletes like I mean when I
 

6031
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,709
yeah certain athletes like I mean when I
trained recently with with Jimmy Pedro

6032
02:06:22,709 --> 02:06:22,719
trained recently with with Jimmy Pedro
 

6033
02:06:22,719 --> 02:06:25,470
trained recently with with Jimmy Pedro
it's like even like the 16-year-old kids

6034
02:06:25,470 --> 02:06:25,480
it's like even like the 16-year-old kids

of it felt right to be throwing them to

6054
02:06:53,189 --> 02:06:53,199
of it felt right to be throwing them to
 

6055
02:06:53,199 --> 02:06:54,830

6061
02:06:58,559 --> 02:07:01,750
hips about the shoulder everything it
was it was fun it was easy and like and

6062
02:07:01,750 --> 02:07:01,760
was it was fun it was easy and like and
 

6063
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,629
was it was fun it was easy and like and
I was felt like I was learning so I

6064
02:07:03,629 --> 02:07:03,639
I was felt like I was learning so I
 

6065
02:07:03,639 --> 02:07:06,629
I was felt like I was learning so I
think all of that is loaded in I guess

6066
02:07:06,629 --> 02:07:06,639
think all of that is loaded in I guess
 

6067
02:07:06,639 --> 02:07:08,629
think all of that is loaded in I guess
into proper training so you're

6068
02:07:08,629 --> 02:07:08,639
into proper training so you're
 

6069
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:10,109
into proper training so you're
developing through the throws you're

6070
02:07:10,109 --> 02:07:10,119
developing through the throws you're
 

6071
02:07:10,119 --> 02:07:11,870
developing through the throws you're
developing the right develop yeah and

6072
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:11,880
developing the right develop yeah and
 

6073
02:07:11,880 --> 02:07:14,270
developing the right develop yeah and
you have to develop um between you know

6074
02:07:14,270 --> 02:07:14,280
you have to develop um between you know
 

6075
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,709
you have to develop um between you know
I always had training partners that I

6076
02:07:15,709 --> 02:07:15,719
I always had training partners that I
 

6077
02:07:15,719 --> 02:07:18,870
I always had training partners that I
trained with up to each Olympic Games

6078
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:18,880

just purely for 60 rander a week how
much is each one how long is it so they

6302
02:12:01,470 --> 02:12:01,480
much is each one how long is it so they
 

6303
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:03,109
much is each one how long is it so they
were five minutes then they're four

6304
02:12:03,109 --> 02:12:03,119
were five minutes then they're four
 

6305
02:12:03,119 --> 02:12:05,109
were five minutes then they're four
minutes now but that's a lot especially

6306
02:12:05,109 --> 02:12:05,119
minutes now but that's a lot especially
 

6307
02:12:05,119 --> 02:12:07,390
minutes now but that's a lot especially
given the level of the the competition

6308

6319
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:20,589
moving at like a close to 100% but the
actual power in the force is not quite

6320
02:12:20,589 --> 02:12:20,599
actual power in the force is not quite
 

6321

randor so I Chas them into training

6332
02:12:38,229 --> 02:12:38,239
randor so I Chas them into training
 

6333
02:12:38,239 --> 02:12:40,149
randor so I Chas them into training
camps I trace them all over my country

6334
02:12:40,149 --> 02:12:40,159
camps I trace them all over my country
 

6335
02:12:40,159 --> 02:12:43,790
camps I trace them all over my country
so I I was getting 40 to 50 a week in my

6336
02:12:43,790 --> 02:12:43,800
so I I was getting 40 to 50 a week in my
 

6337

right so you'd go a yeah because you had

6386
02:13:44,270 --> 02:13:44,280
right so you'd go a yeah because you had
 

6387
02:13:44,280 --> 02:13:46,830
right so you'd go a yeah because you had
