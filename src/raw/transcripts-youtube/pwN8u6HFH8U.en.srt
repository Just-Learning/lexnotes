sequence and then and then it gets
 

137
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,470

digested again and recycled back and
 

139
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,190

it's uh it's difficult to describe in
 

1041
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,750
it's uh it's difficult to describe in
words there's a lot of power and we're

1042
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:04,760
words there's a lot of power and we're
 

1043
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,909
words there's a lot of power and we're
talking about the power of the neck like

talking about the power of the neck like
 

1045
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:08,710
talking about the power of the neck like
the what is it I mean there's a lot it

the what is it I mean there's a lot it
 

1047
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,350
the what is it I mean there's a lot it
can generate power all up and down the

1048
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:10,360
can generate power all up and down the
 

1049
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,789
can generate power all up and down the
body so probably the tail is a monster

1050
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
body so probably the tail is a monster
 

1051
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,270
body so probably the tail is a monster
mhm but just just the neck and you know

1052
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:16,280
mhm but just just the neck and you know
 

1053
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,149
mhm but just just the neck and you know
not not to mention the the power of the

1054
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:18,159
not not to mention the the power of the
 

1055
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,990
not not to mention the the power of the
bite that and the speed too because uh

1056
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
bite that and the speed too because uh
 

1057
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,549
bite that and the speed too because uh
the thing I saw and got to experience is

1058
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
the thing I saw and got to experience is
 

1059
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,990
the thing I saw and got to experience is
how still and calm at least from my

1060
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:27,000
how still and calm at least from my
 

1061
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,390
how still and calm at least from my
amateur perspective it seems

1062
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
amateur perspective it seems
 

1063
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,789
amateur perspective it seems
calm uh still and then from that sort of

1064
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:33,799
calm uh still and then from that sort of
 

1065
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,990
calm uh still and then from that sort of
0 to 60 could just just go wi it's

1066
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
0 to 60 could just just go wi it's
 

1067
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,909
0 to 60 could just just go wi it's
thrashing and then there's also a

1068
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
thrashing and then there's also a
 

1069
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,190
thrashing and then there's also a
decision it makes in that Split Second

1070
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,200
decision it makes in that Split Second
 

1071
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,149
decision it makes in that Split Second
whether uh as it thrashes is it going to

1072
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:45,159
whether uh as it thrashes is it going to
 

1073
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,310
whether uh as it thrashes is it going to
kind of bite you on the way or not M and

1074
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:49,320
kind of bite you on the way or not M and
 

1075
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,110
kind of bite you on the way or not M and
that's where that's where of the four

1076
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,120
that's where that's where of the four
 

1077
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,750
that's where that's where of the four
species of Cayman that we have here you

1078
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:53,760
species of Cayman that we have here you
 

1079
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,390
species of Cayman that we have here you
see differences in their personalities

1080
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:55,400
see differences in their personalities
 

1081
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,669
see differences in their personalities
as a species and so you can like just

1082
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
as a species and so you can like just
 

1083
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,190
as a species and so you can like just
like you know like gener

1084

and the only way to see which Cayman
 

1187
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,190
and the only way to see which Cayman
you're dealing with is to catch it

1188
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
you're dealing with is to catch it
 

1189
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,230
you're dealing with is to catch it
because a lot of times you get up close

because a lot of times you get up close

haven't seen that in decades so it's
 

1203
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,950
haven't seen that in decades so it's
important that we monitor our Croc

and I jumped on a spectacle came that

1222
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:28,840
and I jumped on a spectacle came that
 

1223
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,950
and I jumped on a spectacle came that
was slightly longer than I am and I'm

1225
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,990
was slightly longer than I am and I'm
5'9 so I I jumped on this probably 6ot

1226
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
5'9 so I I jumped on this probably 6ot
 

1227

too far don't leave the three of us

1442
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:28,600
too far don't leave the three of us
 

1443
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,789
too far don't leave the three of us
right now yeah were too far out to take

1444
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:30,799
right now yeah were too far out to take
 

1445
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,669
right now yeah were too far out to take
risks we're too far out to be walking

1446
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:32,679
risks we're too far out to be walking
 

1447
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,669
risks we're too far out to be walking
along the riverbed at night because then

smooth fronted Cay and dwarf Cayman
spectacle Cayman they're not going to

1556
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:29,799
spectacle Cayman they're not going to

1559
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,750

were doing something inappropriate with

1560
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:34,760
were doing something inappropriate with
 

1561
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,029
were doing something inappropriate with
a Cayman like you jumped on it and were

1562
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
a Cayman like you jumped on it and were
 

1563
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,110
a Cayman like you jumped on it and were
trying to to do research and and it bit

1564
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
trying to to do research and and it bit
 

1565
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,110
trying to to do research and and it bit
your hand it could take your hand off

1566
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,120
your hand it could take your hand off
 

1567
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,630
your hand it could take your hand off
but that's the only time I've been

1568
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640
but that's the only time I've been
 

1569
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,310
but that's the only time I've been
walking down the river and stepped on a

1570
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:44,320
walking down the river and stepped on a
 

1571
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,389
walking down the river and stepped on a
Cayman and the Cayman just swims away

1572
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:46,399
Cayman and the Cayman just swims away
 

1573
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,789
Cayman and the Cayman just swims away
and so in my mind Cayman are just these

1574
00:28:48,789 --> 00:28:48,799
and so in my mind Cayman are just these
 

1575
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,669
and so in my mind Cayman are just these
they're peaceful dragons that sit on the

1576
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:50,679
they're peaceful dragons that sit on the
 

1577
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,230
they're peaceful dragons that sit on the
side of the river and so to me they are

1578
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
side of the river and so to me they are
 

1579
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,549
side of the river and so to me they are
my friends and I worry about them

1580
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:54,559
my friends and I worry about them
 

1581
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,830
my friends and I worry about them
because two months ago we were coming up

1582
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:56,840
because two months ago we were coming up
 

1583
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,430
because two months ago we were coming up
River and on one of the beaches was a

1584
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:00,440
River and on one of the beaches was a
 

1585
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,110
River and on one of the beaches was a
beautiful about 5 foot black cayman with

1586
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120
beautiful about 5 foot black cayman with
 

1587
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,950
beautiful about 5 foot black cayman with
a big machete cut right through the head

1588
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:05,960
a big machete cut right through the head
 

1589
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,630
a big machete cut right through the head
the whole Cayman was wasted nothing was

1590
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
the whole Cayman was wasted nothing was
 

1591
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,630
the whole Cayman was wasted nothing was
eaten but the Cayman was dead what do

1592
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:11,640
eaten but the Cayman was dead what do
 

1593
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,350
eaten but the Cayman was dead what do
you think that was curious humans just

1594
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
you think that was curious humans just
 

1595
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,389
you think that was curious humans just
committing

1596
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:16,399
committing
 

1597
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,870
committing
violence yeah just loggers people who

1598
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:18,880
violence yeah just loggers people who
 

1599
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,230
violence yeah just loggers people who
aren't from this part of the Amazon

1600
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
aren't from this part of the Amazon
 

1601
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,830
aren't from this part of the Amazon
because a local person would either eat

1602
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:22,840
because a local person would either eat
 

1603
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,149
because a local person would either eat
the animal or not mess with it like pico

1604
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,159
the animal or not mess with it like pico
 

1605
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,789
the animal or not mess with it like pico
would never kill a Cayman for no reason

1606
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:27,799
would never kill a Cayman for no reason
 

1607
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,470
would never kill a Cayman for no reason
because it doesn't make any sense so

1608
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
because it doesn't make any sense so
 

1609
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,230
because it doesn't make any sense so
these are clearly people who aren't from

1610
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240
these are clearly people who aren't from
 

1611
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,870
these are clearly people who aren't from
the region which usually means loggers

1612
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:33,880
the region which usually means loggers
 

1613
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,430
the region which usually means loggers
because they've come from somewhere else

1614
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,440
because they've come from somewhere else
 

1615
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,190
because they've come from somewhere else
they're doing a job here and they

1616
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
they're doing a job here and they
 

1617
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,430
they're doing a job here and they
they're just cleaning their pots in the

1618
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:38,440
they're just cleaning their pots in the
 

1619
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,909
they're just cleaning their pots in the
river at night and they see eyes come

1620
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:39,919
river at night and they see eyes come
 

1621
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,230
river at night and they see eyes come
near them because the Cayman probably

1622
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:41,240
near them because the Cayman probably
 

1623
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,710
near them because the Cayman probably
smells fish and then they just whack cuz

1624
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:43,720
smells fish and then they just whack cuz
 

1625
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,990
smells fish and then they just whack cuz
they want to see it and they're just

1626
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,000
they want to see it and they're just
 

1627
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,909
they want to see it and they're just

1709
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,750
emotionally physically there's a lot of
ways to die in the stupidest of ways we

1710
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,760
ways to die in the stupidest of ways we
 

1711
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,029
ways to die in the stupidest of ways we
went on a Expedition through the forest

1712
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,039
went on a Expedition through the forest
 

1713
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,950
went on a Expedition through the forest
just twisting your ankle breaking your

1714
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
just twisting your ankle breaking your
 

1715
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,110
just twisting your ankle breaking your
foot um getting a bite from a thing that

1716
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,120
foot um getting a bite from a thing that
 

1717
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,190
foot um getting a bite from a thing that
gets infected it's there's a lot of ways

1718
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:30,200
gets infected it's there's a lot of ways
 

1719
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,190
gets infected it's there's a lot of ways
to die and get hurt in the stupidest

1720
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,200
to die and get hurt in the stupidest
 

1721
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,310
to die and get hurt in the stupidest
ways in a non-dramatic Cayman eating you

1722
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:36,320
ways in a non-dramatic Cayman eating you
 

1723
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,110
ways in a non-dramatic Cayman eating you
alive kind of way yeah it it it strikes

1724
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
alive kind of way yeah it it it strikes
 

1725
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,350
alive kind of way yeah it it it strikes
me as unfair because humans we still in

1726
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,360
me as unfair because humans we still in
 

1727
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,310
me as unfair because humans we still in
our minds so so programmed to worry

1728
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,320
our minds so so programmed to worry
 

1729
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,230
our minds so so programmed to worry
about that Predator that Predator that

1730
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
about that Predator that Predator that
 

1731
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,629
about that Predator that Predator that
Predator what predator we've killed

1732
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:49,639
Predator what predator we've killed
 

1733
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:51,070
Predator what predator we've killed
everything black Caymans are coming off

1734
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:51,080
everything black Caymans are coming off
 

1735
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,830
everything black Caymans are coming off
the endangered species list we

1736
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:52,840
the endangered species list we
 

1737
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,549
the endangered species list we
exterminated wolves from North America I

1738
00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:54,559
exterminated wolves from North America I
 

1739
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,950
exterminated wolves from North America I
actually heard a Suburban lady one time

1740
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
actually heard a Suburban lady one time
 

1741
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,430
actually heard a Suburban lady one time
tell her son watch out foxes will get

1742
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
tell her son watch out foxes will get
 

1743
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,789
tell her son watch out foxes will get
you mhm foxes yeah they eat baby rabbits

1744
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:03,799
you mhm foxes yeah they eat baby rabbits
 

1745
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,110
you mhm foxes yeah they eat baby rabbits
and mice well in the case of apex

1746
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,120
and mice well in the case of apex
 

1747
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,950
and mice well in the case of apex
predators I think when people say

1748
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:07,960
predators I think when people say
 

1749
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,470
predators I think when people say
dangerous

1750
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:09,480
dangerous
 

1751
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,950
dangerous
animals they really are talking about

1752
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:11,960
animals they really are talking about
 

1753
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,350
animals they really are talking about
just the power of the

1754
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,360
just the power of the
 

1755
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,149
just the power of the
animal and the black came have a lot of

1756
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:16,159
animal and the black came have a lot of
 

1757
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,110
animal and the black came have a lot of
power lot of power and it's almost just

1758
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,120
power lot of power and it's almost just
 

1759
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,830
power lot of power and it's almost just
a way to celebrate the power of the

1760
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:20,840
a way to celebrate the power of the
 

1761
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,629
a way to celebrate the power of the
animal sure and if it's in celebration

1762
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:22,639
animal sure and if it's in celebration
 

1763
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:24,549
animal sure and if it's in celebration
then I'm all for it because my God is

1764
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:24,559
then I'm all for it because my God is
 

1765
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,190
then I'm all for it because my God is
that power like the waves of of of fear

1766
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,200
that power like the waves of of of fear
 

1767
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,629
that power like the waves of of of fear
that you saw like when that tail I mean

1768
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:29,639
that you saw like when that tail I mean
 

1769
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:30,669
that you saw like when that tail I mean
you saw you saw the tail of the

1770
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:30,679
you saw you saw the tail of the
 

1771
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:32,750
you saw you saw the tail of the
spectacle that perfect amazing thing

1772
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:32,760
spectacle that perfect amazing thing
 

1773
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,430
spectacle that perfect amazing thing
with all those interlocking scales that

1774
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:34,440
with all those interlocking scales that
 

1775
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,070
with all those interlocking scales that
work so it's like a perfect creation of

1776
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,080
work so it's like a perfect creation of
 

1777
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,590
work so it's like a perfect creation of
engineering and then and then when you

1778
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:38,600
engineering and then and then when you
 

1779
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,909
engineering and then and then when you
have one that's this thick and all of a

1780
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:40,919
have one that's this thick and all of a
 

1781
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,470
have one that's this thick and all of a
sudden that thing is moving with all the

1782
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
sudden that thing is moving with all the
 

1783
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,389
sudden that thing is moving with all the
acceleration of that power W the volume

1784
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:46,399
acceleration of that power W the volume
 

1785
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,389
acceleration of that power W the volume
of water the sound that comes out of

1786
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:48,399
of water the sound that comes out of
 

1787
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,629
of water the sound that comes out of
their throat they're such they're

1788
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:50,639
their throat they're such they're
 

1789
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:52,669
their throat they're such they're
dragons we talked about the scales of

1790
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:52,679
dragons we talked about the scales of
 

1791
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,029
dragons we talked about the scales of
the snake but like they came in just the

1792
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:55,039
the snake but like they came in just the
 

1793
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,909
the snake but like they came in just the
way it felt yeah was uh incredible just

1794
00:32:58,909 --> 00:32:58,919
way it felt yeah was uh incredible just
 

1795
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,149
way it felt yeah was uh incredible just
the armor the texture of it was so cool

1796
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:02,159
the armor the texture of it was so cool
 

1797
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,870
the armor the texture of it was so cool
I don't know like the the the bottom one

1798
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:03,880
I don't know like the the the bottom one
 

1799
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,950
I don't know like the the the bottom one
came in have a certain kind of texture

1800
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:05,960
came in have a certain kind of texture
 

1801
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,950
came in have a certain kind of texture
and it just all feels like power but

1802
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:07,960
and it just all feels like power but
 

1803
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,590
and it just all feels like power but
also all feels like designed really well

1804
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:10,600
also all feels like designed really well
 

1805
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,830
also all feels like designed really well
it's like it's like

1806
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:12,840
it's like it's like
 

1807
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,470
it's like it's like
exploring through touch like a World War

1808
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:15,480
exploring through touch like a World War
 

1809
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,870
exploring through touch like a World War
II tank or something like that just it's

1810
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:17,880
II tank or something like that just it's
 

1811
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,310
II tank or something like that just it's
the engineering that went into this

1812
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:19,320
the engineering that went into this
 

1813
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,070
the engineering that went into this
thing yeah that like the mechanism of

1814
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,080
thing yeah that like the mechanism of
 

1815
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,350
thing yeah that like the mechanism of
evolution that created a thing that

1816
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:24,360
evolution that created a thing that
 

1817
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,269
evolution that created a thing that
could survive for such a long time it's

1818
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:27,279
could survive for such a long time it's
 

1819
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,950
could survive for such a long time it's
just like incredible this is a work of

1820
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:29,960
just like incredible this is a work of
 

1821
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,509
just like incredible this is a work of
art the PO you know the defense

1822
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:32,519
art the PO you know the defense
 

1823
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,789
art the PO you know the defense
mechanisms the power of it the damage it

1824
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
mechanisms the power of it the damage it
 

1825
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,870
mechanisms the power of it the damage it
can do uh how effective it is as a

1826
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:37,880
can do uh how effective it is as a
 

1827
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,830
can do uh how effective it is as a
hunter all of that all you could feel

1828
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:39,840
hunter all of that all you could feel
 

1829
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,909
hunter all of that all you could feel
that in just by touching it do you ever

1830
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:42,919
that in just by touching it do you ever
 

1831
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:45,070
that in just by touching it do you ever
see the the mashup where they put side

1832
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:45,080
see the the mashup where they put side
 

1833
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,350
see the the mashup where they put side
by side the image of I think it's a

1834
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,360
by side the image of I think it's a
 

1835
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,509
by side the image of I think it's a
falcon in Flight next to a stealth

1836
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:49,519
falcon in Flight next to a stealth
 

1837
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,750
falcon in Flight next to a stealth
bomber and they're almost the exact same

1838
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:51,760
bomber and they're almost the exact same
 

1839
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,509
bomber and they're almost the exact same
design it's incredible like that what's

1840
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:54,519
design it's incredible like that what's
 

1841
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,870
design it's incredible like that what's
the equivalent for for a Croc

1842
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:57,880
the equivalent for for a Croc
 

1843
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,470
the equivalent for for a Croc
maybe a tank like more like armadillo

1844
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,480
maybe a tank like more like armadillo
 

1845
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,830
maybe a tank like more like armadillo
Turtle I don't know like H and yeah

1846
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:02,840
Turtle I don't know like H and yeah
 

1847
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,230
Turtle I don't know like H and yeah
there may not be a a machine a war

1848
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,240
there may not be a a machine a war
 

1849
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,029
there may not be a a machine a war
machine equivalent of a crocodile it

1850
00:34:07,029 --> 00:34:07,039
machine equivalent of a crocodile it
 

1851
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,550
machine equivalent of a crocodile it
would have to have like

1852
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:08,560
would have to have like
 

1853
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,629
would have to have like
a big jaw element to it yeah the water I

1854
00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:11,639
a big jaw element to it yeah the water I
 

1855
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,349
a big jaw element to it yeah the water I
mean we we talked also about hippos

1856
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:14,359
mean we we talked also about hippos
 

1857
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:15,790
mean we we talked also about hippos
those are interesting creatures from all

1858
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:15,800
those are interesting creatures from all
 

1859
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,430
those are interesting creatures from all
the way across the world just monsters

1860
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:18,440
the way across the world just monsters
 

1861
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,589
the way across the world just monsters
yeah hippos and rhinos hippos are bigger

Cayman occupy the exact same Niche M and

2054
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,200
Cayman occupy the exact same Niche M and
 

2055
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,910
Cayman occupy the exact same Niche M and
they're born at almost the exact same

2056

they're born at almost the exact same
 

2057
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,470
they're born at almost the exact same
size and unlike most species they don't

2058
00:37:59,470 --> 00:37:59,480
size and unlike most species they don't
 

2059
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,109
size and unlike most species they don't
have sort of a size range that they're

have sort of a size range that they're
 

2061
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,150
have sort of a size range that they're
confined to they start at this big baby

2062
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,160
confined to they start at this big baby
 

2063
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,190

Cayman are this big baby anacondas are a

2064
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,200
Cayman are this big baby anacondas are a
 

2065
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,750
Cayman are this big baby anacondas are a
little longer but they're they're

2066
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:07,760
little longer but they're they're
 

2067
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,069
little longer but they're they're
thinner and they don't have legs so it's

2068
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:09,079
thinner and they don't have legs so it's
 

2069
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:12,790
thinner and they don't have legs so it's
the same thing in in terms of mass and

2070
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:12,800
the same thing in in terms of mass and
 

2071
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,230
the same thing in in terms of mass and
they're all in the streams or at the

2073
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,030
they're all in the streams or at the
edges of lakes or swamps and so the baby

2074
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,040
edges of lakes or swamps and so the baby
 

2075
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,950

followed him for a long time and I was
like cool and then I was trying to gauge

2166
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:52,760
like cool and then I was trying to gauge
 

2167
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,270
like cool and then I was trying to gauge
like can I drink this stream and I see

2168
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
like can I drink this stream and I see
 

2169
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,910
like can I drink this stream and I see
aula and aula is a salt deposit where

2170
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:57,920
aula and aula is a salt deposit where
 

2171
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,069
aula and aula is a salt deposit where
animals come to to feed cuz sodium is is

2172
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:01,079
animals come to to feed cuz sodium is is
 

2173
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:02,670
animals come to to feed cuz sodium is is
is a deficiency that most herbivores

2174
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:02,680
is a deficiency that most herbivores
 

2175
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,309
is a deficiency that most herbivores
have here and all of a sudden I just

2176
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:05,319
have here and all of a sudden I just
 

2177
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:07,790
have here and all of a sudden I just
hear like the sound of a wet stick

2178
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:07,800
hear like the sound of a wet stick
 

2179
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,510
hear like the sound of a wet stick
snapping just that bone

2180
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:10,520
snapping just that bone
 

2181
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,790
snapping just that bone
Crunch and I look down and there's about

2182
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:12,800
Crunch and I look down and there's about
 

2183
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,950
Crunch and I look down and there's about
a 16 foot anaconda wrapped around a

2184
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:15,960
a 16 foot anaconda wrapped around a
 

2185
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,190
a 16 foot anaconda wrapped around a
freshly killed pecky wild boore and what

2186
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:20,200
freshly killed pecky wild boore and what
 

2187
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,670
freshly killed pecky wild boore and what
this Anaconda had done was as the all

2188
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:22,680
this Anaconda had done was as the all
 

2189
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,990
this Anaconda had done was as the all
the pigs were going across the stream

2190
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:25,000
the pigs were going across the stream
 

2191
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,670
the pigs were going across the stream
the Anaconda had grabbed it by the the

2192
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:27,680
the Anaconda had grabbed it by the the
 

2193
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,750
the Anaconda had grabbed it by the the
jaw swiped the legs wrapped around it

2194
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:31,760
jaw swiped the legs wrapped around it
 

2195
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,750
jaw swiped the legs wrapped around it
bent it in half and then crushed Its

2196
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:34,760
bent it in half and then crushed Its
 

2197
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,270
bent it in half and then crushed Its
Ribs and that's what the Anaconda do

2198
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,280
Ribs and that's what the Anaconda do
 

2199
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,910
Ribs and that's what the Anaconda do
whether it's to mammals to Cayman it's

2200
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:38,920
whether it's to mammals to Cayman it's
 

2201
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,309
whether it's to mammals to Cayman it's
all the same thing it's grab on they

2202
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:41,319
all the same thing it's grab on they
 

2203
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,710
all the same thing it's grab on they
have six rows of backwards facing teeth

2204
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:44,720
have six rows of backwards facing teeth
 

2205
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,790
have six rows of backwards facing teeth
so once they hit you they're never going

2206
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:46,800
so once they hit you they're never going
 

2207
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,390
so once they hit you they're never going
to come off you actually have to go

2208
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:48,400
to come off you actually have to go
 

2209
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,230
to come off you actually have to go
deeper in and then open before you can

2210
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,240
deeper in and then open before you can
 

2211
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,270
deeper in and then open before you can
come out all those backward facing teeth

2212
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:52,280
come out all those backward facing teeth
 

2213
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,990
come out all those backward facing teeth
so they have an incredible anchor system

2214
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,000
so they have an incredible anchor system
 

2215
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,309
so they have an incredible anchor system
and then they use their weight to pull

2216
00:40:56,309 --> 00:40:56,319
and then they use their weight to pull
 

2217
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,309
and then they use their weight to pull
you down to Hell to pull you down into

2218
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:58,319
you down to Hell to pull you down into
 

2219
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,910
you down to Hell to pull you down into
that water wrap around you and then

2220
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:00,920
that water wrap around you and then
 

2221
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,870
that water wrap around you and then
start breaking you and Every Breath You

2222
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:02,880
start breaking you and Every Breath You
 

2223
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,109
start breaking you and Every Breath You
Take you go and you you're up against a

2224
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:06,119
Take you go and you you're up against a
 

2225
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,950
Take you go and you you're up against a
barrier and then when you when you

2226
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:07,960
barrier and then when you when you
 

2227
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,790
barrier and then when you when you
exhale they go a little tighter and

2228
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:09,800
exhale they go a little tighter and
 

2229
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,069
exhale they go a little tighter and
you're never going to get that space

2230
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:11,079
you're never going to get that space
 

2231
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,710
you're never going to get that space
back your lungs are never going to

2232
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:12,720
back your lungs are never going to
 

2233
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,990
back your lungs are never going to
expand again and I know this because

2234
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:15,000
expand again and I know this because
 

2235
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,470
expand again and I know this because
I've been in that Crush before JJ pulled

2236
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:17,480
I've been in that Crush before JJ pulled
 

2237
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,349
I've been in that Crush before JJ pulled
me out of it and so this pig the

2238
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:19,359
me out of it and so this pig the
 

2239
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,829
me out of it and so this pig the
Anaconda had gotten it and as the pig

2240
00:41:20,829 --> 00:41:20,839
Anaconda had gotten it and as the pig
 

2241
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:22,069
Anaconda had gotten it and as the pig
was thrashing and the Anaconda was

2242
00:41:22,069 --> 00:41:22,079
was thrashing and the Anaconda was
 

2243
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,630
was thrashing and the Anaconda was
wrapping around had bent it in half and

2244
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:24,640
wrapping around had bent it in half and
 

2245
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,550
wrapping around had bent it in half and
I just heard those vertebrae going yeah

2246
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:26,560
I just heard those vertebrae going yeah
 

2247
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,069
I just heard those vertebrae going yeah
and so for it's the same thing they just

2248
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:28,079
and so for it's the same thing they just
 

2249
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,349
and so for it's the same thing they just
grab and they wrap around it and then

2250
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
grab and they wrap around it and then
 

2251
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,349
grab and they wrap around it and then
they have to crush it until there's no

2252
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:31,359
they have to crush it until there's no
 

2253
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,030
they have to crush it until there's no
response they'll wait an hour they'll

2254
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,040
response they'll wait an hour they'll
 

2255
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,550
response they'll wait an hour they'll
wait a long time until there's no

2256
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560
wait a long time until there's no
 

2257
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,829
wait a long time until there's no
response from the animal they'll

2258
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:35,839
response from the animal they'll
 

2259
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,270
response from the animal they'll
overpower it then they'll then they'll

2260
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:38,280
overpower it then they'll then they'll
 

2261
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,069
overpower it then they'll then they'll
reposition probably yawn a little bit

2262
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:41,079
reposition probably yawn a little bit
 

2263
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:44,430
reposition probably yawn a little bit
open their jaw and then start forcing

2264
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:44,440
open their jaw and then start forcing
 

2265
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,589
open their jaw and then start forcing
that entire now here's the crazy thing

2266
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:47,599
that entire now here's the crazy thing
 

2267
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,910
that entire now here's the crazy thing
is that an anaconda has stomach acid

2268
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:49,920
is that an anaconda has stomach acid
 

2269
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,109
is that an anaconda has stomach acid
capable of digesting an entire crocodile

2270
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:54,119
capable of digesting an entire crocodile
 

2271
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,390
capable of digesting an entire crocodile
where nothing comes out the other side

2272
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
where nothing comes out the other side
 

2273
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,270
where nothing comes out the other side
and when you see how thick the Bony

2274
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:58,280
and when you see how thick the Bony
 

2275
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,230
and when you see how thick the Bony
plate of a crocodile skull is that that

2276
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:01,240
plate of a crocodile skull is that that
 

2277
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,950
plate of a crocodile skull is that that
can go in the mouth and nothing comes

2278
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:02,960
can go in the mouth and nothing comes
 

2279
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,630
can go in the mouth and nothing comes
out the other side that's insane and so

2280
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:04,640
out the other side that's insane and so
 

2281
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,390
out the other side that's insane and so
it always made me wonder on a chemistry

2282
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
it always made me wonder on a chemistry
 

2283
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,750
it always made me wonder on a chemistry
level how you can have such incredible

2284
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:08,760
level how you can have such incredible
 

2285
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,470
level how you can have such incredible
acid in the stomach that doesn't harm

2286
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
acid in the stomach that doesn't harm
 

2287
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,470
acid in the stomach that doesn't harm
the Anaconda

2288
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
the Anaconda
 

2289
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,829
the Anaconda
itself and someone said but it's able to

2290
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:14,839
itself and someone said but it's able to
 

2291
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,069
itself and someone said but it's able to
digest oh it's some kind of mucus oh the

2292
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:17,079
digest oh it's some kind of mucus oh the
 

2293
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:19,349
digest oh it's some kind of mucus oh the
MU mu there's oh interesting there's

2294
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359
MU mu there's oh interesting there's
 

2295
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,910
MU mu there's oh interesting there's
levels of protection from the Anaconda

2296
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:20,920
levels of protection from the Anaconda
 

2297
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,710
levels of protection from the Anaconda
itself but it seems like the anacon is

2298
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
itself but it seems like the anacon is
 

2299
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,430
itself but it seems like the anacon is
such a simple system as an organism know

2300
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:26,440
such a simple system as an organism know
 

2301
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,589
such a simple system as an organism know
like that simpl taking a scale could

2302
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:28,599
like that simpl taking a scale could
 

2303
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,190
like that simpl taking a scale could
just do the can swallow a Cayman and

2304
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:32,200
just do the can swallow a Cayman and
 

2305
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,349
just do the can swallow a Cayman and
digest it slowly I know but my question

2306
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:34,359
digest it slowly I know but my question
 

2307
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:36,910
digest it slowly I know but my question
was how how on Earth is it physically

2308
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:36,920
was how how on Earth is it physically
 

2309
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,349
was how how on Earth is it physically
possible to have this hellish bile that

2310
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:39,359
possible to have this hellish bile that
 

2311
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,510
possible to have this hellish bile that
can digest anything even something as as

2312
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:42,520
can digest anything even something as as
 

2313
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,030
can digest anything even something as as
as horrendous as a as a a c in scales

2314
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,040
as horrendous as a as a a c in scales
 

2315
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,150
as horrendous as a as a a c in scales
and bones and all the hardest shit in

2316
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,160
and bones and all the hardest shit in
 

2317
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,870
and bones and all the hardest shit in

00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:47,640
lot of scientific work on on on the
 

2625
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,870
lot of scientific work on on on the
topic so like really in everything

2626
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:49,880
topic so like really in everything
 

2627
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,069
topic so like really in everything
you've been doing

2628
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:51,079
you've been doing
 

2629
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:54,470
you've been doing
here you are celebrating the animals

2630
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:54,480
here you are celebrating the animals
 

2631
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,750
here you are celebrating the animals
you're respecting the animals you're

2632
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:56,760
you're respecting the animals you're
 

2633
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,589
you're respecting the animals you're
protecting the animals but you're also

2634
00:48:59,589 --> 00:48:59,599
protecting the animals but you're also
 

2635
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,390
protecting the animals but you're also
excited about studying the animals in

2636
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:01,400
excited about studying the animals in
 

2637
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,230
excited about studying the animals in
their environment So you you're actually

2638
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,240
their environment So you you're actually
 

2639
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:06,309
their environment So you you're actually
a co-author on on a paper uh on a couple

2640
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:06,319
a co-author on on a paper uh on a couple
 

2641
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,630
a co-author on on a paper uh on a couple
of papers but one of them is on

2642
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:07,640
of papers but one of them is on
 

2643
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,829
of papers but one of them is on
anacondas and uh studying green anaconda

2644
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:10,839
anacondas and uh studying green anaconda
 

2645
00:49:10,839 --> 00:49:15,030
anacondas and uh studying green anaconda
hunting patterns what's that about so um

2646
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:15,040
hunting patterns what's that about so um
 

2647
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,030
hunting patterns what's that about so um
the lead authors of that paper Pat

2648
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:17,040
the lead authors of that paper Pat
 

2649
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,829
the lead authors of that paper Pat
champagne and Carter Payne uh friends of

2650
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:19,839
champagne and Carter Payne uh friends of
 

2651
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:23,789
champagne and Carter Payne uh friends of
mine and what we started noticing for me

2652
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:23,799
mine and what we started noticing for me
 

2653
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:25,470
mine and what we started noticing for me
began at that story I told you where we

2654
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:25,480
began at that story I told you where we
 

2655
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,150
began at that story I told you where we
were coming across the Stream and we saw

2656
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:27,160
were coming across the Stream and we saw
 

2657
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:32,030
were coming across the Stream and we saw
the Anaconda had had had been positioned

2658
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:32,040
the Anaconda had had had been positioned
 

2659
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,870
the Anaconda had had had been positioned
just below

2660
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:33,880
just below
 

2661
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,190
just below
aopa and then other people began

2662
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:36,200
aopa and then other people began
 

2663
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,390
aopa and then other people began
noticing that Anaconda seemed to always

2664
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:38,400
noticing that Anaconda seemed to always
 

2665
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,510
noticing that Anaconda seemed to always
be beneath these culpas where mammals

2666
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:40,520
be beneath these culpas where mammals
 

2667
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,270
be beneath these culpas where mammals
were going to be coming and that that

2668
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:42,280
were going to be coming and that that
 

2669
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,990
were going to be coming and that that
contrasted with what we knew about

2670
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
contrasted with what we knew about
 

2671
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,710
contrasted with what we knew about
anacondas because what we understood

2672
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:45,720
anacondas because what we understood
 

2673
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,030
anacondas because what we understood
about anacondas that they're purely

2674
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,040
about anacondas that they're purely
 

2675
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,270
about anacondas that they're purely
Ambush predators and they don't pursue

2676
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
Ambush predators and they don't pursue
 

2677
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,549
Ambush predators and they don't pursue
their prey but what we began finding out

2678
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:52,559
their prey but what we began finding out
 

2679
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,870
their prey but what we began finding out
here and Pat led the process of amazing

2680
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:56,880
here and Pat led the process of amazing
 

2681
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,270
here and Pat led the process of amazing
scientist he worked with the KD

2682
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:58,280
scientist he worked with the KD
 

2683
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,829
scientist he worked with the KD
University for a long time worked with

2684
00:49:59,829 --> 00:49:59,839
University for a long time worked with
 

2685
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,870
University for a long time worked with
us for a long time and and he he was one

2686
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:03,880
us for a long time and and he he was one
 

2687
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,750
us for a long time and and he he was one
of the first to put a transmitter in an

2688
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:06,760
of the first to put a transmitter in an
 

2689
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,630
of the first to put a transmitter in an
anaconda right around here and we were

2690
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
anaconda right around here and we were
 

2691
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,230
anaconda right around here and we were
able to see their movements and that's

2692
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:10,240
able to see their movements and that's
 

2693
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,549
able to see their movements and that's
what these papers are showing is that

2694
00:50:11,549 --> 00:50:11,559
what these papers are showing is that
 

2695
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:14,349
what these papers are showing is that
they actually do pursue their prey they

2696
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:14,359
they actually do pursue their prey they
 

2697
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:16,710
they actually do pursue their prey they
do move up and down using the streams as

2698
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:16,720
do move up and down using the streams as
 

2699
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,309
do move up and down using the streams as
corridors through the forest they

2700
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:18,319
corridors through the forest they
 

2701
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,589
corridors through the forest they
actually do pursue their prey they

2702
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
actually do pursue their prey they
 

2703
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,030
actually do pursue their prey they
actually do seek out food so I mean

2704
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:22,040
actually do seek out food so I mean
 

2705
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,470
actually do seek out food so I mean
think about it it's a it's a giant

2706
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:23,480
think about it it's a it's a giant
 

2707
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,309
think about it it's a it's a giant
anaconda obviously it's not it can't

2708
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:25,319
anaconda obviously it's not it can't
 

2709
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:27,390
anaconda obviously it's not it can't
just sit in one spot it has to put some

2710
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:27,400
just sit in one spot it has to put some
 

2711
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,349
just sit in one spot it has to put some
work into it and so they're using scent

2712
00:50:29,349 --> 00:50:29,359
work into it and so they're using scent
 

2713
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,069
work into it and so they're using scent
and they're using communication to use

2714
00:50:32,069 --> 00:50:32,079
and they're using communication to use
 

2715
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:33,589
and they're using communication to use
the streams so you could be walking in

2716
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:33,599
the streams so you could be walking in
 

2717
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,789
the streams so you could be walking in
the forest in a very shallow stream and

2718
00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:35,799
the forest in a very shallow stream and
 

2719
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,190
the forest in a very shallow stream and
see a sizable Anaconda looking for a

2720
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:38,200
see a sizable Anaconda looking for a
 

2721
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,230
see a sizable Anaconda looking for a
meal so in a shallow

2722
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:40,240
meal so in a shallow
 

2723
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,990
meal so in a shallow
stream it moves not just in the water

2724
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:43,000
stream it moves not just in the water
 

2725
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,630
stream it moves not just in the water
but in the sand yeah so it's it also

2726
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:45,640
but in the sand yeah so it's it also
 

2727
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,950
but in the sand yeah so it's it also
likes so to borrow a little bit they

2728
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:47,960
likes so to borrow a little bit they
 

2729
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,990
likes so to borrow a little bit they
borrow quite a bit and so these large

2730
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:51,000
borrow quite a bit and so these large
 

2731
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,589
borrow quite a bit and so these large
snakes

2732
00:50:52,589 --> 00:50:52,599
snakes
 

2733
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,750
snakes
operate Subterranean more than we think

2734
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:55,760
operate Subterranean more than we think
 

2735
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,030
operate Subterranean more than we think
interesting like there's there's times

2736
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:57,040
interesting like there's there's times
 

2737
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,910
interesting like there's there's times
that you'll go with a Tracker you go

2738
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:58,920
that you'll go with a Tracker you go
 

2739
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,870
that you'll go with a Tracker you go
with a Telemetry set and it'll

2740
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:00,880
with a Telemetry set and it'll
 

2741
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,750
with a Telemetry set and it'll
say like we'll be over the snake the

2742
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
say like we'll be over the snake the
 

2743
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,670
say like we'll be over the snake the
snake's underground snake has found

2744
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:05,680
snake's underground snake has found
 

2745
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,270
snake's underground snake has found
either a recess under the sides of the

2746
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:07,280
either a recess under the sides of the
 

2747
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,950
either a recess under the sides of the
stream you saw it last night where all

2748
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:09,960
stream you saw it last night where all
 

2749
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,030
stream you saw it last night where all
the fish have have their holes under the

2750
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:12,040
the fish have have their holes under the
 

2751
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,870
the fish have have their holes under the
side of the stream there was a there was

2752
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:13,880
side of the stream there was a there was
 

2753
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,470
side of the stream there was a there was
a six foot dwarf came in right in the

2754
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:16,480
a six foot dwarf came in right in the
 

2755
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,589
a six foot dwarf came in right in the
Stream right where we were standing he

2756
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:18,599
Stream right where we were standing he
 

2757
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:21,069
Stream right where we were standing he
had his cave he goes under there they

2758
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:21,079
had his cave he goes under there they
 

2759
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:23,030
had his cave he goes under there they
know they have their system yeah we

2760
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:23,040
know they have their system yeah we
 

2761
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,030
know they have their system yeah we
walked by it we walked by it and he

2762
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,040
walked by it we walked by it and he
 

2763
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,349
walked by it we walked by it and he
stuck his head out cuz he thought we'd

2764
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:26,359
stuck his head out cuz he thought we'd
 

2765
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:27,190
stuck his head out cuz he thought we'd
gone

2766
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
gone
 

2767
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,990
gone
and then we turned around and I just got

2768
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:29,000
and then we turned around and I just got
 

2769
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,190
and then we turned around and I just got
a glimpse of him cuz I was in the front

2770
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:30,200
a glimpse of him cuz I was in the front
 

2771
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,430
a glimpse of him cuz I was in the front
of the line and he just went right back

2772
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:32,440
of the line and he just went right back
 

2773
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,910
of the line and he just went right back
into his cave you you guys are not going

2774
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:34,920
into his cave you you guys are not going
 

2775
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,030
into his cave you you guys are not going
to touch me and so yeah with the

2776
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:37,040
to touch me and so yeah with the
 

2777
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,750
to touch me and so yeah with the
anacondas it's been really exciting and

2779
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,549
anacondas it's been really exciting and
uh in

2780
00:51:41,549 --> 00:51:41,559
uh in

2014 JJ and me and Mosen and Pat and Lee
 

2783
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:48,030
2014 JJ and me and Mosen and Pat and Lee
we all we ended up catching what at the

2784
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:48,040
we all we ended up catching what at the
 

2785
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,270
we all we ended up catching what at the
time was the record for uni Marin

2786
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:50,280
time was the record for uni Marin
 

2787
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,750
time was the record for uni Marin
scientifically measured it was 18 feet 6

2788
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:52,760
scientifically measured it was 18 feet 6
 

2789
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,829
scientifically measured it was 18 feet 6
inches 220 pounds one of the largest

2790
00:51:54,829 --> 00:51:54,839
inches 220 pounds one of the largest
 

2791
00:51:54,839 --> 00:51:57,510
inches 220 pounds one of the largest
female anacondas on record

2792
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:57,520
female anacondas on record
 

2793
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,230
female anacondas on record
and since that time these guys have been

2794
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,240
and since that time these guys have been
 

2795
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,950
and since that time these guys have been
continuing to study the species

2796
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:01,960
continuing to study the species
 

2797
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,789
continuing to study the species
continuing to just again just add a

2798
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:03,799
continuing to just again just add a
 

2799
00:52:03,799 --> 00:52:05,349
continuing to just again just add a
little bit by little bit to the

2800
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:05,359
little bit by little bit to the
 

2801
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,390
little bit by little bit to the
knowledge we have of the species and

2802
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:07,400
knowledge we have of the species and
 

2803
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,150
knowledge we have of the species and
studying green anacondas in lowland

2804
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
studying green anacondas in lowland
 

2805
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,950
studying green anacondas in lowland
tropical rainforest you've seen how hard

2806
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:11,960
tropical rainforest you've seen how hard
 

2807
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,710
tropical rainforest you've seen how hard
it is to to move to operate to navigate

2808
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:15,720
it is to to move to operate to navigate
 

2809
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,589
it is to to move to operate to navigate
in this environment and so when you

2810
00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:18,599
in this environment and so when you
 

2811
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:21,150
in this environment and so when you
think of the fact that in order to learn

2812
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:21,160
think of the fact that in order to learn
 

2813
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,950
think of the fact that in order to learn
anything about this species you have to

2814
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:22,960
anything about this species you have to
 

2815
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,990
anything about this species you have to
spend vast amounts of time first

2816
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:25,000
spend vast amounts of time first
 

2817
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,030
spend vast amounts of time first
locating them

2818
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:27,040
locating them
 

2819
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,510
locating them
and then finding out a way to keep tabs

2820
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,520
and then finding out a way to keep tabs
 

2821
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,230
and then finding out a way to keep tabs
on them because even if you get lucky

2822
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:31,240
on them because even if you get lucky
 

2823
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,510
on them because even if you get lucky
enough to see an Anaconda by the edge of

2824
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,520
enough to see an Anaconda by the edge of
 

2825
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,109
enough to see an Anaconda by the edge of
a a stream to to be able to observe it

2826
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
a a stream to to be able to observe it
 

2827
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,270
a a stream to to be able to observe it
over time to learn its habits or to put

2828
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:39,280
over time to learn its habits or to put
 

2829
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,549
over time to learn its habits or to put
a radio transmitter on it or to take any

2830
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:41,559
a radio transmitter on it or to take any
 

2831
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:44,230
a radio transmitter on it or to take any
sort of valuable information from the

2832
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:44,240
sort of valuable information from the
 

2833
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,430
sort of valuable information from the
experience is almost impossible and so a

2834
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:47,440
experience is almost impossible and so a
 

2835
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,589
experience is almost impossible and so a
lot of the stuff that I wrote about

2836
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:48,599
lot of the stuff that I wrote about
 

2837
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:50,549
lot of the stuff that I wrote about
Mother of God us jumping on anacondas

2838
00:52:50,549 --> 00:52:50,559
Mother of God us jumping on anacondas
 

2839
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,750
Mother of God us jumping on anacondas
and trying to catch them and at first it

2840
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:52,760
and trying to catch them and at first it
 

2841
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,390
and trying to catch them and at first it
just seemed like something we were doing

2842
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:55,400
just seemed like something we were doing
 

2843
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,470
just seemed like something we were doing
to learn to to just try and see them but

2844
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:57,480
to learn to to just try and see them but
 

2845
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,950
to learn to to just try and see them but
it ended up being that we were wildly

2846
00:52:59,950 --> 00:52:59,960
it ended up being that we were wildly
 

2847
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,670
it ended up being that we were wildly
trying to figure out methodology that

2848
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:01,680
trying to figure out methodology that
 

2849
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,230
trying to figure out methodology that
would have scientific implications later

2850
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:03,240
would have scientific implications later
 

2851
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,589
would have scientific implications later
on because now it's allowing us to try

2852
00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:05,599
on because now it's allowing us to try
 

2853
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,710
on because now it's allowing us to try
and find the largest anacondas and

2854
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:07,720
and find the largest anacondas and
 

2855
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,109
and find the largest anacondas and
people used to say there's no way there

2856
00:53:09,109 --> 00:53:09,119
people used to say there's no way there
 

2857
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,829
people used to say there's no way there
25 foot 27 foot well there was just that

2858
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
25 foot 27 foot well there was just that
 

2859
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,309
25 foot 27 foot well there was just that
video of the guy swimming with the 20

2860
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:13,319
video of the guy swimming with the 20
 

2861
00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:15,950
video of the guy swimming with the 20
foot anaconda and so now as we keep

2862
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:15,960
foot anaconda and so now as we keep
 

2863
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,710
foot anaconda and so now as we keep
going I'm going well maybe through drone

2864
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:18,720
going I'm going well maybe through drone
 

2865
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,630
going I'm going well maybe through drone
identification we could find where the

2866
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:20,640
identification we could find where the
 

2867
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,710
identification we could find where the
largest anacondas are sitting on top of

2868
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
largest anacondas are sitting on top of
 

2869
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,549
largest anacondas are sitting on top of
floating vegetation and even then how do

2870
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:25,559
floating vegetation and even then how do
 

2871
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:27,470
floating vegetation and even then how do
we restrain them so that we could

2872
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:27,480
we restrain them so that we could
 

2873
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,670
we restrain them so that we could
measure them and prove this to the world

2874
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:29,680
measure them and prove this to the world
 

2875
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,829
measure them and prove this to the world
it's sort of a side quest but so by

2876
00:53:32,829 --> 00:53:32,839
it's sort of a side quest but so by
 

2877
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:34,309
it's sort of a side quest but so by
doing these kinds of studies you figure

2878
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,319
doing these kinds of studies you figure
 

2879
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,670
doing these kinds of studies you figure
out how they move about the world what

2880
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:36,680
out how they move about the world what
 

2881
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,109
out how they move about the world what
motivates them in terms of when they

2882
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:38,119
motivates them in terms of when they
 

2883
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:40,910
motivates them in terms of when they
hunt where they hide in the world as the

2884
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:40,920
hunt where they hide in the world as the
 

2885
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,190
hunt where they hide in the world as the
size of the anacon change so all of that

2886
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:43,200
size of the anacon change so all of that
 

2887
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,750
size of the anacon change so all of that
that's that's those are scientific

2888
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:44,760
that's that's those are scientific
 

2889
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,670
that's that's those are scientific
studies yeah I mean look there's so much

2890
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:47,680
studies yeah I mean look there's so much
 

2891
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,030
studies yeah I mean look there's so much
that we don't know about this Forest we

2892
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,040
that we don't know about this Forest we
 

2893
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,309
that we don't know about this Forest we
don't know what medicines are in this

2894
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
don't know what medicines are in this
 

2895
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:53,190
don't know what medicines are in this
Forest we don't know with a lot of the

2897
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,109
Forest we don't know with a lot of the

and each of the caterpillars has a
 

2909
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,230

that fill the butterfly book we don't
 

2919
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,549
that fill the butterfly book we don't
know what those interactions are I

recently got to see a the White Witch

2922
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:21,319
recently got to see a the White Witch
 

2923
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:23,510
recently got to see a the White Witch
which is a huge moth it's it's one of

2924
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
which is a huge moth it's it's one of
 

2925
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,109
which is a huge moth it's it's one of
the it's it's one of the two largest

2926
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
the it's it's one of the two largest
 

2927
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,950
the it's it's one of the two largest
moths in the world it's the largest just

2928
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:26,960
moths in the world it's the largest just
 

2929
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:30,030
moths in the world it's the largest just
moth by wing span wow huge it looks like

penis-shaped rocket ships like we don't
 

2941
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,789
penis-shaped rocket ships like we don't
know where that moth starts its life

00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:47,720
yeah we still haven't figured that out
 

2945
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,190
yeah we still haven't figured that out
by the way the rocket ships are shaped

2946
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
by the way the rocket ships are shaped
 

2947
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,030
by the way the rocket ships are shaped
that way for efficiency purposes not

2948
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,040
that way for efficiency purposes not
 

2949
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,510
that way for efficiency purposes not
because they wanted to look make it look

2950

studies you've done of the two animals
 

3007
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,430
studies you've done of the two animals
species in the baddest you're talking

3008
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:54,440
species in the baddest you're talking
 

3009
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,510
species in the baddest you're talking
about an 18t several 100 lb black cayman

3010
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
about an 18t several 100 lb black cayman
 

3011
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,910
about an 18t several 100 lb black cayman
versus a 26 foot 350 lb

3012
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:02,920
versus a 26 foot 350 lb
 

3013
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,190
versus a 26 foot 350 lb
Anaconda yeah I think it's a it's a it's

3014
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:06,200
Anaconda yeah I think it's a it's a it's
 

3015
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,470
Anaconda yeah I think it's a it's a it's
a death stalemate I think the Cayman

3016
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480
a death stalemate I think the Cayman
 

3017
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,470
a death stalemate I think the Cayman
slams the anaconda bites onto it the

3018
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:10,480
slams the anaconda bites onto it the
 

3019
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,069
slams the anaconda bites onto it the
Anaconda wraps the Cayman and then they

3020
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:12,079
Anaconda wraps the Cayman and then they
 

3021
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:13,750
Anaconda wraps the Cayman and then they
both thrash around until they both kill

3022
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:13,760
both thrash around until they both kill
 

3023
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,150
both thrash around until they both kill
each other because I think the the cay

3024
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:15,160
each other because I think the the cay
 

3025
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,349
each other because I think the the cay
will tear him up so bad and the cayman's

3026
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:17,359
will tear him up so bad and the cayman's
 

3027
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,829
will tear him up so bad and the cayman's
not going to let go he's going to is

3028
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:18,839
not going to let go he's going to is
 

3029
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:19,990
not going to let go he's going to is
never going to let go but then he's

3030
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
never going to let go but then he's
 

3031
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,670
never going to let go but then he's
gonna he's going to realize that he's

3032
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:21,680
gonna he's going to realize that he's
 

3033
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,230
gonna he's going to realize that he's
he's also being constricted so then he's

3034
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:23,240
he's also being constricted so then he's
 

3035
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,390
he's also being constricted so then he's
going to stop and he's gonna he's going

3036
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:24,400
going to stop and he's gonna he's going
 

3037
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,270
going to stop and he's gonna he's going
to keep slamming down on that anakonda

3038
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:26,280
to keep slamming down on that anakonda
 

3039
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,990
to keep slamming down on that anakonda
mhm and the anacon is just going to keep

3040
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:28,000
mhm and the anacon is just going to keep
 

3041
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,510
mhm and the anacon is just going to keep
constricting but if the Cayman can do

3042
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:29,520
constricting but if the Cayman can do
 

3043
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,710
constricting but if the Cayman can do
enough damage before the an again it's

3044
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:31,720
enough damage before the an again it's
 

3045
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,870
enough damage before the an again it's
almost like a Striker versus a Jiu-Jitsu

3046
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:33,880
almost like a Striker versus a Jiu-Jitsu
 

3047
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,309
almost like a Striker versus a Jiu-Jitsu
yeah you know if you can get enough

is the construction so it's pretty slow
 

3053
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,029
is the construction so it's pretty slow
it's it's no it's it's incredibly it's

00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:08,549
unwrap the tail help you but for an
animal like if a deer gets hit by an an

3080
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:08,559
animal like if a deer gets hit by an an
 

3081
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,829
animal like if a deer gets hit by an an
no way they don't stand a chance so the

3082
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
no way they don't stand a chance so the
 

3083
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:15,029
no way they don't stand a chance so the
the the black C would bite somewhere

3084
00:57:15,029 --> 00:57:15,039
the the black C would bite somewhere
 

3085
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:17,630
the the black C would bite somewhere
somewhere close to the head and then and

3086
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:17,640
somewhere close to the head and then and
 

3087
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,670
somewhere close to the head and then and
just try to hold on and thrash yeah I

3088
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:19,680
just try to hold on and thrash yeah I
 

3089
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,870
just try to hold on and thrash yeah I
don't I don't think a large black cayman

3090
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:21,880
don't I don't think a large black cayman
 

3091
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,430
don't I don't think a large black cayman
here's the thing every fisherman knows

3092
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:24,440
here's the thing every fisherman knows
 

3093
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,190
here's the thing every fisherman knows
this like the biggest fish they're smart

3094
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
this like the biggest fish they're smart
 

3095
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,870
this like the biggest fish they're smart
yeah and more importantly they're shrewd

3096
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:29,880
yeah and more importantly they're shrewd
 

3097
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,710
yeah and more importantly they're shrewd
they're careful a huge black cayman

3098
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:32,720
they're careful a huge black cayman
 

3099
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,109
they're careful a huge black cayman
that's 16 ft long isn't going to be

3100
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:35,119
that's 16 ft long isn't going to be
 

3101
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,150
that's 16 ft long isn't going to be
messing with a big anacon like they they

3102
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:37,160
messing with a big anacon like they they
 

3103
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,069
messing with a big anacon like they they
they'll they won't they won't cross

3104
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:39,079
they'll they won't they won't cross
 

3105
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:42,670
they'll they won't they won't cross
paths because while they technically

3106
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:42,680
paths because while they technically
 

3107
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,870
paths because while they technically
occupy the same type of environment that

3108
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:45,880
occupy the same type of environment that
 

3109
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,670
occupy the same type of environment that
black cayman's going to have this deep

3110
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
black cayman's going to have this deep
 

3111
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,589
black cayman's going to have this deep
spot in a lake and that anaka is going

3112
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:49,599
spot in a lake and that anaka is going
 

3113
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,549
spot in a lake and that anaka is going
to have found this floating Forest like

3114
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:51,559
to have found this floating Forest like
 

3115
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:53,510
to have found this floating Forest like
sort of black stream backwat where it's

3116
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
sort of black stream backwat where it's
 

3117
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,029
sort of black stream backwat where it's
going to be and they'll have made that

3118
00:57:55,029 --> 00:57:55,039
going to be and they'll have made that
 

3119
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,630
going to be and they'll have made that
their home for decades they'll already

3120
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:56,640
their home for decades they'll already
 

3121
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,190
their home for decades they'll already
have cleaned out the competition so

3122
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:58,200
have cleaned out the competition so
 

3123
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,710
have cleaned out the competition so
maybe if there was a flood and they got

3124
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
maybe if there was a flood and they got
 

3125
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,230
maybe if there was a flood and they got
pushed together that they they could

3126
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:02,240
pushed together that they they could
 

3127
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,750
pushed together that they they could
have some sort of a showdown but almost

3128
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:04,760
have some sort of a showdown but almost
 

3129
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,270
have some sort of a showdown but almost
more certainly is that when they get to

3130
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:06,280
more certainly is that when they get to
 

3131
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,069
more certainly is that when they get to
that size that Cayman at any sign of

3132
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:09,079
that size that Cayman at any sign of
 

3133
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:11,630
that size that Cayman at any sign of
danger Bloom right under the water just

3134
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:11,640
danger Bloom right under the water just
 

3135
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,630
danger Bloom right under the water just
you it's almost like it's like even if

3136
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:13,640
you it's almost like it's like even if
 

3137
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,789
you it's almost like it's like even if
you what do you learn when you're a

3138
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:14,799
you what do you learn when you're a
 

3139
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,910
you what do you learn when you're a
black belt you know what what do you do

3140
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:16,920
black belt you know what what do you do
 

3141
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,710
black belt you know what what do you do
with a street fight you still run away

3142
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:18,720
with a street fight you still run away
 

3143
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,710
with a street fight you still run away
mhm there's no reason for a street fight

3144
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:21,720
mhm there's no reason for a street fight
 

3145
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,150
mhm there's no reason for a street fight
and I think the animals really

3146
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:23,160
and I think the animals really
 

3147
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,109
and I think the animals really
understand that no there's no reason for

3148
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:25,119
understand that no there's no reason for
 

3149
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,829
understand that no there's no reason for
this so like like a giant anacon and a

3150
00:58:27,829 --> 00:58:27,839
this so like like a giant anacon and a
 

3151
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,670
this so like like a giant anacon and a
giant black hman they could probably

3152
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:29,680
giant black hman they could probably
 

3153
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,349
giant black hman they could probably
even coexist in the same environment

3154
00:58:31,349 --> 00:58:31,359
even coexist in the same environment
 

3155
00:58:31,359 --> 00:58:32,390
even coexist in the same environment
just

3156
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:32,400
just
 

3157
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,029
just
knowing using the wisdom to avoid the

3158
00:58:35,029 --> 00:58:35,039
knowing using the wisdom to avoid the
 

3159
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:36,910
knowing using the wisdom to avoid the
fight like why or they would have a big

3160
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:36,920
fight like why or they would have a big
 

3161
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,710
fight like why or they would have a big
Showdown and one of them would either

3162
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:38,720
Showdown and one of them would either
 

3163
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,470
Showdown and one of them would either
die or have to leave they would have a

3164
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:40,480
die or have to leave they would have a
 

3165
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,670
die or have to leave they would have a
territorial dispute yeah yeah without

3166
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,680
territorial dispute yeah yeah without
 

3167
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,750
territorial dispute yeah yeah without
killing either of them yeah I dude n

3168
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:47,760
killing either of them yeah I dude n
 

3169
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,190
killing either of them yeah I dude n
nature Anything Could Happen one of the

3170
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:50,200
nature Anything Could Happen one of the
 

3171
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,789
nature Anything Could Happen one of the
things that me and Pat wrote up was that

3172
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:51,799
things that me and Pat wrote up was that
 

3173
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:54,630
things that me and Pat wrote up was that
I saw a yellow tailed crepo which is

3174
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:54,640
I saw a yellow tailed crepo which is
 

3175
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,510
I saw a yellow tailed crepo which is
like a six foot rat snake eating an

3176
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:56,520
like a six foot rat snake eating an
 

3177
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:59,230
like a six foot rat snake eating an
oxyopes mogenis which is the the the red

3178
00:58:59,230 --> 00:58:59,240
oxyopes mogenis which is the the the red
 

3179
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,150
oxyopes mogenis which is the the the red
snake that we found last night and just

3180
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
snake that we found last night and just
 

3181
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,510
snake that we found last night and just
no one had ever in scientific literature

3182
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:04,520
no one had ever in scientific literature
 

3183
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,430
no one had ever in scientific literature
we'd never seen a crebo eating an

3184
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:06,440
we'd never seen a crebo eating an
 

3185
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,150
we'd never seen a crebo eating an
oxyopes before and so I had the

3186
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:09,160
oxyopes before and so I had the
 

3187
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,670
oxyopes before and so I had the
observation in the field I sent it to

3188
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:10,680
observation in the field I sent it to
 

3189
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,829
observation in the field I sent it to
Pat champagne Pat writes it up paper and

3190
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:13,839
Pat champagne Pat writes it up paper and
 

3191
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,750
Pat champagne Pat writes it up paper and
so it's like it's this really cool

3192
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:15,760
so it's like it's this really cool
 

3193
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,910
so it's like it's this really cool
that's a really cool system because

3194
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:16,920
that's a really cool system because
 

3195
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,349
that's a really cool system because
we're just out here all the time you end

3196
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:18,359
we're just out here all the time you end
 

3197
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,549
we're just out here all the time you end

predatory instincts but I also think
 

3273
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,789
predatory instincts but I also think
there is a playfulness to higher

3277
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,309
intelligence animals that you don't see
in lower intelligence animals and so

3278
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
in lower intelligence animals and so
 

3279
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,430
in lower intelligence animals and so
something like a rabbit for instance

01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:57,880
just you can't even think of it like
 

3287
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,870
just you can't even think of it like
that like a rabbit's just going to

3288
01:00:58,870 --> 01:00:58,880
that like a rabbit's just going to
 

3289
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,670
that like a rabbit's just going to
either eat or run away there's really

3290
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:00,680
either eat or run away there's really
 

3291
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,069
either eat or run away there's really
two settings when you think of something

3292
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:03,079
two settings when you think of something
 

3293
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:05,349
two settings when you think of something
like a RI giant

3294
01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:05,359
like a RI giant
 

3295
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:08,069
like a RI giant
riverter or a Tyra which is a they call

3296

riverter or a Tyra which is a they call
 

3297
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,950
riverter or a Tyra which is a they call
it MCO here it's a it's a huge arboreal

3298
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
it MCO here it's a it's a huge arboreal

woke up at my house the other day and
 

3303
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:18,150
woke up at my house the other day and
there was a Tyra climbing up the side of

sleeping and it's like he came to check
me out like it's like they're smart

3310
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:25,359
me out like it's like they're smart
 

3311
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,069
me out like it's like they're smart
enough and they're brave enough here's

3312
01:01:27,069 --> 01:01:27,079
enough and they're brave enough here's
 

3313
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:28,470
enough and they're brave enough here's
the important thing they know that they

3314
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:28,480
the important thing they know that they
 

3315
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,029
the important thing they know that they
can fend for themselves they can fight

3316
01:01:30,029 --> 01:01:30,039
can fend for themselves they can fight
 

3317
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:31,910
can fend for themselves they can fight
they can climb they can run and so

3318
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
they can climb they can run and so
 

3319
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,670
they can climb they can run and so
they're like let me I'm curious I got

3320
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:34,680
they're like let me I'm curious I got
 

3321
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,150
they're like let me I'm curious I got
time let me check this out yeah they're

3322
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:36,160
time let me check this out yeah they're
 

3323
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,750
time let me check this out yeah they're
gathering information I wonder how

3324
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
gathering information I wonder how
 

3325
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,710
gathering information I wonder how
complex and sophisticated their world

3326
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:39,720
complex and sophisticated their world
 

3327
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,950
complex and sophisticated their world
world model is like how they're

3328
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:41,960
world model is like how they're
 

3329
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,589
world model is like how they're
integrating all the information about

3330
01:01:43,589 --> 01:01:43,599
integrating all the information about
 

3331
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,150
integrating all the information about
the environment like where all the

3332
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:45,160
the environment like where all the
 

3333
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,470
the environment like where all the
different trees are where all the

3334
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:46,480
different trees are where all the
 

3335
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,549
different trees are where all the
different nests of the different insects

3336
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
different nests of the different insects
 

3337
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:50,789
different nests of the different insects
are what the different creatures are by

3338
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:50,799
are what the different creatures are by
 

3339
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,630
are what the different creatures are by
size all that kind of stuff I'm I'm sure

3340
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:52,640
size all that kind of stuff I'm I'm sure
 

3341
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,390
size all that kind of stuff I'm I'm sure
they don't have enough you know storage

3342
01:01:55,390 --> 01:01:55,400
they don't have enough you know storage
 

3343
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,390
they don't have enough you know storage
up there

3344
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:56,400
up there
 

3345
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,390
up there
to like keep all that but they probably

3346
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:58,400
to like keep all that but they probably
 

3347
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,109
to like keep all that but they probably
keep the important stuff basic you know

3348
01:02:01,109 --> 01:02:01,119
keep the important stuff basic you know
 

3349
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,829
keep the important stuff basic you know
so sort of integrate the experiences

3350
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:02,839
so sort of integrate the experiences
 

3351
01:02:02,839 --> 01:02:04,750
so sort of integrate the experiences
they have into like what is dangerous

3352
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:04,760
they have into like what is dangerous
 

3353
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,950
they have into like what is dangerous
what is tasty all that kind of stuff I

3354
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:07,960
what is tasty all that kind of stuff I
 

3355
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,190
what is tasty all that kind of stuff I
think it's more complex than we realize

3356
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:12,200
think it's more complex than we realize
 

3357
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,230
think it's more complex than we realize
you go back to that friend's dewal book

3358
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,240
you go back to that friend's dewal book
 

3359
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,549
you go back to that friend's dewal book
are we smart enough to know how smart

3360
01:02:15,549 --> 01:02:15,559
are we smart enough to know how smart
 

3361
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,589
are we smart enough to know how smart
animals are there's so many incredible

3362
01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:17,599
animals are there's so many incredible
 

3363
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,510
animals are there's so many incredible
examples of controlled studies where the

3364
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:21,520
examples of controlled studies where the
 

3365
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,309
examples of controlled studies where the
researchers weren't understanding How to

3366
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:25,319
researchers weren't understanding How to
 

3367
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:28,309
researchers weren't understanding How to
shed being so insurmountably human and

3368
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
shed being so insurmountably human and
 

3369
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,029
shed being so insurmountably human and
understand that there are other types of

3370
01:02:30,029 --> 01:02:30,039
understand that there are other types of
 

3371
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,589
understand that there are other types of
intelligent and whether that's Elephants

3372
01:02:32,589 --> 01:02:32,599
intelligent and whether that's Elephants
 

3373
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:36,029
intelligent and whether that's Elephants
or cats so big cats for instance we just

3374
01:02:36,029 --> 01:02:36,039
or cats so big cats for instance we just
 

3375
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:39,309
or cats so big cats for instance we just
saw a camera trap video from last night

3376
01:02:39,309 --> 01:02:39,319
saw a camera trap video from last night
 

3377
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:41,870
saw a camera trap video from last night
yeah where you see one of our workers

3378
01:02:41,870 --> 01:02:41,880
yeah where you see one of our workers
 

3379
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,069
yeah where you see one of our workers
walk down the trail and then 5 minutes

3380
01:02:44,069 --> 01:02:44,079
walk down the trail and then 5 minutes
 

3381
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:46,390
walk down the trail and then 5 minutes
later a cat behind them by the way we're

3382
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
later a cat behind them by the way we're
 

3383
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,870
later a cat behind them by the way we're

01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,549
step through a dense jungle it could be
an innocent placing of a hand on that

3538
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:52,559
an innocent placing of a hand on that
 

3539
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,630
an innocent placing of a hand on that
tree that could just completely

3540
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:55,640
tree that could just completely
 

3541
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:59,309
tree that could just completely
transform your experience your life by

3542

transform your experience your life by
 

3543
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:03,230
transform your experience your life by
penetrating your hand with like 20 30 40

3544
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:03,240
penetrating your hand with like 20 30 40
 

3545
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:06,349
penetrating your hand with like 20 30 40
50 spikes yeah and just changing

3546
01:06:06,349 --> 01:06:06,359
50 spikes yeah and just changing
 

3547
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:08,269
50 spikes yeah and just changing
everything that's just a completely

3548
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:08,279
everything that's just a completely
 

3549
01:06:08,279 --> 01:06:09,870
everything that's just a completely
different experience than going on on a

3550
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:09,880
different experience than going on on a
 

3551
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,069
different experience than going on on a
trail where you where you're Observer of

3552
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:12,079
trail where you where you're Observer of
 

3553
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:14,789
trail where you where you're Observer of
the Jungle versus the participant of it

3554
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:14,799
the Jungle versus the participant of it
 

3555
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:18,950
the Jungle versus the participant of it
and and it truly is extreme hard work to

3556
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:18,960
and and it truly is extreme hard work to
 

3557
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,829
and and it truly is extreme hard work to
take every single step now just think

3558
01:06:20,829 --> 01:06:20,839
take every single step now just think
 

3559
01:06:20,839 --> 01:06:22,470
take every single step now just think
about this I think scientifically cuz

3560
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:22,480
about this I think scientifically cuz
 

3561
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,230
about this I think scientifically cuz
people like to summarize people like to

3562
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240
people like to summarize people like to
 

3563
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,750
people like to summarize people like to
get really really uh sort of cavalier

get really really uh sort of cavalier
 

3565
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,430
get really really uh sort of cavalier
with our scientific progress and they go

3566
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:28,440
with our scientific progress and they go
 

3567
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,349
with our scientific progress and they go
you know we've already explored the

3568
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:29,359
you know we've already explored the
 

3569
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:31,670
you know we've already explored the
Amazon it's like well have we because in

3570
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
Amazon it's like well have we because in
 

3571
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,150
Amazon it's like well have we because in
between each tributary is you know let's

3572
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,160
between each tributary is you know let's
 

3573
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,430
between each tributary is you know let's
say just between some of them let's just

3574
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:35,440
say just between some of them let's just
 

3575
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,910
say just between some of them let's just
say 100 miles of of unbroken Forest

3576
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:38,920
say 100 miles of of unbroken Forest
 

3577
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,309
say 100 miles of of unbroken Forest
who's explored that yeah maybe some of

3578
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:41,319
who's explored that yeah maybe some of
 

3579
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:43,870
who's explored that yeah maybe some of
the tribes have been there maybe some

3580
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:43,880
the tribes have been there maybe some
 

3581
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,230
the tribes have been there maybe some
areas they haven't been now when you're

3582
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:46,240
areas they haven't been now when you're
 

3583
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,630
areas they haven't been now when you're
talking about scientists whether they're

3584
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:48,640
talking about scientists whether they're
 

3585
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,829

enough I see all the phds come down here
 

3599
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,750
enough I see all the phds come down here
and they all go to the same few research

3600
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:05,760
and they all go to the same few research
 

3601
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,549
and they all go to the same few research
stations they're safe they have a bed if

stations they're safe they have a bed if
 

3603
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,750
stations they're safe they have a bed if
you get Hella dropped into the middle of

little species variations you're going
 

3613
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,029
little species variations you're going
to see a type of flower that JJ's never

01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:20,039
to see a type of flower that JJ's never
 

3615

what kind of can can you talk talk more
 

3647
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,589
what kind of can can you talk talk more
about that paper mammal diversity along

3648

Rangers got featured because they're the
 

3665
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,030
Rangers got featured because they're the
ones that spotted a pygmy marma set that

01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:16,040
ones that spotted a pygmy marma set that
 

3667
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:18,030
ones that spotted a pygmy marma set that
had previously been unrecorded on the

river I got to I got to contribute

3670
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:20,719
river I got to I got to contribute
 

3671
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,870
river I got to I got to contribute
because I had I had the only photograph

3672
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:23,880
because I had I had the only photograph
 

3673
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,149
because I had I had the only photograph
that I believe anyone has of an emperor

Tamarind on this River it's the first

3676
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:28,480
Tamarind on this River it's the first
 

3677
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,349
Tamarind on this River it's the first
proof of Emperor Tamarind on this River

proof of Emperor Tamarind on this River
 

3679
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,189
proof of Emperor Tamarind on this River
and that's exciting it's exciting

3680
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:33,199
and that's exciting it's exciting
 

3681
01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:36,990
and that's exciting it's exciting
because um you know you'll you can post

3682
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:37,000
because um you know you'll you can post
 

3683
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,950
because um you know you'll you can post
post a picture or share a scientific

3684
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:38,960
post a picture or share a scientific
 

3685
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,630
post a picture or share a scientific
observation or write about something and

observation or write about something and
 

3687
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,789
observation or write about something and
then what happens is you get these these

3688
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:42,799
then what happens is you get these these
 

3689
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,550
then what happens is you get these these
like couch experts these armchair

MAA there I can tell from my bird book

3696
01:08:50,349 --> 01:08:50,359
MAA there I can tell from my bird book
 

3697
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,030
MAA there I can tell from my bird book
it says they're not there and they'll

3698
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:52,040
it says they're not there and they'll
 

3699
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,709
it says they're not there and they'll
tell you you're wrong you know no you

3700
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:53,719
tell you you're wrong you know no you
 

3701

emperor CH it's like but but we but we
 

3705
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,990
emperor CH it's like but but we but we
have proof and so we're coming together

have proof and so we're coming together
 

3707
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,030
have proof and so we're coming together
to try and add to that knowledge my

3708
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:02,040
to try and add to that knowledge my
 

3709
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,630
to try and add to that knowledge my
general sort of amateur experience of

3710
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:03,640
general sort of amateur experience of
 

3711
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:05,390
general sort of amateur experience of
the species I've encountered here is

3712
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:05,400
the species I've encountered here is
 

3713
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,470
the species I've encountered here is
like this should not exist whatever this

3714
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,480
like this should not exist whatever this
 

3715
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:12,590
like this should not exist whatever this
is this is not real this is CGI like

3716
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:12,600
is this is not real this is CGI like
 

3717
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,229
is this is not real this is CGI like
what just the colors the weirdness I

3718
01:09:15,229 --> 01:09:15,239
what just the colors the weirdness I
 

3719
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:18,110
what just the colors the weirdness I
mean there's uh I think I called it the

3720
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,120
mean there's uh I think I called it the
 

3721
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,269
mean there's uh I think I called it the
the Paris Hilton uh caterpillar because

3722
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:20,279
the Paris Hilton uh caterpillar because
 

3723
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:23,470
the Paris Hilton uh caterpillar because
it's like fur it looks like a of's dog

3724
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:23,480
it's like fur it looks like a of's dog
 

3725

do you think there are species like how

3736
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:36,600
do you think there are species like how
 

3737
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,630
do you think there are species like how
many species have we not discovered and

3738
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:38,640
many species have we not discovered and
 

3739
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,470
many species have we not discovered and
is there species that are like extremely

3740
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:41,480
is there species that are like extremely
 

3741
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,789
is there species that are like extremely
badass that we haven't discovered yet if

3742
01:09:43,789 --> 01:09:43,799
badass that we haven't discovered yet if
 

3743
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:45,749
badass that we haven't discovered yet if
you look up how

3744
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:45,759
you look up how
 

3745
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,590
you look up how
many trees are in the Amazon rainforest

many trees are in the Amazon rainforest
 

3747
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,669

01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,480
but what what do we know what host plant
 

3795
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,830

do they use for their caterpillars

3796
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:52,840
do they use for their caterpillars
 

3797
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,790
do they use for their caterpillars
what's their geographical range what

what's their geographical range what
 

3799
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,790
what's their geographical range what
what do we actually no not that much so

01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,790
haven't been described absolutely and
some of them could be extremely

3806
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:02,800
some of them could be extremely
 

3807
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,470
some of them could be extremely
effective uh predators in a nich

3808
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:05,480
effective uh predators in a nich
 

3809
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,750
effective uh predators in a nich
environment yeah absolutely I mean

3810
01:11:07,750 --> 01:11:07,760
environment yeah absolutely I mean
 

3811
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,870
environment yeah absolutely I mean
certainly certainly in the canopy 50% of

01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:10,880
certainly certainly in the canopy 50% of
 

3813
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,189
certainly certainly in the canopy 50% of
the life in a rainforest is in the

3814
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:12,199
the life in a rainforest is in the
 

3815
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:15,390
the life in a rainforest is in the
canopy and we've had very limited access

3816
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:15,400
canopy and we've had very limited access
 

3817
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:17,750
canopy and we've had very limited access
to the canopy for all of history you

3818
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:17,760
to the canopy for all of history you
 

3819
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:18,950
to the canopy for all of history you
know if you wanted to get up into the

3820
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:18,960
know if you wanted to get up into the
 

3821
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,430
know if you wanted to get up into the
rainforest canopy you basically have to

3822
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:20,440
rainforest canopy you basically have to
 

3823
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,910
rainforest canopy you basically have to
climb a Vine or what scientists when I

3824
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:22,920
climb a Vine or what scientists when I
 

3825
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,189
climb a Vine or what scientists when I
was a kid I always used to see them with

3826
01:11:24,189 --> 01:11:24,199
was a kid I always used to see them with
 

3827
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:25,510
was a kid I always used to see them with
like the slingshots or the bow and

3828
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:25,520
like the slingshots or the bow and
 

3829
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,669
like the slingshots or the bow and
arrows they would they would shoot a a

3830
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:27,679
arrows they would they would shoot a a
 

3831
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,750
arrows they would they would shoot a a
piece of paracord over a branch Pull the

3832
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:29,760
piece of paracord over a branch Pull the
 

3833
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,149
piece of paracord over a branch Pull the
Rope up and then you know do the

3834
01:11:31,149 --> 01:11:31,159
Rope up and then you know do the
 

3835
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,430
Rope up and then you know do the
Ascension thing and then you're up in

3836
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:32,440
Ascension thing and then you're up in
 

3837
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,270
Ascension thing and then you're up in
this tree getting swarmed by sweat bees

3838
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,280
this tree getting swarmed by sweat bees
 

3839
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,430
this tree getting swarmed by sweat bees
getting stung by wasps you're trying to

3840
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:37,440
getting stung by wasps you're trying to
 

3841
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,110
getting stung by wasps you're trying to
do science up there in that environment

3842
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,120
do science up there in that environment
 

3843
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,990
do science up there in that environment
it's incredibly hostile and so having

3844
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
it's incredibly hostile and so having
 

3845
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,189
it's incredibly hostile and so having
canopy platforms I actually met a guy at

3846
01:11:44,189 --> 01:11:44,199
canopy platforms I actually met a guy at
 

3847
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:47,550
canopy platforms I actually met a guy at
a French film festival who had used hot

3848
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:47,560
a French film festival who had used hot
 

3849
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,629
a French film festival who had used hot
air balloons to float over the canopy of

3850
01:11:50,629 --> 01:11:50,639
air balloons to float over the canopy of
 

3851
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:52,830
air balloons to float over the canopy of
the Amazon and then lay these big Nets

3852
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:52,840
the Amazon and then lay these big Nets
 

3853
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,830
the Amazon and then lay these big Nets
over the over the broccoli of the of the

3854
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:54,840
over the over the broccoli of the of the
 

3855
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,189
over the over the broccoli of the of the
trees M and the Nets were dense enough

3856
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:57,199
trees M and the Nets were dense enough
 

3857
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,830
trees M and the Nets were dense enough
that humans could walk on the Nets and

3858
01:11:58,830 --> 01:11:58,840
that humans could walk on the Nets and
 

3859
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,950
that humans could walk on the Nets and
then reach through and pull cactuses and

3860
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
then reach through and pull cactuses and
 

3861
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,669
then reach through and pull cactuses and
lizards and snakes whatever just take

3862
01:12:02,669 --> 01:12:02,679
lizards and snakes whatever just take
 

3863
01:12:02,679 --> 01:12:04,430
lizards and snakes whatever just take
specimens from the canopy that's how

3864
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:04,440
specimens from the canopy that's how
 

3865
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,510
specimens from the canopy that's how
difficult it is that that scientists

3866
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:06,520
difficult it is that that scientists
 

3867
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,350
difficult it is that that scientists
have resorted to using hot air balloons

3868
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:09,360
have resorted to using hot air balloons
 

3869
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,149
have resorted to using hot air balloons
MH and so having a treehouse having

3870
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:12,159
MH and so having a treehouse having
 

3871
01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:13,590
MH and so having a treehouse having
canopy platforms having it's it's

3872
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:13,600
canopy platforms having it's it's
 

3873
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:14,790
canopy platforms having it's it's
starting to get there starting to be

3874
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:14,800
starting to get there starting to be
 

3875
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,830
starting to get there starting to be
more and more access to the rainforest

3876
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:16,840
more and more access to the rainforest
 

3877
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,590
more and more access to the rainforest
canopy and so we're beginning to log

3878
01:12:20,590 --> 01:12:20,600
canopy and so we're beginning to log
 

3879
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:23,149
canopy and so we're beginning to log
more data you know we even observed in

3880
01:12:23,149 --> 01:12:23,159
more data you know we even observed in
 

3881
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:24,830
more data you know we even observed in
our Treehouse which is supposed to be

3882
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:24,840
our Treehouse which is supposed to be
 

3883
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,149
our Treehouse which is supposed to be
the tallest in the world we're seeing

3884
01:12:27,149 --> 01:12:27,159
the tallest in the world we're seeing
 

3885
01:12:27,159 --> 01:12:28,870
the tallest in the world we're seeing
lizards that we don't see on the ground

3886
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880
lizards that we don't see on the ground
 

3887
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,229
lizards that we don't see on the ground
lizards that have never been documented

3888
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:30,239
lizards that have never been documented
 

3889
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:31,910
lizards that have never been documented
on this on this River like we're seeing

3890
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:31,920
on this on this River like we're seeing
 

3891
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,790
on this on this River like we're seeing
snakes where they're saying we saw the

3892
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:33,800
snakes where they're saying we saw the
 

3893
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,870
snakes where they're saying we saw the
snake inside a crevice on that tree in

3894
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:35,880
snake inside a crevice on that tree in
 

3895
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,350
snake inside a crevice on that tree in
the Strangler fig and we don't know what

3896
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,360
the Strangler fig and we don't know what
 

3897
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,110
the Strangler fig and we don't know what
it

01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:38,120
it
 

3899
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,470
it
is it's just people haven't been up

monkeys are that's where there's just a
 

3905
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,990
monkeys are that's where there's just a
lot of dynamic life up there yeah I mean

3906
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:48,000
lot of dynamic life up there yeah I mean
 

3907
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,110
lot of dynamic life up there yeah I mean

better stay away and so it's it's a
little bit respectful as well there is

3948
01:13:28,709 --> 01:13:28,719
little bit respectful as well there is
 

3949
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:31,350
little bit respectful as well there is
order in the chaos so just speaking of

3950
01:13:31,350 --> 01:13:31,360
order in the chaos so just speaking of
 

3951
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,310

yeah what what do you learn about
 

3967
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,709
yeah what what do you learn about
relationships for maca that that it can

3968
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:52,719
relationships for maca that that it can
 

3969
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,709
relationships for maca that that it can
be loud and rough and still be loving

3970
01:13:54,709 --> 01:13:54,719
be loud and rough and still be loving
 

3971

it's still be loving but is that
 

3973
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:57,830
it's still be loving but is that
interesting to you that there's like

3974
01:13:57,830 --> 01:13:57,840
interesting to you that there's like
 

3975
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,030
interesting to you that there's like
monogamy in some species that they

3976
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:00,040
monogamy in some species that they
 

3977
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:01,550
monogamy in some species that they
they're lifelong partners and then

3978
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:01,560
they're lifelong partners and then
 

3979
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:03,629
they're lifelong partners and then
there's like total lack of monogamy in

3980
01:14:03,629 --> 01:14:03,639
there's like total lack of monogamy in
 

3981
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,669
there's like total lack of monogamy in
other species it's all interesting I

3982
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:05,679
other species it's all interesting I
 

3983
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:07,629
other species it's all interesting I
mean there's the anti- monogamy crew

3984
01:14:07,629 --> 01:14:07,639
mean there's the anti- monogamy crew
 

3985
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:08,990
mean there's the anti- monogamy crew
who's like you know we were never meant

3986
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:09,000
who's like you know we were never meant
 

3987
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,709
who's like you know we were never meant
to be monogamous we're supposed to just

3988
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:10,719
to be monogamous we're supposed to just
 

3989
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,750
to be monogamous we're supposed to just
be animals and then there's the other

3990
01:14:12,750 --> 01:14:12,760
be animals and then there's the other
 

3991
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,669
be animals and then there's the other
side of the crew that's like we were

3992
01:14:14,669 --> 01:14:14,679
side of the crew that's like we were
 

3993
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:16,910
side of the crew that's like we were
meant to be monogamous we are monogamous

3995
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,910
meant to be monogamous we are monogamous
creatures that's what God wanted between

3996
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:18,920
creatures that's what God wanted between
 

3997
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,990
creatures that's what God wanted between
a man and a woman and then other people

3998
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:21,000
a man and a woman and then other people
 

3999
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,510
a man and a woman and then other people
like yeah but I know about these two gay

4000
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:22,520
like yeah but I know about these two gay
 

4001
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,229
like yeah but I know about these two gay
penguins and so that's natural too and

4002
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
penguins and so that's natural too and
 

4003
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:27,470
penguins and so that's natural too and
so then everyone to draw their their

4004
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:27,480
so then everyone to draw their their
 

4005
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,189
so then everyone to draw their their
identity they're trying to to justify

4006
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:29,199
identity they're trying to to justify
 

4007
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,950
identity they're trying to to justify
their identity off of the the laws of

4008
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:30,960
their identity off of the the laws of
 

4009
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,590
their identity off of the the laws of
nature so the fact that MAA are

4010
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:32,600
nature so the fact that MAA are
 

4011
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,229
nature so the fact that MAA are
monogamous really doesn't have anything

4012
01:14:34,229 --> 01:14:34,239
monogamous really doesn't have anything
 

4013
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:36,350
monogamous really doesn't have anything
to do with anybody except for that it's

4014
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:36,360
to do with anybody except for that it's
 

4015
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,229
to do with anybody except for that it's
beneficial for them to work together to

4016
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:38,239
beneficial for them to work together to
 

4017
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,470
beneficial for them to work together to
raise chicks it's difficult they rely on

4018
01:14:41,470 --> 01:14:41,480
raise chicks it's difficult they rely on
 

4019
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,910
raise chicks it's difficult they rely on
Ironwood trees or AG Gua palms and it's

4020
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:44,920
Ironwood trees or AG Gua palms and it's
 

4021
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:46,590
Ironwood trees or AG Gua palms and it's
difficult to find the right hole in a

4022
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:46,600
difficult to find the right hole in a
 

4023
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,510
difficult to find the right hole in a
tree there's only so much Macau real

4024
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:48,520
tree there's only so much Macau real
 

4025
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,750
tree there's only so much Macau real
estate and so they need to use those

4026
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:50,760
estate and so they need to use those
 

4027
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,709
estate and so they need to use those
holes and each one of those ancient

4028
01:14:53,709 --> 01:14:53,719
holes and each one of those ancient
 

4029
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:55,950
holes and each one of those ancient
trees it's usually 500 100 years or more

4030
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:55,960
trees it's usually 500 100 years or more
 

4031
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,550
trees it's usually 500 100 years or more
is is a is a valuable Maca generating

4032
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,560
is is a is a valuable Maca generating
 

4033
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,669
is is a is a valuable Maca generating
site in the forest and so if those trees

4034
01:15:00,669 --> 01:15:00,679
site in the forest and so if those trees
 

4035
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:04,229
site in the forest and so if those trees
go down you lose exponential amounts of

4036
01:15:04,229 --> 01:15:04,239
go down you lose exponential amounts of
 

4037
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:05,669
go down you lose exponential amounts of
maca and that's how you get endangered

4038
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:05,679
maca and that's how you get endangered
 

4039
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:06,790
maca and that's how you get endangered
species and so that's why we're trying

4040
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800
species and so that's why we're trying
 

4041
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,310
species and so that's why we're trying
to protect the Ironwood

4042
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,320
to protect the Ironwood
 

4043
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:10,870
to protect the Ironwood
trees another ridiculous question tell

4044
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
trees another ridiculous question tell
 

4045
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,870
trees another ridiculous question tell
me if every jungle creature was the same

4046
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:13,880
me if every jungle creature was the same
 

4047
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:16,270
me if every jungle creature was the same
size oh boy who would be the new apex

4048
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:16,280
size oh boy who would be the new apex
 

4049
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,990

4052
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:20,560
food chain dude that's like Super Smash
 

4053
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,310

Brothers of the Jungle that's incredible

4054
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:23,320
Brothers of the Jungle that's incredible
 

4055
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,590
Brothers of the Jungle that's incredible
like bullet ants if you had a bullet ant

4056
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:25,600
like bullet ants if you had a bullet ant
 

4057
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,590
like bullet ants if you had a bullet ant
that was the size yeah can it be like uh

4058
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,600
that was the size yeah can it be like uh
 

4059
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,229
that was the size yeah can it be like uh
like a tournament so everyone is

4060
01:15:31,229 --> 01:15:31,239
like a tournament so everyone is
 

4061
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:33,430
like a tournament so everyone is
pound-for-pound ratioed yeah for

4062
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:33,440
pound-for-pound ratioed yeah for
 

4063
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,910
pound-for-pound ratioed yeah for
efficiency so you have basically like a

4064
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:35,920
efficiency so you have basically like a
 

4065
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,350
efficiency so you have basically like a
six- foot bullet ant versus a a huge

4066
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:38,360
six- foot bullet ant versus a a huge
 

4067
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,070

01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:40,080
black cayman versus an anaconda versus
 

4069
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,270
black cayman versus an anaconda versus
ocelots are the size of jaguars versus

ocelots are the size of jaguars versus
 

4071
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,030
ocelots are the size of jaguars versus
yeah well let's let's go bullet an

4072
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:44,040
yeah well let's let's go bullet an
 

4073
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,430
yeah well let's let's go bullet an
versus black cayman but they're

4074
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:46,440
versus black cayman but they're
 

4075
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,590
versus black cayman but they're
comparable size same

4076
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:48,600
comparable size same
 

4077
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,910
comparable size same
size I don't know man I never thought

4078
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:50,920
size I don't know man I never thought
 

4079
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,590
size I don't know man I never thought
about it I mean bullet an has these

4080
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:52,600
about it I mean bullet an has these
 

4081
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,310
about it I mean bullet an has these
giant giant giant mandibles it could

4082
01:15:55,310 --> 01:15:55,320
giant giant giant mandibles it could
 

4083
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,110
giant giant giant mandibles it could
probably grab the black cayman and then

4084
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:57,120
probably grab the black cayman and then
 

4085
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,669
probably grab the black cayman and then
at that amount of Venom you're talking

4086
01:15:58,669 --> 01:15:58,679
at that amount of Venom you're talking
 

4087
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,550
at that amount of Venom you're talking
about a bucket of Venom going into that

4088
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
about a bucket of Venom going into that
 

4089
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,030
about a bucket of Venom going into that
black cayman black cayman's going to get

4090
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:02,040
black cayman black cayman's going to get
 

4091
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:04,510
black cayman black cayman's going to get
paralyzed immediately well insects have

4092
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:04,520
paralyzed immediately well insects have
 

4093
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:07,030

what the geometry of that is the natural

4098
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
what the geometry of that is the natural
 

4099

it seems like it seems like ants and

4104
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:16,360
it seems like it seems like ants and
 

4105
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:17,950
it seems like it seems like ants and
like just these tiny creatures are the

4106
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:17,960
like just these tiny creatures are the
 

4107
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,149
like just these tiny creatures are the
ones they're able to have that much

what the phys of that like an ant leaf

4112
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:22,360
what the phys of that like an ant leaf
 

4113
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,149
what the phys of that like an ant leaf
cutter ant lifting that leaf that

4114
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
cutter ant lifting that leaf that
 

4115
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,750

4119
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,550

don't know if that's a limit of physics

4120
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:29,560
don't know if that's a limit of physics
 

4121
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:31,030
don't know if that's a limit of physics
I think it's just the limit of evolution

4122
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,040
I think it's just the limit of evolution
 

4123
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,870
I think it's just the limit of evolution
of how that that works one of the most

4124
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:32,880
of how that that works one of the most
 

4125
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,790
of how that that works one of the most
interesting limits that I heard uh

4126
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:34,800
interesting limits that I heard uh
 

4127
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,149
interesting limits that I heard uh
somebody talking about recently was the

4128
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
somebody talking about recently was the
 

4129
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:38,430
somebody talking about recently was the
reason that dinosaurs didn't get bigger

4130
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:38,440
reason that dinosaurs didn't get bigger
 

4131
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,790
reason that dinosaurs didn't get bigger
even bigger because that's the the the

4132
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800
even bigger because that's the the the
 

4133
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,070
even bigger because that's the the the
the the conditions on Earth were

4134
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:42,080
the the conditions on Earth were
 

4135
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,669
the the conditions on Earth were
favorable towards it was that at some

4136
01:16:44,669 --> 01:16:44,679
favorable towards it was that at some
 

4137
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:46,350
favorable towards it was that at some
point their eggs reached there's

4138
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:46,360
point their eggs reached there's
 

4139
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,030
point their eggs reached there's
physical limits that their eggs reached

4140
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:48,040
physical limits that their eggs reached
 

4141
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,189
physical limits that their eggs reached
a size the eggs were so big that that

4142
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:50,199
a size the eggs were so big that that
 

4143
01:16:50,199 --> 01:16:51,910
a size the eggs were so big that that

survive and their eggs reached a limit
where in order to have a shell that

4148
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:55,800
where in order to have a shell that
 

4149
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,790
where in order to have a shell that
could hold the mass of the liquid and

4150
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:57,800
could hold the mass of the liquid and
 

4151
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,229
could hold the mass of the liquid and
and the young dinosaur if they got

4152
01:17:00,229 --> 01:17:00,239
and the young dinosaur if they got
 

4153
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,229
and the young dinosaur if they got
bigger it wouldn't be permeable anymore

4154
01:17:02,229 --> 01:17:02,239
bigger it wouldn't be permeable anymore
 

4155
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:03,590
bigger it wouldn't be permeable anymore
mhm and I thought that was so

4156
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:03,600
mhm and I thought that was so
 

4157
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,390
mhm and I thought that was so
interesting because the entire size of

4158
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:05,400
interesting because the entire size of
 

4159
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,030
interesting because the entire size of
physical creatures was determined by how

4160
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:08,040
physical creatures was determined by how
 

4161
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,790
physical creatures was determined by how
thick shell can be before it breaks or

4162
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:09,800
thick shell can be before it breaks or
 

4163
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:12,550
thick shell can be before it breaks or
before it can't pass air through it yeah

4164
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
before it can't pass air through it yeah
 

4165
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,270
before it can't pass air through it yeah
there might be a lot a lot of the like

4166
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:15,280
there might be a lot a lot of the like
 

4167

reasons but in in the human world is
 

4193
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,470
reasons but in in the human world is
because they seem to be of higher

three Pacos three huge giant vegetarian
piranha and I I just remember touching

4602
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:13,239
piranha and I I just remember touching
 

4603
01:25:13,239 --> 01:25:14,709
piranha and I I just remember touching
them with so much reverence thinking

4604
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:14,719
them with so much reverence thinking
 

4605
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,310
them with so much reverence thinking
about the incredible history and how

4606
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:17,320
about the incredible history and how
 

4607
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,229
about the incredible history and how
that before these Rivers existed those

4608
01:25:19,229 --> 01:25:19,239
that before these Rivers existed those
 

4609
01:25:19,239 --> 01:25:21,830
that before these Rivers existed those
Pacos were were swimming through the

Pacos were were swimming through the
 

4611
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,590
Pacos were were swimming through the
water and and and and trying to survive

we we took just a few and we did it

4618
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:31,880
we we took just a few and we did it
 

4619
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,950
we we took just a few and we did it
respectfully and we did it when we

4620
01:25:33,950 --> 01:25:33,960
respectfully and we did it when we
 

4621
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,109
respectfully and we did it when we
needed it most not at a time when it was

4622
01:25:36,109 --> 01:25:36,119
needed it most not at a time when it was
 

4623
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:37,709
needed it most not at a time when it was
just for fun and it was it was really

4624
01:25:37,709 --> 01:25:37,719
just for fun and it was it was really
 

4625
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:39,790
just for fun and it was it was really
really special well humans using them

4626
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:39,800
really special well humans using them
 

4627
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,270
really special well humans using them
for sustenance there's a collaboration

4628
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:42,280
for sustenance there's a collaboration
 

4629
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,590
for sustenance there's a collaboration
there that's that's something also that

4630
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:44,600
there that's that's something also that
 

4631
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:45,750
there that's that's something also that
I've seen in the jungle that there's

4632
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:45,760
I've seen in the jungle that there's
 

4633
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:48,109
I've seen in the jungle that there's
creatures using each other and it's like

4634
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:48,119
creatures using each other and it's like
 

4635
01:25:48,119 --> 01:25:51,390
creatures using each other and it's like
a dance of either uh mutually using each

4636
01:25:51,390 --> 01:25:51,400
a dance of either uh mutually using each
 

4637
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,709
a dance of either uh mutually using each
other it's or it's parasitic or

4638
01:25:53,709 --> 01:25:53,719
other it's or it's parasitic or
 

4639
01:25:53,719 --> 01:25:55,109
other it's or it's parasitic or
symbiotic

4640
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:55,119
symbiotic
 

4641
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:57,390
symbiotic
it's interesting like there's

4642
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:57,400
it's interesting like there's
 

4643
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:01,310
it's interesting like there's
a uh a medicinal plant you grabbed that

4644
01:26:01,310 --> 01:26:01,320
a uh a medicinal plant you grabbed that
 

4645
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:04,149
a uh a medicinal plant you grabbed that
was full of ants yeah they were like

4646
01:26:04,149 --> 01:26:04,159
was full of ants yeah they were like
 

4647
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,390
was full of ants yeah they were like
trying to uh murder you by

4648
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:06,400
trying to uh murder you by
 

4649
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,669
trying to uh murder you by
biting but they were defending the plant

4650
01:26:08,669 --> 01:26:08,679
biting but they were defending the plant
 

4651
01:26:08,679 --> 01:26:09,910
biting but they were defending the plant
that they were using for whatever

4652
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:09,920
that they were using for whatever
 

4653
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,510
that they were using for whatever
purpose but there's a clear dance there

4654
01:26:12,510 --> 01:26:12,520
purpose but there's a clear dance there
 

4655
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,070
purpose but there's a clear dance there
of the ants using the plant and the

4656
01:26:14,070 --> 01:26:14,080
of the ants using the plant and the
 

4657
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,950
of the ants using the plant and the
plant existing there for other

4658
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:15,960
plant existing there for other
 

4659
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,830
plant existing there for other
applications and other use for humans

4660
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:17,840
applications and other use for humans
 

4661
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,270
applications and other use for humans
and there's that kind of Circle of Life

4662
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:20,280
and there's that kind of Circle of Life
 

4663
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:22,470
and there's that kind of Circle of Life
happening but the ants were defense so

4664
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:22,480
happening but the ants were defense so
 

4665
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,270
happening but the ants were defense so
the the plant didn't have its own

4666
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:24,280
the the plant didn't have its own
 

4667
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:26,870
the the plant didn't have its own
defense mechanism the ants the army of

4668
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:26,880
defense mechanism the ants the army of
 

4669
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,109
defense mechanism the ants the army of
ants was there to protect the plant mhm

4670
01:26:30,109 --> 01:26:30,119
ants was there to protect the plant mhm
 

4671
01:26:30,119 --> 01:26:32,149
ants was there to protect the plant mhm
and did you actually when you remember

4672
01:26:32,149 --> 01:26:32,159
and did you actually when you remember
 

4673
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:33,669
and did you actually when you remember
we put our backpacks down at that one

4674
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:33,679
we put our backpacks down at that one
 

4675
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,790
we put our backpacks down at that one
spot and it was like the ants Scot on

4676
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:35,800
spot and it was like the ants Scot on
 

4677
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:37,310
spot and it was like the ants Scot on
your backpack and I said oh shit this is

4678
01:26:37,310 --> 01:26:37,320
your backpack and I said oh shit this is
 

4679
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,109
your backpack and I said oh shit this is
that tree did you actually get bitten by

4680
01:26:39,109 --> 01:26:39,119
that tree did you actually get bitten by
 

4681
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:40,990
that tree did you actually get bitten by
one of those because they're incredibly

4682
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:41,000
one of those because they're incredibly
 

4683
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,550
one of those because they're incredibly
painful the tongar one they like yeah

4684
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:44,560
painful the tongar one they like yeah
 

4685
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,430
painful the tongar one they like yeah
surprisingly painful cuz they're small

4686
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:46,440
surprisingly painful cuz they're small
 

4687
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:49,030
surprisingly painful cuz they're small
there nothing like um luckily have not

4688
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:49,040
there nothing like um luckily have not
 

4689
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,310
there nothing like um luckily have not
been bitten by a bullet ant yet but it's

4690
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:51,320
been bitten by a bullet ant yet but it's
 

4691
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,189
been bitten by a bullet ant yet but it's
just it's amazing because they live

4692
01:26:53,189 --> 01:26:53,199
just it's amazing because they live
 

4693
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,390
just it's amazing because they live
inside the tree the tree comes standard

4694
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:55,400
inside the tree the tree comes standard
 

4695
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,990
inside the tree the tree comes standard
with holes in it that allow the ants to

4696
01:26:57,990 --> 01:26:58,000
with holes in it that allow the ants to
 

4697
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,270
with holes in it that allow the ants to
to move and to exist safe and it

4698
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:01,280
to move and to exist safe and it
 

4699
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:03,709
to move and to exist safe and it
protects their eggs and they protect the

4700
01:27:03,709 --> 01:27:03,719
protects their eggs and they protect the
 

4701
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:05,390
protects their eggs and they protect the
tree and then so we saw that spot where

4702
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:05,400
tree and then so we saw that spot where
 

4703
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,830
tree and then so we saw that spot where
there's a perfect circle around the

4704
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:06,840
there's a perfect circle around the
 

4705
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,830
there's a perfect circle around the
trees cuz the ants had excavated the

4706
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:10,840
trees cuz the ants had excavated the
 

4707
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,990
trees cuz the ants had excavated the
other vegetation so that those trees

4708
01:27:12,990 --> 01:27:13,000
other vegetation so that those trees
 

4709
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,910
other vegetation so that those trees
could have no competition to grow the

4710
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:15,920
could have no competition to grow the
 

4711
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:20,270
could have no competition to grow the
incredible calculation of how ants know

4712
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:20,280
incredible calculation of how ants know
 

4713
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,030
incredible calculation of how ants know
to gu come programmed to Garden that

4714
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:23,040
to gu come programmed to Garden that
 

4715
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,950
to gu come programmed to Garden that
tree and the tree somehow has been

4716
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:25,960
tree and the tree somehow has been
 

4717
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:28,910
tree and the tree somehow has been
genetically informed to have ant habitat

4718
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:28,920
genetically informed to have ant habitat
 

4719
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:31,189
genetically informed to have ant habitat
within itself it's it's it's

4720
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
within itself it's it's it's
 

4721
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:32,990
within itself it's it's it's
mind-blowing and it actually is the

4722
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:33,000
mind-blowing and it actually is the
 

4723
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,950
mind-blowing and it actually is the
foundation of a lot of existential

4724
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:34,960
foundation of a lot of existential
 

4725
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,229
foundation of a lot of existential
confusion for me because how the hell is

4726
01:27:37,229 --> 01:27:37,239
confusion for me because how the hell is
 

4727
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:40,030
confusion for me because how the hell is
this possible yeah one of the things you

4728
01:27:40,030 --> 01:27:40,040
this possible yeah one of the things you
 

4729
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:43,750
this possible yeah one of the things you
mention that's also a source of a lot of

4730
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:43,760
mention that's also a source of a lot of
 

4731
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,310
mention that's also a source of a lot of
existential confusion for me is ants

4732
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:46,320
existential confusion for me is ants
 

4733
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,910
existential confusion for me is ants
yeah and the intelligence of different

4734
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:47,920
yeah and the intelligence of different
 

4735
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,030
yeah and the intelligence of different
creatures in the forest there's these

4736
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:50,040
creatures in the forest there's these
 

4737
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,030
creatures in the forest there's these
giant colonies there's just giant

4738
01:27:52,030 --> 01:27:52,040
giant colonies there's just giant
 

4739
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,790
giant colonies there's just giant
systems but even just looking at a

4740
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,800
systems but even just looking at a
 

4741
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,149
systems but even just looking at a
single colony of ants them collaborating

4742
01:27:57,149 --> 01:27:57,159
single colony of ants them collaborating
 

4743
01:27:57,159 --> 01:28:00,830
single colony of ants them collaborating
leaf cutter ants is an incredible system

4744
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:00,840
leaf cutter ants is an incredible system
 

4745
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,910
leaf cutter ants is an incredible system
so individually the ants seem kind of

4746
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:02,920
so individually the ants seem kind of
 

4747
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:06,149
so individually the ants seem kind of
dumb and simplistic but taken together

4748
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:06,159
dumb and simplistic but taken together
 

4749
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,910
dumb and simplistic but taken together
there is a vast

4750
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:07,920
there is a vast
 

4751
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,870
there is a vast
intelligence operating that's able to be

4752
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:10,880
intelligence operating that's able to be
 

4753
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,669
intelligence operating that's able to be
robust and resilient in any kind of

4754
01:28:12,669 --> 01:28:12,679
robust and resilient in any kind of
 

4755
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:14,350
robust and resilient in any kind of
conditions is able to figure out a new

4756
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:14,360
conditions is able to figure out a new

there millions of other Earths in our
 

5009
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,750
there millions of other Earths in our
galaxy when you look up you know we were

galaxy when you look up you know we were
 

5011
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,350
galaxy when you look up you know we were
sitting in the Amazon River okay at dark

the storm rolled over and you started
 

5015
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:21,470
the storm rolled over and you started
counting the stars yeah one two and that

counting the stars yeah one two and that
 

5017
01:33:21,480 --> 01:33:23,430
counting the stars yeah one two and that
was once you can count the stars that

5018
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:23,440
was once you can count the stars that
 

5019
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:25,750
was once you can count the stars that
was a that the storm will actually pass

5020

was a that the storm will actually pass
 

5021

eventually will pass and that's what you
 

5023
01:33:27,159 --> 01:33:29,510
eventually will pass and that's what you
doing 3 four five and it's going to pass

5024
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:29,520
doing 3 four five and it's going to pass
 

5025

you're not going to have to sit in that
 

5027
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:33,590
you're not going to have to sit in that
River for like all night so just a

planets around them
 

5035
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,350
planets around them
okay why do you think there's not alien

5036
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:43,360
okay why do you think there's not alien

Hollywood movies you can point up to the
 

5045
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:55,310
Hollywood movies you can point up to the
pieces of light the stars but if you if

5051
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:02,510
that's not from this planet it's still
not possible and so I agree with you

5052
01:34:02,510 --> 01:34:02,520
not possible and so I agree with you
 

5053
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:03,950
not possible and so I agree with you
that the likelihood is there all

01:34:16,239 --> 01:34:18,470
just a a planet of butterflies whatever
you know something else that would be

5068
01:34:18,470 --> 01:34:18,480
you know something else that would be
 

5069
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:20,270
you know something else that would be
amazing but

5070
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:20,280
amazing but
 

5071
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,750
amazing but
but I'm concerned with the reality that

5072
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:22,760
but I'm concerned with the reality that
 

5073
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:24,109
but I'm concerned with the reality that
we have in front of us is that that this

5074
01:34:24,109 --> 01:34:24,119
we have in front of us is that that this
 

5075
01:34:24,119 --> 01:34:26,790
we have in front of us is that that this
is the spaceship this is life yeah and

5076
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:26,800
is the spaceship this is life yeah and
 

5077
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:28,870
is the spaceship this is life yeah and
so right now given that reality maybe

5078
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:28,880
so right now given that reality maybe
 

5079
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,950
so right now given that reality maybe
that's maybe that's the case maybe maybe

5080
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:30,960
that's maybe that's the case maybe maybe
 

5081
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:32,910
that's maybe that's the case maybe maybe
there are other

5082
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:32,920
there are other
 

5083
01:34:32,920 --> 01:34:34,950
there are other
planets

5084
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:34,960
planets
 

5085
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,310
planets
or or maybe we are the first maybe life

5086
01:34:39,310 --> 01:34:39,320
or or maybe we are the first maybe life
 

5087
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:43,109
or or maybe we are the first maybe life
originated here maybe God the universe

5088
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:43,119
originated here maybe God the universe
 

5089
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:46,350
originated here maybe God the universe
whatever maybe maybe this is it this is

5090
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:46,360
whatever maybe maybe this is it this is
 

5091
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,149
whatever maybe maybe this is it this is
the this is the this is the the testing

5092
01:34:49,149 --> 01:34:49,159
the this is the this is the the testing
 

5093
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:52,030
the this is the this is the the testing
ground for something bigger and and and

5094
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:52,040
ground for something bigger and and and
 

5095
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:54,550
ground for something bigger and and and
and this complexity and this div of life

5096
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:54,560
and this complexity and this div of life
 

5097
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,270
and this complexity and this div of life
and this life that we have is that

5098
01:34:57,270 --> 01:34:57,280
and this life that we have is that
 

5099
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,950
and this life that we have is that
important and I think that part of what

5100
01:34:58,950 --> 01:34:58,960
important and I think that part of what
 

5101
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,470
important and I think that part of what
we do when we go oh yeah but there's

5102
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:00,480
we do when we go oh yeah but there's
 

5103
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,629
we do when we go oh yeah but there's
other planets where first of all we're

5104
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
other planets where first of all we're
 

5105
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,709
other planets where first of all we're
we're we're taking an assumption into

5106
01:35:05,709 --> 01:35:05,719
we're we're taking an assumption into
 

5107
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:08,470
we're we're taking an assumption into
reality without I mean you know aliens

5108
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:08,480
reality without I mean you know aliens
 

5109
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,870
reality without I mean you know aliens
right now are about as real as Santa

5110
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:09,880
right now are about as real as Santa
 

5111
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,550
right now are about as real as Santa
Claus we think they're out there but

5112
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:11,560
Claus we think they're out there but
 

5113
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:12,870
Claus we think they're out there but
we're not sure maybe they're a little

5114
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:12,880
we're not sure maybe they're a little
 

5115
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:14,430
we're not sure maybe they're a little
more real because you know it could make

5116
01:35:14,430 --> 01:35:14,440
more real because you know it could make
 

5117
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:17,109
more real because you know it could make
sense we no one has an alien no one's

5118
01:35:17,109 --> 01:35:17,119
sense we no one has an alien no one's
 

5119
01:35:17,119 --> 01:35:18,750
sense we no one has an alien no one's
seen an alien no one's even seen

5120
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:18,760
seen an alien no one's even seen
 

5121
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,830
seen an alien no one's even seen
cellular life and so I'm not again if

5122
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:21,840
cellular life and so I'm not again if
 

5123
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,109
cellular life and so I'm not again if
they showed up tomorrow great let's

5124
01:35:23,109 --> 01:35:23,119
they showed up tomorrow great let's
 

5125
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:26,510
they showed up tomorrow great let's
study them but but right now we have

5126
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:26,520
study them but but right now we have
 

5127
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,510
study them but but right now we have
this very simple threat going on where

5128
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
this very simple threat going on where
 

5129
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,790
this very simple threat going on where
we can't stop killing each other and our

5130
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:31,800
we can't stop killing each other and our
 

5131
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:32,629
we can't stop killing each other and our
living

5132
01:35:32,629 --> 01:35:32,639
living
 

5133
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:34,790
living
environment and so while some people can

5134
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:34,800
environment and so while some people can
 

5135
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,510
environment and so while some people can
specialize in looking to the stars and

5136
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:36,520
specialize in looking to the stars and
 

5137
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:38,109
specialize in looking to the stars and
to other planets and talk about being an

5138
01:35:38,109 --> 01:35:38,119
to other planets and talk about being an
 

5139
01:35:38,119 --> 01:35:40,950
to other planets and talk about being an
interplanetary species I'm very much

5140
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:40,960
interplanetary species I'm very much
 

5141
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,350
interplanetary species I'm very much
concerned with the fact that here in our

5142
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:43,360
concerned with the fact that here in our
 

5143
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,709
concerned with the fact that here in our
home turf our living environment where

5144
01:35:45,709 --> 01:35:45,719
home turf our living environment where
 

5145
01:35:45,719 --> 01:35:47,990
home turf our living environment where
the air is good and the rivers are clean

5146
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,000
the air is good and the rivers are clean
 

5147
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,109
the air is good and the rivers are clean
and the trees are big and there's Maca

5148
01:35:50,109 --> 01:35:50,119
and the trees are big and there's Maca
 

5149
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,590
and the trees are big and there's Maca
flying through the sky and salmon in the

5150
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:52,600
flying through the sky and salmon in the
 

5151
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:54,270
flying through the sky and salmon in the
rivers

5152
01:35:54,270 --> 01:35:54,280
rivers
 

5153
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:56,629
rivers
not only do we have a responsibility to

5154
01:35:56,629 --> 01:35:56,639
not only do we have a responsibility to
 

5155
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,430
not only do we have a responsibility to
each other and to our children to

5156
01:35:58,430 --> 01:35:58,440
each other and to our children to
 

5157
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,070
each other and to our children to
protect this incredible gift that is our

01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:01,080
protect this incredible gift that is our

01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:04,360
entire reality seems kind of weird to at

01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:07,030
entire reality seems kind of weird to at
some point it conservation seems kind of

5162
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:07,040
some point it conservation seems kind of
 

5163
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:09,030
some point it conservation seems kind of
ridiculous like you're begging people to

5164
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,040
ridiculous like you're begging people to
 

5165
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,629
ridiculous like you're begging people to
not pollute the things that keep them

5166
01:36:10,629 --> 01:36:10,639
not pollute the things that keep them
 

5167
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,750
not pollute the things that keep them
alive it's it's it's almost kind of

silly at a
 

5171
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,950
silly at a
point but but we have this incredible

5172
01:36:17,950 --> 01:36:17,960
point but but we have this incredible
 

5173
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,430
point but but we have this incredible
thing where there are fish in the ocean

5174
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:19,440
thing where there are fish in the ocean
 

5175
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,990
thing where there are fish in the ocean
and in the rivers they come standard

5176
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:21,000
and in the rivers they come standard

with life on Earth and and we're we're
 

5179
01:36:23,159 --> 01:36:24,870
with life on Earth and and we're we're
we're harming the ability of Earth's

5180
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:24,880
we're harming the ability of Earth's
 

5181
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,350
we're harming the ability of Earth's
ecosystems to provide for that life and

5182
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
ecosystems to provide for that life and
 

5183
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,750
ecosystems to provide for that life and
we are the generation that's going to

we are the generation that's going to

we are the generation that's going to

provide life to all the people on Earth

ERS you not everything can be seen from

5202
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:50,880
ERS you not everything can be seen from

a human perspective these are other

so I'm I'm more biocentric than
 

5209
01:36:58,040 --> 01:37:00,030
so I'm I'm more biocentric than
anthropocentric and that I I I think

01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:00,040
anthropocentric and that I I I think
 

5211
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:02,470
anthropocentric and that I I I think
that that nature is important but I also

5212
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:02,480
that that nature is important but I also
 

5213
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:05,950
that that nature is important but I also
believe that we

5214

5215
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,910

are we are special we are the most

are we are special we are the most
intelligent animal so one I I agree with

you there's some degree to which when

you there's some degree to which when
you imagine

advanced than humans they're far more
advanced than any life forms on Earth so

5380
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:38,440
advanced than any life forms on Earth so
 

5381
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:40,390
advanced than any life forms on Earth so
they're even if it's just their

5382
01:40:40,390 --> 01:40:40,400
they're even if it's just their
 

5383
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:44,310
they're even if it's just their
probes we cannot just even comprehend it

5384
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:44,320
probes we cannot just even comprehend it
 

5385
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,629
probes we cannot just even comprehend it
I think it's possible

5386
01:40:46,629 --> 01:40:46,639
I think it's possible
 

5387
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:49,510
I think it's possible
that they operate in the space of ideas

5388
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,520
that they operate in the space of ideas
 

5389
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,990
that they operate in the space of ideas
for example that ideas could be aliens

5390
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:52,000
for example that ideas could be aliens
 

5391
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,910
for example that ideas could be aliens
feelings could be aliens Consciousness

5392
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:53,920
feelings could be aliens Consciousness
 

5393
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,870
feelings could be aliens Consciousness
itself could be aliens so we can't

5394
01:40:56,870 --> 01:40:56,880
itself could be aliens so we can't
 

5395
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,430
itself could be aliens so we can't
restrict our understanding what is a

5396
01:40:59,430 --> 01:40:59,440
restrict our understanding what is a
 

5397
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:02,390
restrict our understanding what is a
life form to a thing that is a

5398
01:41:02,390 --> 01:41:02,400
life form to a thing that is a
 

5399
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:05,270
life form to a thing that is a
biological creature that operates via

5400
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:05,280
biological creature that operates via
 

5401
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,030
biological creature that operates via
natural selection on this particular

5402
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:07,040
natural selection on this particular
 

5403
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,430
natural selection on this particular
Planet it could be much much much more

5404
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
Planet it could be much much much more
 

5405
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,189
Planet it could be much much much more
sophisticated it could be in a space of

5406
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:11,199
sophisticated it could be in a space of
 

5407
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:13,350
sophisticated it could be in a space of
computation for example as we in the

5408
01:41:13,350 --> 01:41:13,360
computation for example as we in the
 

5409
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,270
computation for example as we in the
21st century are developing increasingly

5410
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:16,280
21st century are developing increasingly
 

5411
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,310
21st century are developing increasingly
sophisticated computational systems with

5412
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,320
sophisticated computational systems with
 

5413
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,709
sophisticated computational systems with
artificial intelligence it could be

5414
01:41:19,709 --> 01:41:19,719
artificial intelligence it could be
 

5415
01:41:19,719 --> 01:41:21,750
artificial intelligence it could be
operating on some other level that we

5416
01:41:21,750 --> 01:41:21,760
operating on some other level that we
 

5417
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,910
operating on some other level that we
can't even imagine it could be operating

5418
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:23,920
can't even imagine it could be operating
 

5419
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,669
can't even imagine it could be operating
on a level of physics that we have not

5420
01:41:25,669 --> 01:41:25,679
on a level of physics that we have not
 

5421
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:27,310
on a level of physics that we have not
even begun to

5422
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:27,320
even begun to
 

5423
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:30,470
even begun to
understand uh we we barely understand

5424
01:41:30,470 --> 01:41:30,480
understand uh we we barely understand
 

5425
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:33,030
understand uh we we barely understand
quantum mechanics we use it quantum

5426
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,040
quantum mechanics we use it quantum
 

5427
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,470
quantum mechanics we use it quantum
mechanics is a way we use to make very

5428
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:35,480
mechanics is a way we use to make very
 

5429
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:38,430
mechanics is a way we use to make very
accurate predictions but to understand

5430
01:41:38,430 --> 01:41:38,440
accurate predictions but to understand
 

5431
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:41,589
accurate predictions but to understand
why it's operating that way we don't and

5432
01:41:41,589 --> 01:41:41,599
why it's operating that way we don't and
 

5433
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:45,270
why it's operating that way we don't and
there's so many gigantic powerful Cosmic

5434
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:45,280
there's so many gigantic powerful Cosmic
 

5435
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,709
there's so many gigantic powerful Cosmic
entities out there that we

5436
01:41:48,709 --> 01:41:48,719
entities out there that we
 

5437
01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:50,709
entities out there that we
detect sometimes can't detect Dark

5438
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
detect sometimes can't detect Dark
 

5439
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:53,870
detect sometimes can't detect Dark
Matter Dark Energy but it's out there we

5440
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:53,880
Matter Dark Energy but it's out there we
 

5441
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:57,229
Matter Dark Energy but it's out there we
know it exists but we can't explain why

5442
01:41:57,229 --> 01:41:57,239
know it exists but we can't explain why
 

5443
01:41:57,239 --> 01:42:00,350
know it exists but we can't explain why
and what the fuck it is we give it names

5444
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:00,360
and what the fuck it is we give it names
 

5445
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:03,629
and what the fuck it is we give it names
black holes and dark energy and dark

5446
01:42:03,629 --> 01:42:03,639
black holes and dark energy and dark
 

5447
01:42:03,639 --> 01:42:06,629
black holes and dark energy and dark
matter but those are all names for

5448
01:42:06,629 --> 01:42:06,639
matter but those are all names for
 

5449
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:08,669
matter but those are all names for
things that mathematical equations

5450
01:42:08,669 --> 01:42:08,679
things that mathematical equations
 

5451
01:42:08,679 --> 01:42:11,790
things that mathematical equations
predict but we don't understand and

5452
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:11,800
predict but we don't understand and
 

5453
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:14,910
predict but we don't understand and
so all of that is just to say that

5454
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:14,920
so all of that is just to say that
 

5455
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:17,750
so all of that is just to say that
aliens could be here in ways that are

5456
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:17,760
aliens could be here in ways that are
 

5457
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,189
aliens could be here in ways that are
for now and maybe for a long time going

5458
01:42:20,189 --> 01:42:20,199
for now and maybe for a long time going
 

5459
01:42:20,199 --> 01:42:22,030
for now and maybe for a long time going
to be impossible for humans to

5460
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:22,040
to be impossible for humans to
 

5461
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,109
to be impossible for humans to
understand so aliens in the in the

5462
01:42:24,109 --> 01:42:24,119
understand so aliens in the in the
 

5463
01:42:24,119 --> 01:42:26,430
understand so aliens in the in the
strict biological sense like like like

5464
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:26,440
strict biological sense like like like
 

5465
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:28,870
strict biological sense like like like
like horseshoe

5466
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:28,880
like horseshoe
 

5467
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:31,270
like horseshoe
crabs we agree that they're they're not

5468
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:31,280
crabs we agree that they're they're not
 

5469
01:42:31,280 --> 01:42:34,189
crabs we agree that they're they're not
we haven't found physical aliens the

5470
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:34,199
we haven't found physical aliens the
 

5471
01:42:34,199 --> 01:42:36,310
we haven't found physical aliens the
only way I can imagine finding physical

5472
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,320
only way I can imagine finding physical
 

5473
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,830
only way I can imagine finding physical
aliens is if alien species are trying to

5474
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:39,840
aliens is if alien species are trying to
 

5475
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,629
aliens is if alien species are trying to
communicate with us humans uh or with

5476
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:42,639
communicate with us humans uh or with
 

5477
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:44,950
communicate with us humans uh or with
other life forms and are trying to

5478
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:44,960
other life forms and are trying to
 

5479
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:47,589
other life forms and are trying to
figure out a way to communicate with us

5480
01:42:47,589 --> 01:42:47,599
figure out a way to communicate with us
 

5481
01:42:47,599 --> 01:42:50,310
figure out a way to communicate with us
such that we dumb humans would

5482
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:50,320
such that we dumb humans would
 

5483
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:54,510
such that we dumb humans would
understand like let's create a thing

5484
01:42:54,510 --> 01:42:54,520
understand like let's create a thing
 

5485
01:42:54,520 --> 01:42:57,070
understand like let's create a thing
yo there's a

5486
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:57,080
yo there's a
 

5487
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:01,229
yo there's a
moth the size of a small Eagle that's

5488
01:43:01,229 --> 01:43:01,239
moth the size of a small Eagle that's
 

5489
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:03,629
moth the size of a small Eagle that's
try to get us 15 minutes of ATT it just

5490
01:43:03,629 --> 01:43:03,639
try to get us 15 minutes of ATT it just
 

5491
01:43:03,639 --> 01:43:05,350
try to get us 15 minutes of ATT it just
might it just might um big fan of the

5492
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:05,360
might it just might um big fan of the
 

5493
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:09,750
might it just might um big fan of the
podcast okay Lex I love you um all right

5494
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:09,760
podcast okay Lex I love you um all right
 

5495
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:11,109
podcast okay Lex I love you um all right
so so what your wouldn't it be

5496
01:43:11,109 --> 01:43:11,119
so so what your wouldn't it be
 

5497
01:43:11,119 --> 01:43:12,149
so so what your wouldn't it be
interesting it would be really

5498
01:43:12,149 --> 01:43:12,159
interesting it would be really
 

5499
01:43:12,159 --> 01:43:14,470
interesting it would be really
fascinating to me if we found out that

5500
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:14,480
fascinating to me if we found out that
 

5501
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,430
fascinating to me if we found out that
there were aliens living among us and we

5502
01:43:16,430 --> 01:43:16,440
there were aliens living among us and we
 

5503
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:19,470
there were aliens living among us and we
couldn't see them and what some of the

5504
01:43:19,470 --> 01:43:19,480
couldn't see them and what some of the
 

5505
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:21,470
couldn't see them and what some of the
people were calling aliens the

5506
01:43:21,470 --> 01:43:21,480
people were calling aliens the
 

5507
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,629
people were calling aliens the
scientists the the religious people were

5508
01:43:23,629 --> 01:43:23,639
scientists the the religious people were
 

5509
01:43:23,639 --> 01:43:25,550
scientists the the religious people were
calling angels and then everybody had

5510
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:25,560
calling angels and then everybody had
 

5511
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:26,910
calling angels and then everybody had
this realization that whether you call

5512
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:26,920
this realization that whether you call
 

5513
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,629
this realization that whether you call
them aliens or Angels there are these

5514
01:43:29,629 --> 01:43:29,639
them aliens or Angels there are these
 

5515
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:31,750
them aliens or Angels there are these
other there is more way more to the

5516
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:31,760
other there is more way more to the
 

5517
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:37,550
other there is more way more to the
universe than we're realizing I just for

5518
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:37,560

 

5519
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:40,870

me the fact that there's there's a skull

5520
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:40,880
me the fact that there's there's a skull
 

5521
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,229
me the fact that there's there's a skull
on the table yeah there's a skull the

5522
01:43:43,229 --> 01:43:43,239
on the table yeah there's a skull the
 

5523
01:43:43,239 --> 01:43:45,189
on the table yeah there's a skull the
table there a skull in your hand there's

5524
01:43:45,189 --> 01:43:45,199
table there a skull in your hand there's
 

5525
01:43:45,199 --> 01:43:47,109
table there a skull in your hand there's
now a skull in my hand of a monkey with

5526
01:43:47,109 --> 01:43:47,119
now a skull in my hand of a monkey with
 

5527
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:49,950
now a skull in my hand of a monkey with
a bullet in its head that I found on the

5528
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:49,960
a bullet in its head that I found on the
 

5529
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:51,910
a bullet in its head that I found on the
floor of an indigenous Community where

5530
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:51,920
floor of an indigenous Community where
 

5531
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,350
floor of an indigenous Community where
they eat monkeys I didn't kill the

5532
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:53,360
they eat monkeys I didn't kill the
 

5533
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:57,510
they eat monkeys I didn't kill the
monkey so save your comments but you

5534
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:57,520
monkey so save your comments but you
 

5535
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:01,149
monkey so save your comments but you

5541
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,910
feeling and I'm not requiring anybody
else to have this feeling but because we

know that there's life and we have no
 

5547
01:44:11,560 --> 01:44:14,470
know that there's life and we have no
idea how it

5548
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:14,480

 

5549
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,229

started I just think it's so important

5550
01:44:17,229 --> 01:44:17,239
started I just think it's so important
 

5551
01:44:17,239 --> 01:44:20,589
started I just think it's so important
to protect it and and and for me it's

5552
01:44:20,589 --> 01:44:20,599
to protect it and and and for me it's
 

5553
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:22,310
to protect it and and and for me it's
just as much about our children as it is

5554
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:22,320
just as much about our children as it is
 

5555
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,910
just as much about our children as it is
about the little SP SP monkeys and the

5556
01:44:23,910 --> 01:44:23,920
about the little SP SP monkeys and the
 

5557
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:25,470
about the little SP SP monkeys and the
little baby Cayman that are in the river

little baby Cayman that are in the river
 

5559
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:28,550

yeah and I think that there's a huge

5562
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:30,960
yeah and I think that there's a huge
 

5563
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,350
yeah and I think that there's a huge
amount of intellectual responsibility

5564
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
amount of intellectual responsibility
 

5565
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,270
amount of intellectual responsibility
that we

5566
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:35,280
that we
 

5567
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:39,830
that we
can transfer off of ourselves if we go

5568
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:39,840
can transfer off of ourselves if we go
 

5569
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,310
can transfer off of ourselves if we go
yeah the rivers are filled with trash

5570
01:44:41,310 --> 01:44:41,320
yeah the rivers are filled with trash
 

5571
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:43,550
yeah the rivers are filled with trash
and yeah Extinction is happening but we

5572
01:44:43,550 --> 01:44:43,560
and yeah Extinction is happening but we
 

5573
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,229
and yeah Extinction is happening but we
have to be an interplanetary species

5574
01:44:45,229 --> 01:44:45,239
have to be an interplanetary species
 

5575
01:44:45,239 --> 01:44:47,149
have to be an interplanetary species
anyway because at any moment this could

5576
01:44:47,149 --> 01:44:47,159
anyway because at any moment this could
 

5577
01:44:47,159 --> 01:44:48,669
anyway because at any moment this could
all end from an asteroid and like

5578
01:44:48,669 --> 01:44:48,679
all end from an asteroid and like
 

5579
01:44:48,679 --> 01:44:50,270
all end from an asteroid and like
everything's going to shit anyway and so

5580
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:50,280
everything's going to shit anyway and so
 

5581
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:51,750
everything's going to shit anyway and so
it's like we're fucking up this planet

again there's so much
incredible opportunity that technology

5610
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:21,000
incredible opportunity that technology
 

5611
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,310
incredible opportunity that technology
has allowed us to do and we're the we're

5612
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320
has allowed us to do and we're the we're
 

5613

has allowed us to do and we're the we're
the richest in hist I mean we could do

5614
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:24,000
the richest in hist I mean we could do
 

5615
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,109
the richest in hist I mean we could do
everything we could cross the whole

everything we could cross the whole
 

5617
01:45:26,119 --> 01:45:27,470
everything we could cross the whole
planet in a second and it's like that's

5618
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:27,480
planet in a second and it's like that's
 

5619
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,470
planet in a second and it's like that's
an amazing time to be alive and if we

5620
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:29,480
an amazing time to be alive and if we
 

5621
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,470
an amazing time to be alive and if we
just don't fuck up the ecosystems and

5622
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:31,480
just don't fuck up the ecosystems and
 

5623
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:34,070
just don't fuck up the ecosystems and
kill all the other animals we got it

5624
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:34,080
kill all the other animals we got it
 

5625
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:36,709
kill all the other animals we got it
made yeah so it is true that we can

5626
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:36,719
made yeah so it is true that we can
 

5627
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:38,750
made yeah so it is true that we can
destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons

5628
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:38,760
destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons
 

5629
01:45:38,760 --> 01:45:41,430
destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons
but it also is true that that snake that

5630
01:45:41,430 --> 01:45:41,440
but it also is true that that snake that
 

5631
01:45:41,440 --> 01:45:44,350
but it also is true that that snake that
I got to handle yesterday is like one of

5632
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:44,360
I got to handle yesterday is like one of
 

5633
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:47,350
I got to handle yesterday is like one of
the most beautiful things Earth has ever

5634
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:47,360
the most beautiful things Earth has ever
 

5635
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,870
the most beautiful things Earth has ever
created in in that little organism is

5636
01:45:49,870 --> 01:45:49,880
created in in that little organism is
 

5637
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:52,189
created in in that little organism is
encapsulated the entire history of Earth

5638
01:45:52,189 --> 01:45:52,199
encapsulated the entire history of Earth
 

5639
01:45:52,199 --> 01:45:54,750
encapsulated the entire history of Earth
and it's it's beautiful so we both

5640
01:45:54,750 --> 01:45:54,760
and it's it's beautiful so we both
 

5641
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:57,030
and it's it's beautiful so we both
things are true we should we should

5642
01:45:57,030 --> 01:45:57,040
things are true we should we should
 

5643
01:45:57,040 --> 01:45:59,109
things are true we should we should
worry about the existential destruction

5644
01:45:59,109 --> 01:45:59,119
worry about the existential destruction
 

5645
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:00,589
worry about the existential destruction
of human civilization through the

5646
01:46:00,589 --> 01:46:00,599
of human civilization through the
 

5647
01:46:00,599 --> 01:46:03,830
of human civilization through the
weapons we create and we should become

5648
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:03,840
weapons we create and we should become
 

5649
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:06,550
weapons we create and we should become
multiplanetary species as a backup for

5650
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:06,560
multiplanetary species as a backup for
 

5651
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:09,550
multiplanetary species as a backup for
that purpose but also remember that this

5652
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:09,560
that purpose but also remember that this
 

5653
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:12,830
that purpose but also remember that this
place is is really really special and

5654
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:12,840
place is is really really special and
 

5655
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:14,709
place is is really really special and
probably if not difficult probably

5656
01:46:14,709 --> 01:46:14,719
probably if not difficult probably
 

5657
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:17,149
probably if not difficult probably
impossible to recreate

5658
01:46:17,149 --> 01:46:17,159
impossible to recreate
 

5659
01:46:17,159 --> 01:46:19,350
impossible to recreate
elsewhere and by the way there's

5660
01:46:19,350 --> 01:46:19,360
elsewhere and by the way there's
 

5661
01:46:19,360 --> 01:46:21,950
elsewhere and by the way there's
something incredibly powerful about a

5662
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:21,960
something incredibly powerful about a
 

5663
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,790
something incredibly powerful about a
skull yeah

5664
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:23,800

raised us sibling species that we we've
 

5863
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:30,350
raised us sibling species that we we've
been we've inhabited the same Epoch in

5864
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:30,360
been we've inhabited the same Epoch in
 

5865
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:33,109
been we've inhabited the same Epoch in

dragged itself away on its front legs
 

6083
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:34,109

these things I mean the most magical
thing and I've spoken about this many

6100
01:54:53,229 --> 01:54:53,239
thing and I've spoken about this many
 

6101
01:54:53,239 --> 01:54:55,109
thing and I've spoken about this many
times was that I was walking with a herd

6102
01:54:55,109 --> 01:54:55,119
times was that I was walking with a herd
 

6103
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:56,750
times was that I was walking with a herd
of semi- wild elephants that were

6104
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:56,760
of semi- wild elephants that were
 

6105
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,589
of semi- wild elephants that were
crossing through a village in India

6106
01:54:58,589 --> 01:54:58,599
crossing through a village in India
 

6107
01:54:58,599 --> 01:55:00,750
crossing through a village in India
because elephants have lost a lot of

6108
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:00,760
because elephants have lost a lot of
 

6109
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,990
because elephants have lost a lot of
their territory because there's so much

6110
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:03,000
their territory because there's so much
 

6111
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,430
their territory because there's so much
so so much population in India and so

6112
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:05,440
so so much population in India and so

01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:50,950
an elephant is not the same as what's
right and wrong for Grizzly Bear Grizzly

6310
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:50,960
right and wrong for Grizzly Bear Grizzly
 

6311
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,990
right and wrong for Grizzly Bear Grizzly
Bear if you're male grizzly bear and you

6312
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:53,000
Bear if you're male grizzly bear and you
 

6313
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,470
Bear if you're male grizzly bear and you
see a female with Cubs you just kill

6314
01:58:55,470 --> 01:58:55,480
see a female with Cubs you just kill
 

6315
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:56,750
see a female with Cubs you just kill
those Cubs and then you can mate with

6316
01:58:56,750 --> 01:58:56,760
those Cubs and then you can mate with
 

6317
01:58:56,760 --> 01:58:58,350
those Cubs and then you can mate with
that you can mate with her and put your

6318
01:58:58,350 --> 01:58:58,360
that you can mate with her and put your
 

6319
01:58:58,360 --> 01:58:59,790
that you can mate with her and put your
own Cubs in there and it's like that's a

6320
01:58:59,790 --> 01:58:59,800
own Cubs in there and it's like that's a
 

6321
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,950
own Cubs in there and it's like that's a
whole different type of Ethics yeah the

6322
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:02,960
whole different type of Ethics yeah the
 

6323
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:06,950
whole different type of Ethics yeah the
value of uh child life is different from

6324
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:06,960
value of uh child life is different from
 

6325
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,109
value of uh child life is different from
species to species some of them hold is

6326
01:59:09,109 --> 01:59:09,119
species to species some of them hold is
 

6327
01:59:09,119 --> 01:59:10,990
species to species some of them hold is
sacred some of them not at all and

6328
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:11,000
sacred some of them not at all and
 

6329
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,589
sacred some of them not at all and
that's why I think I I resonate so much

6330
01:59:12,589 --> 01:59:12,599
that's why I think I I resonate so much
 

6331
01:59:12,599 --> 01:59:14,149
that's why I think I I resonate so much
with elephants because they're I think

6332
01:59:14,149 --> 01:59:14,159
with elephants because they're I think
 

6333
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:16,069
with elephants because they're I think
they're M I think that we're we're we

6334
01:59:16,069 --> 01:59:16,079
they're M I think that we're we're we
 

6335
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:17,910
they're M I think that we're we're we
are kind of matriarchal at least I grew

6336
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:17,920
are kind of matriarchal at least I grew
 

6337
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:20,510
are kind of matriarchal at least I grew
up matriarchal like women were the force

6338
01:59:20,510 --> 01:59:20,520
up matriarchal like women were the force
 

6339
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:23,470
up matriarchal like women were the force
in my life um my family and most of my

6340
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:23,480
in my life um my family and most of my
 

6341
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:25,229
in my life um my family and most of my
friends's family women kind of have the

6342
01:59:25,229 --> 01:59:25,239
friends's family women kind of have the
 

6343
01:59:25,239 --> 01:59:28,310
friends's family women kind of have the
final say and uh I feel like that's the

6344
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,320
final say and uh I feel like that's the
 

6345
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,830
final say and uh I feel like that's the
way it is with with with with elephants

6346
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:30,840
way it is with with with with elephants
 

6347
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:32,270
way it is with with with with elephants
like you might be bigger and stronger

6348
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:32,280
like you might be bigger and stronger
 

6349
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:33,510
like you might be bigger and stronger
but it doesn't really account for much

6350
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:33,520
but it doesn't really account for much
 

6351
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,470
but it doesn't really account for much
if you're not smarter and and more

6352
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:35,480
if you're not smarter and and more
 

6353
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:37,430
if you're not smarter and and more
emotionally intelligent and you know how

6354
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:37,440
emotionally intelligent and you know how
 

6355
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,709
emotionally intelligent and you know how
to take care of the

6356
01:59:39,709 --> 01:59:39,719
to take care of the
 

6357
01:59:39,719 --> 01:59:42,229
to take care of the
group just to zoom out into the

6358
01:59:42,229 --> 01:59:42,239
group just to zoom out into the
 

6359
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:45,030
group just to zoom out into the
ridiculous questions as we were talking

6360
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,040
ridiculous questions as we were talking
 

6361
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:48,430
ridiculous questions as we were talking
about aliens there's uh a lot of people

6362
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:48,440
about aliens there's uh a lot of people
 

6363
01:59:48,440 --> 01:59:50,510
about aliens there's uh a lot of people
trying to understand trying to study the

6364
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:50,520
trying to understand trying to study the
 

6365
01:59:50,520 --> 01:59:53,229
trying to understand trying to study the
origin of life oh I love this first of

6366
01:59:53,229 --> 01:59:53,239
origin of life oh I love this first of
 

6367
01:59:53,239 --> 01:59:57,870
origin of life oh I love this first of
all what do you think is life versus

6368
01:59:57,870 --> 01:59:57,880
all what do you think is life versus
 

6369
01:59:57,880 --> 02:00:00,950
all what do you think is life versus
non-life like when you look at like ants

6370
02:00:00,950 --> 02:00:00,960
non-life like when you look at like ants
 

6371
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:03,470
non-life like when you look at like ants
or even like the simplest simplest of

6372
02:00:03,470 --> 02:00:03,480
or even like the simplest simplest of
 

6373
02:00:03,480 --> 02:00:05,870
or even like the simplest simplest of
organisms we saw a frog in the Stream

6374
02:00:05,870 --> 02:00:05,880
organisms we saw a frog in the Stream
 

6375
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,830
organisms we saw a frog in the Stream
yesterday that was like a leaf frog it

6376
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:07,840
yesterday that was like a leaf frog it
 

6377
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:11,189
yesterday that was like a leaf frog it
was like as flat as a sheet of paper and

6378
02:00:11,189 --> 02:00:11,199
was like as flat as a sheet of paper and
 

6379
02:00:11,199 --> 02:00:13,430
was like as flat as a sheet of paper and
it does a lot of weird

6380
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:13,440
it does a lot of weird
 

6381
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:16,550
it does a lot of weird
things and it found a way to exist in

6382
02:00:16,550 --> 02:00:16,560
things and it found a way to exist in
 

6383
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:19,149
things and it found a way to exist in
this world but that's a single living

6384
02:00:19,149 --> 02:00:19,159
this world but that's a single living
 

6385
02:00:19,159 --> 02:00:21,109
this world but that's a single living
organisms with a bunch of components to

6386
02:00:21,109 --> 02:00:21,119
organisms with a bunch of components to
 

6387
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:24,790
organisms with a bunch of components to
but like there a life form that exists

6388
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:24,800
but like there a life form that exists
 

6389
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,589
but like there a life form that exists
in this world what is the difference

6390
02:00:26,589 --> 02:00:26,599
in this world what is the difference
 

6391
02:00:26,599 --> 02:00:29,270
in this world what is the difference
between that and a rock what what is

6392
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:29,280
between that and a rock what what is
 

6393
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:32,229
between that and a rock what what is
like what is the essence of that life

6394
02:00:32,229 --> 02:00:32,239
like what is the essence of that life
 

6395
02:00:32,239 --> 02:00:34,149
like what is the essence of that life
this might be an unanswerable question

6396
02:00:34,149 --> 02:00:34,159
this might be an unanswerable question
 

6397
02:00:34,159 --> 02:00:35,870
this might be an unanswerable question
there's probably a chemistry physics

6398
02:00:35,870 --> 02:00:35,880
there's probably a chemistry physics
 

6399
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:38,510
there's probably a chemistry physics
biology way of answering that like what

6400
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:38,520
biology way of answering that like what
 

6401
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:43,109
biology way of answering that like what
to you is that I I I think to me life is

6402
02:00:43,109 --> 02:00:43,119
to you is that I I I think to me life is
 

6403
02:00:43,119 --> 02:00:44,589
to you is that I I I think to me life is
something that grows in responds to

6404
02:00:44,589 --> 02:00:44,599
something that grows in responds to
 

6405
02:00:44,599 --> 02:00:47,470
something that grows in responds to
stimuli like in basic biology 101 I

6406
02:00:47,470 --> 02:00:47,480
stimuli like in basic biology 101 I
 

6407
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:49,430
stimuli like in basic biology 101 I
think and I'm fine with that I don't

6408
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:49,440
think and I'm fine with that I don't
 

6409
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,990
think and I'm fine with that I don't
need it to be more romantic than that

6410
02:00:50,990 --> 02:00:51,000
need it to be more romantic than that
 

6411
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:54,669
need it to be more romantic than that
but I think it's actually comical

6412
02:00:54,669 --> 02:00:54,679
but I think it's actually comical
 

6413
02:00:54,679 --> 02:00:57,830
but I think it's actually comical
how how do you get from a rock to an

6414
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:57,840
how how do you get from a rock to an
 

6415
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,510
how how do you get from a rock to an
orangutan mhm you know and our answer

6416
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:01,520
orangutan mhm you know and our answer
 

6417
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:05,430
orangutan mhm you know and our answer
for that is primordial soup maybe there

6418
02:01:05,430 --> 02:01:05,440
for that is primordial soup maybe there
 

6419
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:07,629
for that is primordial soup maybe there
was just stuff on Earth and then the the

6420
02:01:07,629 --> 02:01:07,639
was just stuff on Earth and then the the
 

6421
02:01:07,639 --> 02:01:09,990
was just stuff on Earth and then the the
the stuff just got up and started

6422
02:01:09,990 --> 02:01:10,000
the stuff just got up and started
 

6423
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,550
the stuff just got up and started
walking maybe there just there was

6424
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:11,560
walking maybe there just there was
 

6425
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:14,470
walking maybe there just there was
nothing happening and then there was all

6426
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:14,480
nothing happening and then there was all
 

6427
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:16,709
nothing happening and then there was all
of a sudden there was a cell mhm and the

6428
02:01:16,709 --> 02:01:16,719
of a sudden there was a cell mhm and the
 

6429
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:17,830
of a sudden there was a cell mhm and the
cell had function and then it

6430
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:17,840
cell had function and then it
 

6431
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:19,229
cell had function and then it
complexified and then it started

6432
02:01:19,229 --> 02:01:19,239
complexified and then it started
 

6433
02:01:19,239 --> 02:01:21,470
complexified and then it started
reproducing and found male and female

6434
02:01:21,470 --> 02:01:21,480
reproducing and found male and female
 

6435
02:01:21,480 --> 02:01:26,629
reproducing and found male and female
parts and and what like it we are so un

6436
02:01:26,629 --> 02:01:26,639
parts and and what like it we are so un
 

6437

02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:03,470
mathematics at all and it seems like
from primordial soups you can get a lot

6464
02:02:03,470 --> 02:02:03,480
from primordial soups you can get a lot
 

6465
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:07,149
from primordial soups you can get a lot
of cool shit and the force of getting

6466
02:02:07,149 --> 02:02:07,159
of cool shit and the force of getting
 

6467
02:02:07,159 --> 02:02:08,229
of cool shit and the force of getting
from

6468
02:02:08,229 --> 02:02:08,239
from
 

6469
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:13,310
from
soup to like two humans on microphones

6470
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:13,320
soup to like two humans on microphones
 

6471
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:16,310
soup to like two humans on microphones
yeah uh not understood and it seems to

6472
02:02:16,310 --> 02:02:16,320
yeah uh not understood and it seems to
 

6473
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:19,229
yeah uh not understood and it seems to
be a thing that happens on Earth I tend

6474
02:02:19,229 --> 02:02:19,239
be a thing that happens on Earth I tend
 

6475
02:02:19,239 --> 02:02:21,229
be a thing that happens on Earth I tend
to think that it's a thing that happens

6476
02:02:21,229 --> 02:02:21,239
to think that it's a thing that happens
 

6477
02:02:21,239 --> 02:02:22,629
to think that it's a thing that happens
everywhere in the the universe and

6478
02:02:22,629 --> 02:02:22,639
everywhere in the the universe and
 

6479
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:24,589
everywhere in the the universe and
there's some

6480
02:02:24,589 --> 02:02:24,599
there's some
 

6481
02:02:24,599 --> 02:02:28,350
there's some
deep Force that's pushing this along in

6482
02:02:28,350 --> 02:02:28,360
deep Force that's pushing this along in
 

6483
02:02:28,360 --> 02:02:31,470
deep Force that's pushing this along in
some way that there's something we uh I

6484
02:02:31,470 --> 02:02:31,480
some way that there's something we uh I
 

6485
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:33,990
some way that there's something we uh I
don't want to sort of

6486
02:02:33,990 --> 02:02:34,000
don't want to sort of
 

6487
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,350
don't want to sort of
uh simplify it but there is something

6488
02:02:37,350 --> 02:02:37,360
uh simplify it but there is something
 

6489
02:02:37,360 --> 02:02:38,990
uh simplify it but there is something
that creates complexity out of

6490
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:39,000
that creates complexity out of
 

6491
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,270
that creates complexity out of
Simplicity that we don't quite

6492
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:41,280
Simplicity that we don't quite
 

6493
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,229
Simplicity that we don't quite
understand uh and that's the thing that

6494
02:02:43,229 --> 02:02:43,239
understand uh and that's the thing that
 

6495
02:02:43,239 --> 02:02:45,870
understand uh and that's the thing that
created the first organism living

6496
02:02:45,870 --> 02:02:45,880
created the first organism living
 

6497
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:49,430
created the first organism living
organism on Earth that like leap from no

6498
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
organism on Earth that like leap from no
 

6499
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:52,910
organism on Earth that like leap from no
life to life on Earth that's a weird one

6500
02:02:52,910 --> 02:02:52,920
life to life on Earth that's a weird one
 

6501
02:02:52,920 --> 02:02:55,350
life to life on Earth that's a weird one
that's a weird one cuz you can

6502
02:02:55,350 --> 02:02:55,360
that's a weird one cuz you can
 

6503
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,470
that's a weird one cuz you can
imagine I think that what the Earth is

6504
02:02:57,470 --> 02:02:57,480
imagine I think that what the Earth is
 

6505
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:59,830
imagine I think that what the Earth is
four 4.5 billion years old and you can

6506
02:02:59,830 --> 02:02:59,840
four 4.5 billion years old and you can
 

6507
02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:02,270
four 4.5 billion years old and you can
imagine just

6508
02:03:02,270 --> 02:03:02,280
imagine just
 

6509
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:04,910
imagine just
this this rock of a planet with like

6510
02:03:04,910 --> 02:03:04,920
this this rock of a planet with like
 

6511
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:09,149
this this rock of a planet with like
rain and storms and elements and iron

6512
02:03:09,149 --> 02:03:09,159
rain and storms and elements and iron
 

6513
02:03:09,159 --> 02:03:13,270
rain and storms and elements and iron
and granite and like just random stuff

6514
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:13,280
and granite and like just random stuff
 

6515
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:16,229
and granite and like just random stuff
it's pretty easy to imagine that but

6516
02:03:16,229 --> 02:03:16,239
it's pretty easy to imagine that but
 

6517
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:18,109
it's pretty easy to imagine that but
then I remember that book that I think

6518
02:03:18,109 --> 02:03:18,119
then I remember that book that I think
 

6519
02:03:18,119 --> 02:03:19,470
then I remember that book that I think
we all have the same book when we were

6520
02:03:19,470 --> 02:03:19,480
we all have the same book when we were
 

6521
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:20,870
we all have the same book when we were
kids and then like they show this like

6522
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:20,880
kids and then like they show this like
 

6523
02:03:20,880 --> 02:03:23,390
kids and then like they show this like
fish-like animal crawling out of a out

6524
02:03:23,390 --> 02:03:23,400
fish-like animal crawling out of a out
 

6525
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,910
fish-like animal crawling out of a out
of the primordial soup and it's like bro

6526
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
of the primordial soup and it's like bro
 

6527
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:28,830
of the primordial soup and it's like bro
you just missed the most important part

6528
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:28,840
you just missed the most important part
 

6529
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:30,430
you just missed the most important part
author of that book

6530
02:03:30,430 --> 02:03:30,440
author of that book
 

6531
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:32,430
author of that book
bro

6532
02:03:32,430 --> 02:03:32,440
bro
 

6533
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:35,069
bro
and and I think the first bacteria came

6534
02:03:35,069 --> 02:03:35,079
and and I think the first bacteria came
 

6535
02:03:35,079 --> 02:03:38,629
and and I think the first bacteria came
in around three 3 3.7 billion years ago

6536
02:03:38,629 --> 02:03:38,639
in around three 3 3.7 billion years ago
 

6537
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:40,310
in around three 3 3.7 billion years ago
so there's like at least like you

6538
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:40,320
so there's like at least like you
 

6539
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:42,430
so there's like at least like you
know a bunch of billion years where

6540
02:03:42,430 --> 02:03:42,440
know a bunch of billion years where
 

6541
02:03:42,440 --> 02:03:43,669
know a bunch of billion years where
there was just nothing it was just a

6542
02:03:43,669 --> 02:03:43,679
there was just nothing it was just a
 

6543
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:45,069
there was just nothing it was just a
planet and then we started seeing

6544
02:03:45,069 --> 02:03:45,079
planet and then we started seeing
 

6545
02:03:45,079 --> 02:03:47,669
planet and then we started seeing
fossils of the first bacteria and the

6546
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
fossils of the first bacteria and the
 

6547
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:50,229
fossils of the first bacteria and the
bacteria stuck around for for a long

6548
02:03:50,229 --> 02:03:50,239
bacteria stuck around for for a long
 

6549
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:51,990
bacteria stuck around for for a long
time a billion two billion years years

6550
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:52,000
time a billion two billion years years
 

6551
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,629
time a billion two billion years years
it's just very very long just bacteria

6552
02:03:54,629 --> 02:03:54,639
it's just very very long just bacteria
 

6553
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:57,750
it's just very very long just bacteria
just bacteria but a lot of them a lot of

6554
02:03:57,750 --> 02:03:57,760
just bacteria but a lot of them a lot of
 

6555
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:59,229
just bacteria but a lot of them a lot of
them there's probably a lot of

6556
02:03:59,229 --> 02:03:59,239
them there's probably a lot of
 

6557
02:03:59,239 --> 02:04:02,390
them there's probably a lot of
innovation a lot of murder a lot of

6558
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:02,400
innovation a lot of murder a lot of
 

6559
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:05,430
innovation a lot of murder a lot of
interaction yeah yeah and then I mean

6560
02:04:05,430 --> 02:04:05,440
interaction yeah yeah and then I mean
 

6561
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:07,149
interaction yeah yeah and then I mean
there's there's a big a few big leaps

6562
02:04:07,149 --> 02:04:07,159
there's there's a big a few big leaps
 

6563
02:04:07,159 --> 02:04:09,350
there's there's a big a few big leaps
along the history of life on Earth yeah

6564
02:04:09,350 --> 02:04:09,360
along the history of life on Earth yeah
 

6565
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:11,109
along the history of life on Earth yeah
you know the Predator prey Dynamic that

6566
02:04:11,109 --> 02:04:11,119
you know the Predator prey Dynamic that
 

6567
02:04:11,119 --> 02:04:12,629
you know the Predator prey Dynamic that
was a really cool Innovation it's almost

6568
02:04:12,629 --> 02:04:12,639
was a really cool Innovation it's almost
 

6569
02:04:12,639 --> 02:04:14,109
was a really cool Innovation it's almost
like Innovations like features on an

6570
02:04:14,109 --> 02:04:14,119
like Innovations like features on an
 

6571
02:04:14,119 --> 02:04:17,189
like Innovations like features on an
iPhone it's like it's nice like uh

6572
02:04:17,189 --> 02:04:17,199
iPhone it's like it's nice like uh
 

6573
02:04:17,199 --> 02:04:22,069
iPhone it's like it's nice like uh
Predator prey uh uats so comp comp Lex

6574
02:04:22,069 --> 02:04:22,079
Predator prey uh uats so comp comp Lex
 

6575
02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:24,069
Predator prey uh uats so comp comp Lex
multicellular

6576
02:04:24,069 --> 02:04:24,079
multicellular
 

6577
02:04:24,079 --> 02:04:27,189
multicellular
organisms uh emerging from the water to

6578
02:04:27,189 --> 02:04:27,199
organisms uh emerging from the water to
 

6579
02:04:27,199 --> 02:04:30,910
organisms uh emerging from the water to
land that was weird that was a a

6580
02:04:30,910 --> 02:04:30,920
land that was weird that was a a
 

6581
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:33,510
land that was weird that was a a
interesting Innovation there's how

6582
02:04:33,510 --> 02:04:33,520
interesting Innovation there's how
 

6583
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:35,870
interesting Innovation there's how
whatever led to

6584
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:35,880
whatever led to
 

6585
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:38,589
whatever led to
humans that there's a lot of interesting

6586
02:04:38,589 --> 02:04:38,599
humans that there's a lot of interesting
 

6587
02:04:38,599 --> 02:04:40,470
humans that there's a lot of interesting
stuff there I see I can't even get that

6588
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:40,480
stuff there I see I can't even get that
 

6589
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:44,350
stuff there I see I can't even get that
far I can't get from Rock and Sand to

6590
02:04:44,350 --> 02:04:44,360
far I can't get from Rock and Sand to
 

6591
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:47,470
far I can't get from Rock and Sand to
cells yeah that's that's a

6592
02:04:47,470 --> 02:04:47,480
cells yeah that's that's a
 

6593
02:04:47,480 --> 02:04:51,109
cells yeah that's that's a
huge I mean I mean to everything around

6594
02:04:51,109 --> 02:04:51,119
huge I mean I mean to everything around
 

6595
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:55,109
huge I mean I mean to everything around
us that has cells it's just it's it's

6596
02:04:55,109 --> 02:04:55,119
us that has cells it's just it's it's
 

6597
02:04:55,119 --> 02:04:57,750
us that has cells it's just it's it's
wild even and I I could imagine being on

6598
02:04:57,750 --> 02:04:57,760
wild even and I I could imagine being on
 

6599
02:04:57,760 --> 02:05:00,709
wild even and I I could imagine being on
another planet and how incredibly

6600
02:05:00,709 --> 02:05:00,719
another planet and how incredibly
 

6601
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:02,990
another planet and how incredibly
valuable this thing would be this this

6602
02:05:02,990 --> 02:05:03,000
valuable this thing would be this this
 

6603
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,669
valuable this thing would be this this
it's impossible to replicate it I'm

6604
02:05:05,669 --> 02:05:05,679
it's impossible to replicate it I'm
 

6605
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:07,069
it's impossible to replicate it I'm
looking at it through the candle light

6606
02:05:07,069 --> 02:05:07,079
looking at it through the candle light
 

6607
02:05:07,079 --> 02:05:08,350
looking at it through the candle light
right now and I can see all of the

6608
02:05:08,350 --> 02:05:08,360
right now and I can see all of the
 

6609
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:10,310
right now and I can see all of the
structures in this Leaf the incredible

6610
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:10,320
structures in this Leaf the incredible
 

6611
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:11,669
structures in this Leaf the incredible
structures in this leaf that look

6612
02:05:11,669 --> 02:05:11,679
structures in this leaf that look
 

6613
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:13,990
structures in this leaf that look
exactly like the veins in my arm which

6614
02:05:13,990 --> 02:05:14,000
exactly like the veins in my arm which
 

6615
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,669
exactly like the veins in my arm which
look exactly like the rivers that are

6616
02:05:15,669 --> 02:05:15,679
look exactly like the rivers that are
 

6617
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:17,229
look exactly like the rivers that are

02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:27,030
understand the complexity the beauty of
it that's what Darren ornowski tried to

6786
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:27,040
it that's what Darren ornowski tried to
 

6787
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,549
it that's what Darren ornowski tried to
do with those couple of films that's

6788
02:08:29,549 --> 02:08:29,559
do with those couple of films that's
 

6789
02:08:29,559 --> 02:08:32,030
do with those couple of films that's
something that I hope you do actually in

6790
02:08:32,030 --> 02:08:32,040
something that I hope you do actually in
 

6791
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:33,310
something that I hope you do actually in
the medium of film too that would be

6792
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:33,320
the medium of film too that would be
 

6793
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:34,910
the medium of film too that would be
very interesting and you do that in the

6794
02:08:34,910 --> 02:08:34,920
very interesting and you do that in the
 

6795
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:36,790
very interesting and you do that in the
medium of books

6796
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:36,800
medium of books
 

6797
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:39,430
medium of books
currently um how much do you think we

6798
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:39,440
currently um how much do you think we
 

6799
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:41,270
currently um how much do you think we
understand about the history of life on

6800
02:08:41,270 --> 02:08:41,280
understand about the history of life on

Earth I think we got it all

6802
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:43,920
Earth I think we got it all
 

6803
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:46,149
Earth I think we got it all
wrong no I don't know it seems like they

6804
02:08:46,149 --> 02:08:46,159
wrong no I don't know it seems like they
 

6805
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:48,189
wrong no I don't know it seems like they
change it all the time you know they

6806
02:08:48,189 --> 02:08:48,199
change it all the time you know they
 

6807
02:08:48,199 --> 02:08:51,030
change it all the time you know they
say they say that Easter Island you know

6808
02:08:51,030 --> 02:08:51,040
say they say that Easter Island you know
 

6809
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:52,350
say they say that Easter Island you know
when I was in College they were big on

6810
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:52,360
when I was in College they were big on
 

6811
02:08:52,360 --> 02:08:53,549
when I was in College they were big on
telling you that Easter Island they

6812
02:08:53,549 --> 02:08:53,559
telling you that Easter Island they
 

6813
02:08:53,559 --> 02:08:56,990
telling you that Easter Island they
ruined their environment and uh they had

6814
02:08:56,990 --> 02:08:57,000
ruined their environment and uh they had
 

6815
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,470
ruined their environment and uh they had
environmental collapse and that's why

6816
02:08:59,470 --> 02:08:59,480
environmental collapse and that's why
 

6817
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:01,030
environmental collapse and that's why
there was nobody on Easter Island it was

6818
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:01,040
there was nobody on Easter Island it was
 

6819
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:02,629
there was nobody on Easter Island it was
a cautionary tale we could ruin our

6820
02:09:02,629 --> 02:09:02,639
a cautionary tale we could ruin our
 

6821
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:03,669
a cautionary tale we could ruin our
environment and now it seems like

6822
02:09:03,669 --> 02:09:03,679
environment and now it seems like
 

6823
02:09:03,679 --> 02:09:05,030
environment and now it seems like
they've changed their mind on that and

6824
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:05,040
they've changed their mind on that and
 

6825
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,990
they've changed their mind on that and
then when humans entered North America

6826
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:08,000
then when humans entered North America
 

6827
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:11,189
then when humans entered North America
seems to be hugely up to speculation and

6828
02:09:11,189 --> 02:09:11,199
seems to be hugely up to speculation and
 

6829
02:09:11,199 --> 02:09:13,109
seems to be hugely up to speculation and
you know the the Africa spreading that

6830
02:09:13,109 --> 02:09:13,119
you know the the Africa spreading that
 

6831
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,549
you know the the Africa spreading that
we all spread out of Africa and then the

6832
02:09:15,549 --> 02:09:15,559
we all spread out of Africa and then the
 

6833
02:09:15,559 --> 02:09:17,390
we all spread out of Africa and then the
the pine Overkill Extinction Theory and

6834
02:09:17,390 --> 02:09:17,400
the pine Overkill Extinction Theory and
 

6835
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:20,149
the pine Overkill Extinction Theory and
it's like it seems like every few years

6836
02:09:20,149 --> 02:09:20,159
it's like it seems like every few years
 

6837
02:09:20,159 --> 02:09:21,669
it's like it seems like every few years
they update it and they change and they

6838
02:09:21,669 --> 02:09:21,679
they update it and they change and they
 

6839
02:09:21,679 --> 02:09:23,430
they update it and they change and they
say oh the guys no no no no the guys

6840
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:23,440
say oh the guys no no no no the guys
 

6841
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,350
say oh the guys no no no no the guys
from 10 years ago actually my new theory

6842
02:09:25,350 --> 02:09:25,360
from 10 years ago actually my new theory
 

6843
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,549
from 10 years ago actually my new theory
is the best theory let's write some

6844
02:09:26,549 --> 02:09:26,559
is the best theory let's write some
 

6845
02:09:26,559 --> 02:09:28,870
is the best theory let's write some
books and get me on Letterman and it

6846
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:28,880
books and get me on Letterman and it
 

6847
02:09:28,880 --> 02:09:30,229
books and get me on Letterman and it
seems like there's a new prevailing

6848
02:09:30,229 --> 02:09:30,239
seems like there's a new prevailing
 

6849
02:09:30,239 --> 02:09:32,109
seems like there's a new prevailing
Theory that's really always exciting and

6850
02:09:32,109 --> 02:09:32,119
Theory that's really always exciting and
 

6851
02:09:32,119 --> 02:09:35,870
Theory that's really always exciting and
edgy about how how we got here and where

6852
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:35,880
edgy about how how we got here and where
 

6853
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:37,830
edgy about how how we got here and where
we came from and how we dispersed and

6854
02:09:37,830 --> 02:09:37,840
we came from and how we dispersed and
 

6855
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,069
we came from and how we dispersed and
maybe even has some political

6856
02:09:39,069 --> 02:09:39,079
maybe even has some political
 

6857
02:09:39,079 --> 02:09:40,990
maybe even has some political
implications like how we should use the

6858
02:09:40,990 --> 02:09:41,000
implications like how we should use the
 

6859
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,270
implications like how we should use the
Amazon moving forward like the Amazon

6860
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:43,280
Amazon moving forward like the Amazon
 

6861
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:45,790
Amazon moving forward like the Amazon
was engineered by people so fuck it

6862
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:45,800
was engineered by people so fuck it
 

6863
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:48,229
was engineered by people so fuck it
let's just cut it down yeah it's I tend

6864
02:09:48,229 --> 02:09:48,239
let's just cut it down yeah it's I tend
 

6865
02:09:48,239 --> 02:09:50,069
let's just cut it down yeah it's I tend
to believe that we mostly don't

6866
02:09:50,069 --> 02:09:50,079
to believe that we mostly don't
 

6867
02:09:50,079 --> 02:09:51,910
to believe that we mostly don't
understand anything but there's an

6868
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:51,920
understand anything but there's an
 

6869
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:54,830
understand anything but there's an
optimism in continuously figuring out

6870
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:54,840
optimism in continuously figuring out
 

6871
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:57,910
optimism in continuously figuring out
the puzzle of that we offline talked

6872
02:09:57,910 --> 02:09:57,920
the puzzle of that we offline talked
 

6873
02:09:57,920 --> 02:10:00,189
the puzzle of that we offline talked
about the the Graham hanock Flint Dibble

6874
02:10:00,189 --> 02:10:00,199
about the the Graham hanock Flint Dibble
 

6875
02:10:00,199 --> 02:10:02,830
about the the Graham hanock Flint Dibble
debate uh on on Rogan I like debates

6876
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:02,840
debate uh on on Rogan I like debates
 

6877
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:05,149
debate uh on on Rogan I like debates
personally so Flint dible represents

6878
02:10:05,149 --> 02:10:05,159
personally so Flint dible represents
 

6879
02:10:05,159 --> 02:10:07,030
personally so Flint dible represents
mainstream archaeology and I actually

6880
02:10:07,030 --> 02:10:07,040
mainstream archaeology and I actually
 

6881
02:10:07,040 --> 02:10:08,510
mainstream archaeology and I actually
like the

6882
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:08,520
like the
 

6883
02:10:08,520 --> 02:10:10,790
like the
whole science the whole field of

history with so little information

6888
02:10:15,669 --> 02:10:15,679
history with so little information
 

6889
02:10:15,679 --> 02:10:17,629

understand and now with modern uh

02:10:28,199 --> 02:10:30,069
understand and now with modern uh
technology as as Flint was trying to

6902
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:30,079
technology as as Flint was trying to
 

6903
02:10:30,079 --> 02:10:32,910
technology as as Flint was trying to
express that you can use large amounts

6904
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:32,920
express that you can use large amounts
 

6905
02:10:32,920 --> 02:10:36,589
express that you can use large amounts
of data that's like imperfect but just

6906
02:10:36,589 --> 02:10:36,599
of data that's like imperfect but just
 

6907
02:10:36,599 --> 02:10:39,750
of data that's like imperfect but just
the scale and using that to reconstruct

6908
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:39,760
the scale and using that to reconstruct
 

6909
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:41,750
the scale and using that to reconstruct
civilizations there different practices

civilizations there different practices
 

6911
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:43,990
civilizations there different practices
from the little details of uh what kind

6912
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000
from the little details of uh what kind
 

6913
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,430
from the little details of uh what kind
of things they eat how they interact

6914
02:10:45,430 --> 02:10:45,440
of things they eat how they interact
 

6915
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:46,589
of things they eat how they interact
with each other what kind of art they

with each other what kind of art they
 

6917
02:10:46,599 --> 02:10:48,990
with each other what kind of art they
create to when they existed what are the

6918
02:10:48,990 --> 02:10:49,000
create to when they existed what are the
 

6919
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:50,669
create to when they existed what are the
time frames all that kind of stuff and

6920
02:10:50,669 --> 02:10:50,679
time frames all that kind of stuff and
 

6921
02:10:50,679 --> 02:10:53,069
time frames all that kind of stuff and
that starts to fill in the gaps of our

6922
02:10:53,069 --> 02:10:53,079
that starts to fill in the gaps of our
 

6923
02:10:53,079 --> 02:10:55,990
that starts to fill in the gaps of our
understanding but still the Arab bars

6924
02:10:55,990 --> 02:10:56,000
understanding but still the Arab bars
 

6925
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:00,270
understanding but still the Arab bars
are large in terms of what really

6926
02:11:00,270 --> 02:11:00,280
are large in terms of what really

animals that are more horizontally based
 

7243
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:02,830
animals that are more horizontally based
and low to the ground they can make it

7244
02:17:02,830 --> 02:17:02,840
and low to the ground they can make it
 

7245
02:17:02,840 --> 02:17:04,270
and low to the ground they can make it
like when we got stuck in those bamboo

7246
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:04,280
like when we got stuck in those bamboo
 

7247
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:06,150
like when we got stuck in those bamboo
patches and we were just hacking through

7248
02:17:06,150 --> 02:17:06,160
patches and we were just hacking through
 

7249
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:08,230
patches and we were just hacking through
them and it's dangerous and there's as

7250
02:17:08,230 --> 02:17:08,240
them and it's dangerous and there's as
 

7251
02:17:08,240 --> 02:17:10,230
them and it's dangerous and there's as
you hit the bamboo it ricochets and

7252
02:17:10,230 --> 02:17:10,240
you hit the bamboo it ricochets and
 

7253
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:12,270
you hit the bamboo it ricochets and
there's spikes and then one piece Falls

7254
02:17:12,270 --> 02:17:12,280
there's spikes and then one piece Falls
 

7255
02:17:12,280 --> 02:17:14,870
there's spikes and then one piece Falls
and it pulls a a train a Vine that has

7256
02:17:14,870 --> 02:17:14,880
and it pulls a a train a Vine that has
 

7257
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:16,270
and it pulls a a train a Vine that has
spikes on it and that hits you in the

7258
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:16,280
spikes on it and that hits you in the
 

7259
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:18,870
spikes on it and that hits you in the
neck and it just the jungle is Savage to

7260

neck and it just the jungle is Savage to
 

7261
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:23,070
neck and it just the jungle is Savage to
humans but if you are an a gy a little

7262
02:17:23,070 --> 02:17:23,080
humans but if you are an a gy a little
 

7263
02:17:23,080 --> 02:17:25,509
humans but if you are an a gy a little
rodent or a jaguar or a deer you can

7264
02:17:25,509 --> 02:17:25,519
rodent or a jaguar or a deer you can
 

7265
02:17:25,519 --> 02:17:26,750
rodent or a jaguar or a deer you can
kind of slip through this stuff and the

7266
02:17:26,750 --> 02:17:26,760
kind of slip through this stuff and the
 

7267
02:17:26,760 --> 02:17:28,629
kind of slip through this stuff and the
deer have developed really small antlers

7268
02:17:28,629 --> 02:17:28,639
deer have developed really small antlers
 

7269
02:17:28,639 --> 02:17:30,110
deer have developed really small antlers
they can just kind of weave through low

7270
02:17:30,110 --> 02:17:30,120
they can just kind of weave through low
 

7271
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:32,870
they can just kind of weave through low
to the ground and so and so for us being

7272
02:17:32,870 --> 02:17:32,880
to the ground and so and so for us being
 

7273
02:17:32,880 --> 02:17:33,629
to the ground and so and so for us being
these

7274
02:17:33,629 --> 02:17:33,639
these
 

7275
02:17:33,639 --> 02:17:36,150
these
vertical beings walking through the

7276
02:17:36,150 --> 02:17:36,160
vertical beings walking through the
 

7277
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:38,349
vertical beings walking through the
jungle it it really helps to be able to

7278
02:17:38,349 --> 02:17:38,359
jungle it it really helps to be able to
 

7279
02:17:38,359 --> 02:17:40,230
jungle it it really helps to be able to
move the sticks that are diagonally

7280
02:17:40,230 --> 02:17:40,240
move the sticks that are diagonally
 

7281
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:41,790

your body as you saw last night we can
use it to find food mhm you want machete

7290
02:17:51,349 --> 02:17:51,359
use it to find food mhm you want machete
 

7291

fishing you cut a fish head off with a
 

7293
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:59,030
fishing you cut a fish head off with a
machete by like it was swimming and then

7294
02:17:59,030 --> 02:17:59,040
machete by like it was swimming and then
 

7295
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:03,990
machete by like it was swimming and then
you basically you know uh macheted the

7296
02:18:03,990 --> 02:18:04,000
you basically you know uh macheted the
 

7297
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,790
you basically you know uh macheted the
water and the other fascinating thing

7298
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:06,800
water and the other fascinating thing
 

7299
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,709
water and the other fascinating thing
about that fish without his head it kept

7300
02:18:08,709 --> 02:18:08,719
about that fish without his head it kept
 

7301
02:18:08,719 --> 02:18:11,030
about that fish without his head it kept
moving soing was just using I guess his

7302
02:18:11,030 --> 02:18:11,040
moving soing was just using I guess his
 

7303
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:13,990
moving soing was just using I guess his
nervous system to uh to swim beautifully

7304
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,000
nervous system to uh to swim beautifully
 

7305
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,790
nervous system to uh to swim beautifully
I mean I that there's so many questions

7306
02:18:15,790 --> 02:18:15,800
I mean I that there's so many questions
 

7307
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:17,790
I mean I that there's so many questions
there about how nature works because

7308
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:17,800
there about how nature works because
 

7309
02:18:17,800 --> 02:18:19,190
there about how nature works because
well let's explain it because the way

7310
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:19,200
well let's explain it because the way
 

7311
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:20,830
well let's explain it because the way
the machete hit this fish it kind of

7312
02:18:20,830 --> 02:18:20,840
the machete hit this fish it kind of
 

7313
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:23,870
the machete hit this fish it kind of
kind of took his just his his eyes off

of and his lower jaw was still there so
 

7317
02:18:25,479 --> 02:18:27,830
of and his lower jaw was still there so
it really just like the brain and and

7318
02:18:27,830 --> 02:18:27,840
it really just like the brain and and
 

7319
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:30,389
it really just like the brain and and
the top jaw that came off and this fish

7320
02:18:30,389 --> 02:18:30,399
the top jaw that came off and this fish
 

7321
02:18:30,399 --> 02:18:32,070
the top jaw that came off and this fish
as the the dust cleared in this stream

in a very like Interstellar way like it
 

7327
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:38,589
in a very like Interstellar way like it
was just the programming was still there

7328
02:18:38,589 --> 02:18:38,599
was just the programming was still there
 

7329
02:18:38,599 --> 02:18:40,150
was just the programming was still there
but the brain was gone and the fish was

7330
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:40,160
but the brain was gone and the fish was
 

7331
02:18:40,160 --> 02:18:41,429
but the brain was gone and the fish was
just still moving and it was going to

was it was something and you're still
trying to catch it which is interesting

7340
02:18:48,389 --> 02:18:48,399
trying to catch it which is interesting
 

7341
02:18:48,399 --> 02:18:49,509
trying to catch it which is interesting
I still have to work to catch it cuz

7342
02:18:49,509 --> 02:18:49,519
I still have to work to catch it cuz
 

7343
02:18:49,519 --> 02:18:51,070
I still have to work to catch it cuz
every time I caught it it would it freak

7344
02:18:51,070 --> 02:18:51,080
every time I caught it it would it freak
 

7345
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:52,230
every time I caught it it would it freak
out and then it would jump back in the

7346
02:18:52,230 --> 02:18:52,240
out and then it would jump back in the
 

7347
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:53,750
out and then it would jump back in the
water and I'm programmed here from years

7348
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:53,760
water and I'm programmed here from years
 

7349
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:55,750
water and I'm programmed here from years
and years of living in the Amazon that

7350
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:55,760
and years of living in the Amazon that
 

7351
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:57,750
and years of living in the Amazon that
everything can hurt you so you actually

7352
02:18:57,750 --> 02:18:57,760
everything can hurt you so you actually
 

7353
02:18:57,760 --> 02:19:00,790
everything can hurt you so you actually
become quite you know if a moth lands on

7354
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:00,800
become quite you know if a moth lands on
 

7355
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,150
become quite you know if a moth lands on
you you flick it because it could be a

7356
02:19:02,150 --> 02:19:02,160
you you flick it because it could be a
 

7357
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:03,669
you you flick it because it could be a
bullet ant and so even the fish here a

7358
02:19:03,669 --> 02:19:03,679
bullet ant and so even the fish here a
 

7359
02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:05,150
bullet ant and so even the fish here a
lot of the fish here have spikes coming

7360
02:19:05,150 --> 02:19:05,160
lot of the fish here have spikes coming
 

7361
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:07,110
lot of the fish here have spikes coming
out of them and so even though I know

7362
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:07,120
out of them and so even though I know
 

7363
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:08,910
out of them and so even though I know
that fish I know its name I've eaten

7364
02:19:08,910 --> 02:19:08,920
that fish I know its name I've eaten
 

7365
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:11,509
that fish I know its name I've eaten
them many times as I was holding it when

7366
02:19:11,509 --> 02:19:11,519
them many times as I was holding it when
 

7367
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:13,030
them many times as I was holding it when
it would twitch with that explosive

7368
02:19:13,030 --> 02:19:13,040
it would twitch with that explosive
 

7369
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:14,549
it would twitch with that explosive
power just like the Cayman I would I

7370
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:14,559
power just like the Cayman I would I
 

7371
02:19:14,559 --> 02:19:16,870
power just like the Cayman I would I
would I would get that fear response and

7372
02:19:16,870 --> 02:19:16,880
would I would get that fear response and
 

7373
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:18,750
would I would get that fear response and
release it and so that happened three or

7374
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:18,760
release it and so that happened three or
 

7375
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:20,190
release it and so that happened three or
four times before I finally said this is

7376
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:20,200
four times before I finally said this is
 

7377
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:22,750
four times before I finally said this is
stupid even though he's slippery he

7378

02:19:39,030 --> 02:19:39,040
existence that I was able to enjoy that
 

7393
02:19:39,040 --> 02:19:41,509
existence that I was able to enjoy that
delicious delicious fish so the machete

7394
02:19:41,509 --> 02:19:41,519
delicious delicious fish so the machete
 

7395
02:19:41,519 --> 02:19:43,190
delicious delicious fish so the machete
is used to cut through this extremely

7396
02:19:43,190 --> 02:19:43,200
is used to cut through this extremely
 

7397
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:44,830
is used to cut through this extremely
dense jungle there's Vines by the way

7398
02:19:44,830 --> 02:19:44,840
dense jungle there's Vines by the way
 

7399
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:47,030
dense jungle there's Vines by the way
there rope like things that are

7400
02:19:47,030 --> 02:19:47,040
there rope like things that are
 

7401
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:49,389
there rope like things that are
extremely strong and they go all kinds

7402
02:19:49,389 --> 02:19:49,399
extremely strong and they go all kinds
 

7403
02:19:49,399 --> 02:19:51,150
extremely strong and they go all kinds
of directions to go horizontal and all

7404
02:19:51,150 --> 02:19:51,160
of directions to go horizontal and all
 

7405
02:19:51,160 --> 02:19:54,389
of directions to go horizontal and all
this I I don't even how tree we have a

7406
02:19:54,389 --> 02:19:54,399
this I I don't even how tree we have a
 

7407
02:19:54,399 --> 02:19:57,510
this I I don't even how tree we have a
tree right above us that makes no

7408
02:19:57,510 --> 02:19:57,520
tree right above us that makes no
 

7409
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:00,030
tree right above us that makes no
sense there's like a tree that kind of

7410
02:20:00,030 --> 02:20:00,040
sense there's like a tree that kind of
 

7411
02:20:00,040 --> 02:20:03,309
sense there's like a tree that kind of
failed and then a new tree was created

7412
02:20:03,309 --> 02:20:03,319
failed and then a new tree was created
 

7413
02:20:03,319 --> 02:20:06,670
failed and then a new tree was created
on top of it that makes it just makes no

7414
02:20:06,670 --> 02:20:06,680
on top of it that makes it just makes no
 

7415
02:20:06,680 --> 02:20:08,750
on top of it that makes it just makes no
sense it feels like sometimes trees come

7416
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:08,760
sense it feels like sometimes trees come
 

7417
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:11,270
sense it feels like sometimes trees come
from the uh from the sky sometimes they

7418
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:11,280
from the uh from the sky sometimes they
 

7419
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:13,270
from the uh from the sky sometimes they
come from the ground I don't I don't

7420
02:20:13,270 --> 02:20:13,280
come from the ground I don't I don't
 

7421
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:16,150
come from the ground I don't I don't
really quite understand the how that

7422
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:16,160
really quite understand the how that
 

7423
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:18,990
really quite understand the how that
works cuz there's new trees that grow on

7424
02:20:18,990 --> 02:20:19,000
works cuz there's new trees that grow on
 

7425
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,950
works cuz there's new trees that grow on
Old trees and the old trees rot away and

7426
02:20:20,950 --> 02:20:20,960
Old trees and the old trees rot away and
 

7427
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:23,309
Old trees and the old trees rot away and
the new trees come up that whole

7428
02:20:23,309 --> 02:20:23,319
the new trees come up that whole
 

7429
02:20:23,319 --> 02:20:25,270
the new trees come up that whole
mechanism Strangler figs and so

7430
02:20:25,270 --> 02:20:25,280
mechanism Strangler figs and so
 

7431
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:27,030
mechanism Strangler figs and so
Strangler figs as you go across the

7432
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:27,040
Strangler figs as you go across the
 

7433
02:20:27,040 --> 02:20:28,830
Strangler figs as you go across the
world's ecosystems that whole belt of

7434
02:20:28,830 --> 02:20:28,840
world's ecosystems that whole belt of
 

7435
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:30,550
world's ecosystems that whole belt of
you know whether you're in rainforest in

7436
02:20:30,550 --> 02:20:30,560
you know whether you're in rainforest in
 

7437
02:20:30,560 --> 02:20:34,270
you know whether you're in rainforest in
the Amazon the Congo Indonesia all

7438
02:20:34,270 --> 02:20:34,280
the Amazon the Congo Indonesia all
 

7439
02:20:34,280 --> 02:20:35,670
the Amazon the Congo Indonesia all
across the tropics you have Strangler

7440
02:20:35,670 --> 02:20:35,680
across the tropics you have Strangler
 

7441
02:20:35,680 --> 02:20:38,510
across the tropics you have Strangler
figs and the amazing thing that this

7442
02:20:38,510 --> 02:20:38,520
figs and the amazing thing that this
 

7443
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:40,150
figs and the amazing thing that this
that this species does it's become a

7444
02:20:40,150 --> 02:20:40,160
that this species does it's become a
 

7445
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:43,389
that this species does it's become a
keystone species across the planet with

7446
02:20:43,389 --> 02:20:43,399
keystone species across the planet with
 

7447
02:20:43,399 --> 02:20:45,150
keystone species across the planet with
a hyper influence on its ecosystem

7448
02:20:45,150 --> 02:20:45,160
a hyper influence on its ecosystem
 

7449
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:46,910
a hyper influence on its ecosystem
wherever it is because they produce

7450
02:20:46,910 --> 02:20:46,920
wherever it is because they produce
 

7451
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:49,110
wherever it is because they produce
fruit in the dry season when the rest of

7452
02:20:49,110 --> 02:20:49,120
fruit in the dry season when the rest of
 

7453
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:51,590
fruit in the dry season when the rest of
the forest is making it hard for animals

7454
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:51,600
the forest is making it hard for animals
 

7455
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:53,510
the forest is making it hard for animals
to find fruit to find food and so the

7456
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:53,520
to find fruit to find food and so the
 

7457
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:55,590
to find fruit to find food and so the
bats the birds the monkeys they all go

7458
02:20:55,590 --> 02:20:55,600
bats the birds the monkeys they all go
 

7459
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:57,750
bats the birds the monkeys they all go
to the Strangler fig they eat the fruit

7460
02:20:57,750 --> 02:20:57,760
to the Strangler fig they eat the fruit
 

7461
02:20:57,760 --> 02:20:59,750
to the Strangler fig they eat the fruit
and the fruit of course is just tricking

7462
02:20:59,750 --> 02:20:59,760
and the fruit of course is just tricking
 

7463
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:01,270
and the fruit of course is just tricking
the animals the the the plants are

7464
02:21:01,270 --> 02:21:01,280
the animals the the the plants are
 

7465
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:03,110
the animals the the the plants are
tricking the animals into carrying their

7466
02:21:03,110 --> 02:21:03,120
tricking the animals into carrying their
 

7467
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:05,190
tricking the animals into carrying their
seeds to another tree and so they're

7468
02:21:05,190 --> 02:21:05,200
seeds to another tree and so they're
 

7469
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:07,790
seeds to another tree and so they're
getting free Transportation monkey takes

7470
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:07,800
getting free Transportation monkey takes
 

7471
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:09,150
getting free Transportation monkey takes
a poop on another tree after eating

7472
02:21:09,150 --> 02:21:09,160
a poop on another tree after eating
 

7473
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:10,670
a poop on another tree after eating
Strangler figs and then that Strangler

7474
02:21:10,670 --> 02:21:10,680
Strangler figs and then that Strangler
 

7475
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:13,550
Strangler figs and then that Strangler
fig sends out its Vines gets to the

7476
02:21:13,550 --> 02:21:13,560
fig sends out its Vines gets to the
 

7477
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:15,510
fig sends out its Vines gets to the
ground and then as soon as it begins

7478
02:21:15,510 --> 02:21:15,520
ground and then as soon as it begins
 

7479
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:18,309
ground and then as soon as it begins
sucking up nutrients out competes that

7480
02:21:18,309 --> 02:21:18,319
sucking up nutrients out competes that
 

7481
02:21:18,319 --> 02:21:19,550
sucking up nutrients out competes that
tree for

7482
02:21:19,550 --> 02:21:19,560
tree for
 

7483
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:24,270
tree for
light grows hyperdrive around the trunk

7484
02:21:24,270 --> 02:21:24,280
light grows hyperdrive around the trunk
 

7485
02:21:24,280 --> 02:21:26,309
light grows hyperdrive around the trunk
of that tree and then eventually that

7486
02:21:26,309 --> 02:21:26,319
of that tree and then eventually that
 

7487
02:21:26,319 --> 02:21:28,150
of that tree and then eventually that
tree will die and the Strangler fig will

7488
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:28,160
tree will die and the Strangler fig will
 

7489
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:30,670
tree will die and the Strangler fig will
win because it got a it got a boost up

7490
02:21:30,670 --> 02:21:30,680
win because it got a it got a boost up
 

7491
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:32,349
win because it got a it got a boost up
to the top whereas these little trees

7492
02:21:32,349 --> 02:21:32,359
to the top whereas these little trees
 

7493
02:21:32,359 --> 02:21:33,389
to the top whereas these little trees
down here they're going to have to wait

7494
02:21:33,389 --> 02:21:33,399
down here they're going to have to wait
 

7495
02:21:33,399 --> 02:21:34,630
down here they're going to have to wait
their turn they have to wait until a

7496
02:21:34,630 --> 02:21:34,640
their turn they have to wait until a
 

7497
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:36,270
their turn they have to wait until a
tree falls until there's a light Gap and

7498
02:21:36,270 --> 02:21:36,280
tree falls until there's a light Gap and
 

7499
02:21:36,280 --> 02:21:39,110
tree falls until there's a light Gap and
then they have enough food to grow quick

7500
02:21:39,110 --> 02:21:39,120
then they have enough food to grow quick
 

7501
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:40,550
then they have enough food to grow quick
and so this whole thing is an energy

7502
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:40,560
and so this whole thing is an energy
 

7503
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:42,309
and so this whole thing is an energy
economy everything is just trying to get

7504
02:21:42,309 --> 02:21:42,319
economy everything is just trying to get
 

7505
02:21:42,319 --> 02:21:44,349
economy everything is just trying to get
sunlight and so Strangler

7506
02:21:44,349 --> 02:21:44,359
sunlight and so Strangler
 

7507
02:21:44,359 --> 02:21:47,710
sunlight and so Strangler
figs yeah top down trees growing over

7508
02:21:47,710 --> 02:21:47,720
figs yeah top down trees growing over
 

7509
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:50,070
figs yeah top down trees growing over
parasitic top down octopus trees growing

7510
02:21:50,070 --> 02:21:50,080
parasitic top down octopus trees growing
 

7511
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:51,910
parasitic top down octopus trees growing
over other giant trees and you've seen

7512
02:21:51,910 --> 02:21:51,920
over other giant trees and you've seen
 

7513
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:54,550
over other giant trees and you've seen
the size of some of the trees here so uh

7514
02:21:54,550 --> 02:21:54,560
the size of some of the trees here so uh
 

7515
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:56,070
the size of some of the trees here so uh
you know back to Percy Fon and

7516
02:21:56,070 --> 02:21:56,080
you know back to Percy Fon and
 

7517
02:21:56,080 --> 02:21:57,429
you know back to Percy Fon and
exploration what do you think it was

7518
02:21:57,429 --> 02:21:57,439
exploration what do you think it was
 

7519
02:21:57,439 --> 02:22:00,389
exploration what do you think it was
like for him back then a 100 years ago

7520
02:22:00,389 --> 02:22:00,399
like for him back then a 100 years ago
 

7521
02:22:00,399 --> 02:22:03,150
like for him back then a 100 years ago
God damn going through the jungle well

7522
02:22:03,150 --> 02:22:03,160
God damn going through the jungle well
 

7523
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:04,990
God damn going through the jungle well
see the thing is those guys didn't go

7524
02:22:04,990 --> 02:22:05,000
see the thing is those guys didn't go
 

7525
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,550
see the thing is those guys didn't go
with the locals they came down here with

7526
02:22:07,550 --> 02:22:07,560
with the locals they came down here with
 

7527
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:09,590
with the locals they came down here with
like mules and they tried to do it their

7528
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:09,600
like mules and they tried to do it their
 

7529
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:11,990
like mules and they tried to do it their
way yeah and so he's one of the people

7530
02:22:11,990 --> 02:22:12,000
way yeah and so he's one of the people
 

7531
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,190
way yeah and so he's one of the people
that wrote about the green

7532
02:22:14,190 --> 02:22:14,200
that wrote about the green
 

7533
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:18,670
that wrote about the green
hell the jungle as the oppressive ah war

7534
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:18,680
hell the jungle as the oppressive ah war
 

7535
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:20,750
hell the jungle as the oppressive ah war
zone where there's nothing to eat eat

7536
02:22:20,750 --> 02:22:20,760
zone where there's nothing to eat eat
 

7537
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:22,830
zone where there's nothing to eat eat
and everything is killing you and

7538
02:22:22,830 --> 02:22:22,840
and everything is killing you and
 

7539
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:26,309
and everything is killing you and
it's I I think I think that that image

7540
02:22:26,309 --> 02:22:26,319
it's I I think I think that that image
 

7541
02:22:26,319 --> 02:22:29,750
it's I I think I think that that image
is so wrong CU as you saw last night we

7542

like take you on a mental Journey that's

7922
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:03,000
like take you on a mental Journey that's
 

7923
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:04,469
like take you on a mental Journey that's
interesting so you don't think trial and

7924
02:30:04,469 --> 02:30:04,479
interesting so you don't think trial and
 

7925
02:30:04,479 --> 02:30:07,150
interesting so you don't think trial and
eror is possible I was reading about

7926
02:30:07,150 --> 02:30:07,160
eror is possible I was reading about
 

7927
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:09,309
eror is possible I was reading about
iasa and they say they were saying

7928
02:30:09,309 --> 02:30:09,319
iasa and they say they were saying
 

7929
02:30:09,319 --> 02:30:12,070
iasa and they say they were saying
statistically if if you know if a bunch

7930
02:30:12,070 --> 02:30:12,080
statistically if if you know if a bunch
 

7931
02:30:12,080 --> 02:30:14,190
statistically if if you know if a bunch
if you put a thousand humans in the

7932
02:30:14,190 --> 02:30:14,200
if you put a thousand humans in the
 

7933
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:16,269
if you put a thousand humans in the
Amazon and gave them villages to live in

7934
02:30:16,269 --> 02:30:16,279
Amazon and gave them villages to live in
 

7935
02:30:16,279 --> 02:30:18,990
Amazon and gave them villages to live in
because humans are communalist species

7936
02:30:18,990 --> 02:30:19,000
because humans are communalist species
 

7937
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:20,910
because humans are communalist species
it would take 10 and tens of thousands

7938
02:30:20,910 --> 02:30:20,920
it would take 10 and tens of thousands
 

7939
02:30:20,920 --> 02:30:23,469
it would take 10 and tens of thousands
of years or perhaps even centuries

7940
02:30:23,469 --> 02:30:23,479
of years or perhaps even centuries
 

7941
02:30:23,479 --> 02:30:25,389
of years or perhaps even centuries
before even the possibility it's like

7942
02:30:25,389 --> 02:30:25,399
before even the possibility it's like
 

7943
02:30:25,399 --> 02:30:26,590
before even the possibility it's like
that thing you know a bunch of chips on

02:30:28,399 --> 02:30:32,510
a keyboard how could they write Hamlet
it's like astronomical odds to get

7948
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:32,520
it's like astronomical odds to get
 

7949
02:30:32,520 --> 02:30:35,830
it's like astronomical odds to get
to oh wait this and this dosed together

7950
02:30:35,830 --> 02:30:35,840
to oh wait this and this dosed together
 

7951
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:37,990
to oh wait this and this dosed together
and so what the local people believe is

7952
02:30:37,990 --> 02:30:38,000
and so what the local people believe is
 

7953
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,110
and so what the local people believe is
that the gods revealed this

7954
02:30:41,110 --> 02:30:41,120
that the gods revealed this
 

7955
02:30:41,120 --> 02:30:43,950
that the gods revealed this
secret Through the Jungle to us as a

7956
02:30:43,950 --> 02:30:43,960
secret Through the Jungle to us as a
 

7957
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:47,030
secret Through the Jungle to us as a
link to the spirit world and that that's

7958
02:30:47,030 --> 02:30:47,040
link to the spirit world and that that's
 

7959
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:50,110
link to the spirit world and that that's
how we know this because if they didn't

7960
02:30:50,110 --> 02:30:50,120
how we know this because if they didn't
 

7961
02:30:50,120 --> 02:30:51,870
how we know this because if they didn't
remember it from their ancestors we

7962
02:30:51,870 --> 02:30:51,880
remember it from their ancestors we
 

7963
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:53,349
remember it from their ancestors we
would have no idea how to get this

7964
02:30:53,349 --> 02:30:53,359
would have no idea how to get this
 

7965
02:30:53,359 --> 02:30:56,590
would have no idea how to get this
information from the wild

7966
02:30:56,590 --> 02:30:56,600
information from the wild
 

7967
02:30:56,600 --> 02:31:00,550
information from the wild
so I will likely do

7968

about right now is water mhm and I feel

8312
02:37:44,070 --> 02:37:44,080
about right now is water mhm and I feel
 

8313
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:46,030
about right now is water mhm and I feel
like in that moment we were United in

8314
02:37:46,030 --> 02:37:46,040
like in that moment we were United in
 

8315
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:48,190
like in that moment we were United in
the in the simple reality of the fact

8316
02:37:48,190 --> 02:37:48,200
the in the simple reality of the fact
 

8317
02:37:48,200 --> 02:37:50,790
the in the simple reality of the fact
that we were so thirsty that it

8318
02:37:50,790 --> 02:37:50,800
that we were so thirsty that it
 

8319
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:54,349
that we were so thirsty that it
hurt and that it was a little

8320
02:37:54,349 --> 02:37:54,359
hurt and that it was a little
 

8321
02:37:54,359 --> 02:37:59,110
hurt and that it was a little
scary yeah uh it was scary but also

8322
02:37:59,110 --> 02:37:59,120
scary yeah uh it was scary but also
 

8323
02:37:59,120 --> 02:38:03,550
scary yeah uh it was scary but also
there's like

8324
02:38:03,550 --> 02:38:03,560

 

8325
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:06,670

a a joy in the interaction with the

8326
02:38:06,670 --> 02:38:06,680
a a joy in the interaction with the
 

8327
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:09,389
a a joy in the interaction with the
water because it cools your body

8328
02:38:09,389 --> 02:38:09,399
water because it cools your body
 

8329
02:38:09,399 --> 02:38:12,190
water because it cools your body
temperature down and there's like a

8330
02:38:12,190 --> 02:38:12,200
temperature down and there's like a
 

8331
02:38:12,200 --> 02:38:14,590
temperature down and there's like a
faith in that interaction that

8332
02:38:14,590 --> 02:38:14,600
faith in that interaction that
 

8333
02:38:14,600 --> 02:38:17,429
faith in that interaction that
eventually we'll find clean water

8334
02:38:17,429 --> 02:38:17,439
eventually we'll find clean water
 

8335
02:38:17,439 --> 02:38:19,510
eventually we'll find clean water
because uh water is plentiful on Earth

8336
02:38:19,510 --> 02:38:19,520
because uh water is plentiful on Earth
 

8337
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:21,550
because uh water is plentiful on Earth
Earth it's kind of like a delusional

8338
02:38:21,550 --> 02:38:21,560
Earth it's kind of like a delusional
 

8339
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:24,510
Earth it's kind of like a delusional
faith that eventually we'll find it was

8340
02:38:24,510 --> 02:38:24,520
faith that eventually we'll find it was
 

8341
02:38:24,520 --> 02:38:27,630
faith that eventually we'll find it was
just like a little

8342
02:38:27,630 --> 02:38:27,640

 

8343
02:38:27,640 --> 02:38:30,750

celebration I think the cooling aspect

8344
02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:30,760
celebration I think the cooling aspect
 

8345
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:33,790
celebration I think the cooling aspect
of the water cuz uh you know the body

8346
02:38:33,790 --> 02:38:33,800
of the water cuz uh you know the body
 

8347
02:38:33,800 --> 02:38:36,030
of the water cuz uh you know the body
temperature is really high from

8348
02:38:36,030 --> 02:38:36,040
temperature is really high from
 

8349
02:38:36,040 --> 02:38:38,349
temperature is really high from
traversing the really dense jungle and

8350
02:38:38,349 --> 02:38:38,359
traversing the really dense jungle and
 

8351
02:38:38,359 --> 02:38:41,950
traversing the really dense jungle and
just the cooling was somehow grounding

8352
02:38:41,950 --> 02:38:41,960
just the cooling was somehow grounding
 

8353
02:38:41,960 --> 02:38:44,710
just the cooling was somehow grounding
in a way that nothing else really is

8354
02:38:44,710 --> 02:38:44,720
in a way that nothing else really is
 

8355
02:38:44,720 --> 02:38:46,830
in a way that nothing else really is
yeah it was a little celebration of life

8356
02:38:46,830 --> 02:38:46,840
yeah it was a little celebration of life
 

8357
02:38:46,840 --> 02:38:49,110
yeah it was a little celebration of life
of life on Earth of Earth of the Jungle

8358
02:38:49,110 --> 02:38:49,120
of life on Earth of Earth of the Jungle
 

8359
02:38:49,120 --> 02:38:50,790
of life on Earth of Earth of the Jungle
of everything everything it was nice it

8360
02:38:50,790 --> 02:38:50,800
of everything everything it was nice it
 

8361
02:38:50,800 --> 02:38:53,910
of everything everything it was nice it
was a nice moment I think about that had

8362
02:38:53,910 --> 02:38:53,920
was a nice moment I think about that had
 

8363
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:55,630
was a nice moment I think about that had
a couple of those there one in the

8364
02:38:55,630 --> 02:38:55,640
a couple of those there one in the
 

8365
02:38:55,640 --> 02:38:58,070
a couple of those there one in the
puddle and one in the

8366
02:38:58,070 --> 02:38:58,080
puddle and one in the
 

8367
02:38:58,080 --> 02:39:01,429
puddle and one in the
river one was uh full of delusion and

8368
02:39:01,429 --> 02:39:01,439
river one was uh full of delusion and
 

8369
02:39:01,439 --> 02:39:03,870
river one was uh full of delusion and
fear and the other one was full of uh

8370
02:39:03,870 --> 02:39:03,880
fear and the other one was full of uh
 

8371
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:06,790
fear and the other one was full of uh
relief and

8372
02:39:06,790 --> 02:39:06,800

 

8373
02:39:06,800 --> 02:39:09,030

celebration yeah I've I've you know

8374
02:39:09,030 --> 02:39:09,040
celebration yeah I've I've you know
 

8375
02:39:09,040 --> 02:39:10,710
celebration yeah I've I've you know
there's this thing that they they say

8376
02:39:10,710 --> 02:39:10,720
there's this thing that they they say
 

8377
02:39:10,720 --> 02:39:12,710
there's this thing that they they say
where the the the all the pleasure in

8378
02:39:12,710 --> 02:39:12,720
where the the the all the pleasure in
 

8379
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:14,870
where the the the all the pleasure in
life is derived from the

8380
02:39:14,870 --> 02:39:14,880
life is derived from the
 

8381
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:17,510
life is derived from the
transitions when you're cold warm feels

8382
02:39:17,510 --> 02:39:17,520
transitions when you're cold warm feels
 

8383
02:39:17,520 --> 02:39:19,590
transitions when you're cold warm feels
good when you're hot cold feels good

8384
02:39:19,590 --> 02:39:19,600
good when you're hot cold feels good
 

8385
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:23,070
good when you're hot cold feels good
when you're hungry food feels good and

8386
02:39:23,070 --> 02:39:23,080
when you're hungry food feels good and
 

8387
02:39:23,080 --> 02:39:25,389
when you're hungry food feels good and
when you're that thirsty water becomes

8388
02:39:25,389 --> 02:39:25,399
when you're that thirsty water becomes
 

8389
02:39:25,399 --> 02:39:29,110
when you're that thirsty water becomes
God mhm and it's all you want and also

8390
02:39:29,110 --> 02:39:29,120
God mhm and it's all you want and also
 

8391
02:39:29,120 --> 02:39:30,309
God mhm and it's all you want and also
and also the other thing is that when

8392
02:39:30,309 --> 02:39:30,319
and also the other thing is that when
 

8393
02:39:30,319 --> 02:39:32,590
and also the other thing is that when
you're when we're out there it felt so

8394
02:39:32,590 --> 02:39:32,600
you're when we're out there it felt so
 

8395
02:39:32,600 --> 02:39:35,630
you're when we're out there it felt so
good to be so lost and so tired and so

8396
02:39:35,630 --> 02:39:35,640
good to be so lost and so tired and so
 

8397
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:37,230
good to be so lost and so tired and so
like we were doing level like like how

8398
02:39:37,230 --> 02:39:37,240
like we were doing level like like how
 

8399
02:39:37,240 --> 02:39:39,870
like we were doing level like like how
would you how would you describe um the

8400
02:39:39,870 --> 02:39:39,880
would you how would you describe um the
 

8401
02:39:39,880 --> 02:39:42,070
would you how would you describe um the
physicality of what we were doing the

8402
02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:42,080
physicality of what we were doing the
 

8403
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:44,950
physicality of what we were doing the
level of physical like exertion well

8404
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:44,960
level of physical like exertion well
 

8405
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:46,670
level of physical like exertion well
it's something

8406
02:39:46,670 --> 02:39:46,680
it's something
 

8407
02:39:46,680 --> 02:39:48,910
it's something
that I've haven't train I don't even

8408
02:39:48,910 --> 02:39:48,920
that I've haven't train I don't even
 

8409
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:50,190
that I've haven't train I don't even
know how you were trained for that kind

8410
02:39:50,190 --> 02:39:50,200
know how you were trained for that kind
 

8411
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:52,870
know how you were trained for that kind
of thing but it's extremely dense jungle

8412
02:39:52,870 --> 02:39:52,880
of thing but it's extremely dense jungle
 

8413
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:57,150
of thing but it's extremely dense jungle
so every single step is like completely

8414
02:39:57,150 --> 02:39:57,160
so every single step is like completely
 

8415
02:39:57,160 --> 02:39:59,070
so every single step is like completely
unpredictable in terms of the terrain

8416
02:39:59,070 --> 02:39:59,080
unpredictable in terms of the terrain
 

8417
02:39:59,080 --> 02:40:01,710
unpredictable in terms of the terrain
your foot interacts with so the

8418
02:40:01,710 --> 02:40:01,720
your foot interacts with so the
 

8419
02:40:01,720 --> 02:40:04,269
your foot interacts with so the
different variety of slippery that is in

8420
02:40:04,269 --> 02:40:04,279
different variety of slippery that is in
 

8421
02:40:04,279 --> 02:40:06,469
different variety of slippery that is in
the jungle floor is fasinating cuz some

8422
02:40:06,469 --> 02:40:06,479
the jungle floor is fasinating cuz some
 

8423
02:40:06,479 --> 02:40:09,750
the jungle floor is fasinating cuz some
things I mean the slope matters but some

8424
02:40:09,750 --> 02:40:09,760
things I mean the slope matters but some
 

8425
02:40:09,760 --> 02:40:13,269
things I mean the slope matters but some
roots of trees are slippery some are not

8426
02:40:13,269 --> 02:40:13,279
roots of trees are slippery some are not
 

8427
02:40:13,279 --> 02:40:15,349
roots of trees are slippery some are not
uh some trees in the ground already

8428
02:40:15,349 --> 02:40:15,359
uh some trees in the ground already
 

8429
02:40:15,359 --> 02:40:16,710
uh some trees in the ground already
rotted through so if you step through

8430
02:40:16,710 --> 02:40:16,720
rotted through so if you step through
 

8431
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:19,429
rotted through so if you step through
you're going to uh potentially fall

8432
02:40:19,429 --> 02:40:19,439
you're going to uh potentially fall
 

8433
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:22,230
you're going to uh potentially fall
through so it could be a a shallow hole

8434
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:22,240
through so it could be a a shallow hole
 

8435
02:40:22,240 --> 02:40:24,269
through so it could be a a shallow hole
or it could be a very deep hole with

8436
02:40:24,269 --> 02:40:24,279
or it could be a very deep hole with
 

8437
02:40:24,279 --> 02:40:27,349
or it could be a very deep hole with
some leaves and vegetation covering up a

8438
02:40:27,349 --> 02:40:27,359
some leaves and vegetation covering up a
 

8439
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:29,349
some leaves and vegetation covering up a
hole where if you fall through you could

8440
02:40:29,349 --> 02:40:29,359
hole where if you fall through you could
 

8441
02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:30,790
hole where if you fall through you could
break a leg and completely lose your

8442
02:40:30,790 --> 02:40:30,800
break a leg and completely lose your
 

8443
02:40:30,800 --> 02:40:33,750
break a leg and completely lose your
footing or fall rolling down hill and if

8444
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:33,760
footing or fall rolling down hill and if
 

8445
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:36,110
footing or fall rolling down hill and if
you roll downhill I'm I'm pretty sure

8446
02:40:36,110 --> 02:40:36,120
you roll downhill I'm I'm pretty sure
 

8447
02:40:36,120 --> 02:40:37,630
you roll downhill I'm I'm pretty sure
there's a

8448
02:40:37,630 --> 02:40:37,640
there's a
 

8449
02:40:37,640 --> 02:40:39,950
there's a
99% probability that you'll hit a thing

8450
02:40:39,950 --> 02:40:39,960
99% probability that you'll hit a thing
 

8451
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:43,510
99% probability that you'll hit a thing
with spikes on it so there's so many

8452
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:43,520
with spikes on it so there's so many
 

8453
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:47,309
with spikes on it so there's so many
layers of avoiding dangers of small

8454
02:40:47,309 --> 02:40:47,319
layers of avoiding dangers of small
 

8455
02:40:47,319 --> 02:40:49,030
layers of avoiding dangers of small
dangers and big dangers all around you

8456
02:40:49,030 --> 02:40:49,040
dangers and big dangers all around you
 

8457
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:51,030
dangers and big dangers all around you
with every single step so there's like a

8458
02:40:51,030 --> 02:40:51,040
with every single step so there's like a
 

8459
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:53,469
with every single step so there's like a
mental exhaustion that sets in like the

8460
02:40:53,469 --> 02:40:53,479
mental exhaustion that sets in like the
 

8461
02:40:53,479 --> 02:40:55,950
mental exhaustion that sets in like the
just the perception and you're just

8462
02:40:55,950 --> 02:40:55,960
just the perception and you're just
 

8463
02:40:55,960 --> 02:40:59,349
just the perception and you're just
observing you you're extremely good at

8464
02:40:59,349 --> 02:40:59,359
observing you you're extremely good at
 

8465
02:40:59,359 --> 02:41:02,150
observing you you're extremely good at
perceiving having situational awareness

8466
02:41:02,150 --> 02:41:02,160
perceiving having situational awareness
 

8467
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:03,630
perceiving having situational awareness
of taking the information in that's

8468
02:41:03,630 --> 02:41:03,640
of taking the information in that's
 

8469
02:41:03,640 --> 02:41:05,110
of taking the information in that's
really important and filtering out the

8470
02:41:05,110 --> 02:41:05,120
really important and filtering out the
 

8471
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:07,110
really important and filtering out the
stuff that's not important but even for

8472
02:41:07,110 --> 02:41:07,120
stuff that's not important but even for
 

8473
02:41:07,120 --> 02:41:08,670
stuff that's not important but even for
you that's exhausting and for me it was

8474
02:41:08,670 --> 02:41:08,680
you that's exhausting and for me it was
 

8475
02:41:08,680 --> 02:41:10,389
you that's exhausting and for me it was
completely exhausting just paying

8476
02:41:10,389 --> 02:41:10,399
completely exhausting just paying
 

8477
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:12,429
completely exhausting just paying
attention paying attention to everything

8478
02:41:12,429 --> 02:41:12,439
attention paying attention to everything
 

8479
02:41:12,439 --> 02:41:14,590
attention paying attention to everything
around you so that exhaustion was

8480
02:41:14,590 --> 02:41:14,600
around you so that exhaustion was
 

8481
02:41:14,600 --> 02:41:17,110
around you so that exhaustion was
surprising cuz it's like there there's

8482
02:41:17,110 --> 02:41:17,120
surprising cuz it's like there there's
 

8483
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:18,510
surprising cuz it's like there there's
moments when you're like I don't give a

8484
02:41:18,510 --> 02:41:18,520
moments when you're like I don't give a
 

8485
02:41:18,520 --> 02:41:20,750
moments when you're like I don't give a
damn anymore I'm just going to step I'm

8486
02:41:20,750 --> 02:41:20,760
damn anymore I'm just going to step I'm
 

8487
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:22,750
damn anymore I'm just going to step I'm
just going to like and so that's it you

8488
02:41:22,750 --> 02:41:22,760
just going to like and so that's it you
 

8489
02:41:22,760 --> 02:41:24,230
just going to like and so that's it you
go I don't care anymore and you reach

8490
02:41:24,230 --> 02:41:24,240
go I don't care anymore and you reach
 

8491
02:41:24,240 --> 02:41:25,389
go I don't care anymore and you reach
out and you I'm just going to lean

8492
02:41:25,389 --> 02:41:25,399
out and you I'm just going to lean
 

8493
02:41:25,399 --> 02:41:28,190
out and you I'm just going to lean
against this tree and then what happened

8494
02:41:28,190 --> 02:41:28,200
against this tree and then what happened
 

8495
02:41:28,200 --> 02:41:30,790
against this tree and then what happened
and spikes in it yeah and then you have

8496
02:41:30,790 --> 02:41:30,800
and spikes in it yeah and then you have
 

8497
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:33,070
and spikes in it yeah and then you have
to care yeah and then there's just bad

8498
02:41:33,070 --> 02:41:33,080
to care yeah and then there's just bad
 

8499
02:41:33,080 --> 02:41:35,070
to care yeah and then there's just bad
luck because there is wasp nest there

8500
02:41:35,070 --> 02:41:35,080
luck because there is wasp nest there
 

8501
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:36,510
luck because there is wasp nest there
there is there's just like a million

8502
02:41:36,510 --> 02:41:36,520
there is there's just like a million
 

8503
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:38,469
there is there's just like a million
things and that is physically is

8504
02:41:38,469 --> 02:41:38,479
things and that is physically is
 

8505
02:41:38,479 --> 02:41:40,230
things and that is physically is
mentally psychologically exhausting

8506
02:41:40,230 --> 02:41:40,240
mentally psychologically exhausting
 

8507
02:41:40,240 --> 02:41:41,710
mentally psychologically exhausting
because there's the uncertainty when is

8508
02:41:41,710 --> 02:41:41,720
because there's the uncertainty when is
 

8509
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:44,590
because there's the uncertainty when is
this going to end it's up uh in our

8510
02:41:44,590 --> 02:41:44,600
this going to end it's up uh in our
 

8511
02:41:44,600 --> 02:41:46,469
this going to end it's up uh in our
particular situation up and down Hills

8512
02:41:46,469 --> 02:41:46,479
particular situation up and down Hills
 

8513
02:41:46,479 --> 02:41:48,830
particular situation up and down Hills
up and down Hills very steep downward

8514
02:41:48,830 --> 02:41:48,840
up and down Hills very steep downward
 

8515
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:51,230
up and down Hills very steep downward
very steep SE B Port no water all this

8516
02:41:51,230 --> 02:41:51,240
very steep SE B Port no water all this
 

8517
02:41:51,240 --> 02:41:53,790
very steep SE B Port no water all this
kind of stuff it it's uh the most

8518
02:41:53,790 --> 02:41:53,800
kind of stuff it it's uh the most
 

8519
02:41:53,800 --> 02:41:55,990
kind of stuff it it's uh the most
difficult thing I've ever done but it's

8520
02:41:55,990 --> 02:41:56,000
difficult thing I've ever done but it's
 

8521
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:57,670
difficult thing I've ever done but it's
very difficult to describe what are the

8522
02:41:57,670 --> 02:41:57,680
very difficult to describe what are the
 

8523
02:41:57,680 --> 02:41:59,389
very difficult to describe what are the
parameters that make it difficult

8524
02:41:59,389 --> 02:41:59,399
parameters that make it difficult
 

8525
02:41:59,399 --> 02:42:01,389
parameters that make it difficult
because I I run long distances very

8526
02:42:01,389 --> 02:42:01,399
because I I run long distances very
 

8527
02:42:01,399 --> 02:42:02,950
because I I run long distances very
regular I do extremely difficult

8528
02:42:02,950 --> 02:42:02,960
regular I do extremely difficult
 

8529
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:05,030
regular I do extremely difficult
physical things

8530
02:42:05,030 --> 02:42:05,040
physical things
 

8531
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:07,469
physical things
regularly that on some surface level

8532
02:42:07,469 --> 02:42:07,479
regularly that on some surface level
 

8533
02:42:07,479 --> 02:42:09,349
regularly that on some surface level
could seem much more challenging than

8534
02:42:09,349 --> 02:42:09,359
could seem much more challenging than
 

8535
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:11,950
could seem much more challenging than
what we did but no this was another

8536
02:42:11,950 --> 02:42:11,960
what we did but no this was another
 

8537
02:42:11,960 --> 02:42:14,870
what we did but no this was another
Beast this is something else but it was

8538
02:42:14,870 --> 02:42:14,880
Beast this is something else but it was
 

8539
02:42:14,880 --> 02:42:17,830
Beast this is something else but it was
also raw and real and Beautiful cuz it's

8540
02:42:17,830 --> 02:42:17,840
also raw and real and Beautiful cuz it's
 

8541
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:21,429
also raw and real and Beautiful cuz it's
like it's what the Explorers did yeah

8542
02:42:21,429 --> 02:42:21,439
like it's what the Explorers did yeah
 

8543
02:42:21,439 --> 02:42:23,950
like it's what the Explorers did yeah
it's what Earth is without

8544
02:42:23,950 --> 02:42:23,960
it's what Earth is without
 

8545
02:42:23,960 --> 02:42:26,990
it's what Earth is without
humans and and also just like the

8546
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:27,000
humans and and also just like the
 

8547
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:30,630
humans and and also just like the
massive scale of the trees around

8548
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:30,640
massive scale of the trees around
 

8549
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:35,389
massive scale of the trees around
us was uh The Humbling size difference

8550
02:42:35,389 --> 02:42:35,399
us was uh The Humbling size difference
 

8551
02:42:35,399 --> 02:42:38,870
us was uh The Humbling size difference
between human and tree it's both

8552
02:42:38,870 --> 02:42:38,880
between human and tree it's both
 

8553
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:40,710
between human and tree it's both
humbling and that like that tree is

8554
02:42:40,710 --> 02:42:40,720
humbling and that like that tree is
 

8555
02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:44,469
humbling and that like that tree is
really old it's it's a time difference

8556
02:42:44,469 --> 02:42:44,479
really old it's it's a time difference
 

8557
02:42:44,479 --> 02:42:48,110
really old it's it's a time difference
uh lifetime difference and just the

8558
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:48,120
uh lifetime difference and just the
 

8559
02:42:48,120 --> 02:42:50,469
uh lifetime difference and just the
scale it's like holy

8560
02:42:50,469 --> 02:42:50,479
scale it's like holy
 

8561
02:42:50,479 --> 02:42:53,309
scale it's like holy
shit we live on an earth that can create

8562
02:42:53,309 --> 02:42:53,319
shit we live on an earth that can create
 

8563
02:42:53,319 --> 02:42:55,550
shit we live on an earth that can create
those things makes me feel small in

8564
02:42:55,550 --> 02:42:55,560
those things makes me feel small in
 

8565
02:42:55,560 --> 02:42:58,389
those things makes me feel small in
every way that life is

8566
02:42:58,389 --> 02:42:58,399
every way that life is
 

8567
02:42:58,399 --> 02:43:01,150
every way that life is
short that my physical presence on this

8568
02:43:01,150 --> 02:43:01,160
short that my physical presence on this
 

8569
02:43:01,160 --> 02:43:04,269
short that my physical presence on this
Earth is Tiny how vulnerable I am all

8570
02:43:04,269 --> 02:43:04,279
Earth is Tiny how vulnerable I am all
 

8571
02:43:04,279 --> 02:43:06,750
Earth is Tiny how vulnerable I am all
those feelings were there and in that

8572
02:43:06,750 --> 02:43:06,760
those feelings were there and in that
 

8573
02:43:06,760 --> 02:43:10,429
those feelings were there and in that
the physical uh endurance of traversing

8574
02:43:10,429 --> 02:43:10,439
the physical uh endurance of traversing
 

8575
02:43:10,439 --> 02:43:11,710
the physical uh endurance of traversing
the

8576
02:43:11,710 --> 02:43:11,720
the
 

8577
02:43:11,720 --> 02:43:14,070
the
jungle yeah was

8578
02:43:14,070 --> 02:43:14,080
jungle yeah was
 

8579
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,670
jungle yeah was
the the hardest Journey that I remember

8580
02:43:16,670 --> 02:43:16,680
the the hardest Journey that I remember
 

8581
02:43:16,680 --> 02:43:20,230
the the hardest Journey that I remember
ever taking

8582
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:20,240

 

8583
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:21,870

every

8584
02:43:21,870 --> 02:43:21,880
every
 

8585
02:43:21,880 --> 02:43:24,990
every
step and then that made making it out of

8586
02:43:24,990 --> 02:43:25,000
step and then that made making it out of
 

8587
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:25,790
step and then that made making it out of
the

8588
02:43:25,790 --> 02:43:25,800
the
 

8589
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:30,710
the
Jungle and then made

8590
02:43:30,710 --> 02:43:30,720

 

8591
02:43:30,720 --> 02:43:34,710

it the swim in the water that we could

8592
02:43:34,710 --> 02:43:34,720
it the swim in the water that we could
 

8593
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:39,429
it the swim in the water that we could
drink that was just pure

8594
02:43:39,429 --> 02:43:39,439

 

8595
02:43:39,439 --> 02:43:42,830

joy it was probably one of the happiest

8596
02:43:42,830 --> 02:43:42,840
joy it was probably one of the happiest
 

8597
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:45,990
joy it was probably one of the happiest
moments in my life just sitting there

8598
02:43:45,990 --> 02:43:46,000
moments in my life just sitting there
 

8599
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:47,269
moments in my life just sitting there
with

8600

02:43:59,590 --> 02:43:59,600
and all just us all just laughing having
 

8607
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:02,309
and all just us all just laughing having
made it through

8608
02:44:02,309 --> 02:44:02,319
made it through
 

8609
02:44:02,319 --> 02:44:05,349
made it through
that having eaten a bit of food before

8610
02:44:05,349 --> 02:44:05,359
that having eaten a bit of food before
 

8611
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:07,230
that having eaten a bit of food before
and the absurdity of the timing of all

8612
02:44:07,230 --> 02:44:07,240
and the absurdity of the timing of all
 

8613
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:10,990
and the absurdity of the timing of all
of it that it somehow worked

8614
02:44:10,990 --> 02:44:11,000
of it that it somehow worked
 

8615
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,790
of it that it somehow worked
out

8616
02:44:13,790 --> 02:44:13,800
out
 

8617
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:19,950
out
and how we're just three little humans

8618
02:44:19,950 --> 02:44:19,960
and how we're just three little humans
 

8619
02:44:19,960 --> 02:44:21,670
and how we're just three little humans
sitting in a

8620
02:44:21,670 --> 02:44:21,680
sitting in a
 

8621
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:25,269
sitting in a
river just our heads emerged barely

8622
02:44:25,269 --> 02:44:25,279
river just our heads emerged barely
 

8623
02:44:25,279 --> 02:44:28,670
river just our heads emerged barely
above water with jungle all around us

8624
02:44:28,670 --> 02:44:28,680
above water with jungle all around us
 

8625
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:29,590
above water with jungle all around us
what a

8626

02:53:57,120 --> 02:53:59,309
through the jungle I think it's all
there is if you hear about the people

there is if you hear about the people
 

9121
02:53:59,319 --> 02:54:00,870
there is if you hear about the people
and and and I think that that is a

it I mean that's that's I think that's

9148
02:54:30,870 --> 02:54:30,880
it I mean that's that's I think that's

it I mean that's that's I think that's
our quality as a human so they also

9150
02:54:33,910 --> 02:54:33,920
our quality as a human so they also
 

9151
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:36,190
our quality as a human so they also
mapped so on the biology side is

9152
02:54:36,190 --> 02:54:36,200
mapped so on the biology side is
 

9153
02:54:36,200 --> 02:54:38,510
mapped so on the biology side is
interesting but they mapped and document

9154
02:54:38,510 --> 02:54:38,520
interesting but they mapped and document
 

9155
02:54:38,520 --> 02:54:39,910
interesting but they mapped and document
a lot of the unknown geography and

9156
02:54:39,910 --> 02:54:39,920
a lot of the unknown geography and
 

9157
02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:41,750
a lot of the unknown geography and
biodiversity what does it take to do

9158
02:54:41,750 --> 02:54:41,760
biodiversity what does it take to do
 

9159
02:54:41,760 --> 02:54:43,590
biodiversity what does it take to do
that so when I when I see move about the

9160
02:54:43,590 --> 02:54:43,600
that so when I when I see move about the
 

9161
02:54:43,600 --> 02:54:45,750
that so when I when I see move about the
jungle you're always like you capture in

creature you take a picture right down

9164
02:54:47,349 --> 02:54:47,359
creature you take a picture right down
 

9165
02:54:47,359 --> 02:54:49,389
creature you take a picture right down
like so you can

9166
02:54:49,389 --> 02:54:49,399
like so you can
 

9167
02:54:49,399 --> 02:54:51,950
like so you can
find new creatures find new things about

9168
02:54:51,950 --> 02:54:51,960
find new creatures find new things about
 

9169
02:54:51,960 --> 02:54:54,229
find new creatures find new things about
the jungle document them sort of a

9170
02:54:54,229 --> 02:54:54,239
the jungle document them sort of a
 

9171
02:54:54,239 --> 02:54:57,429
the jungle document them sort of a
scientific perspective on the jungle but

9172
02:54:57,429 --> 02:54:57,439
scientific perspective on the jungle but
 

9173
02:54:57,439 --> 02:54:59,670
scientific perspective on the jungle but
the back then there's even less known

9174
02:54:59,670 --> 02:54:59,680
the back then there's even less known
 

9175
02:54:59,680 --> 02:55:02,150
the back then there's even less known
much less known about the jungle so what

9176
02:55:02,150 --> 02:55:02,160
much less known about the jungle so what
 

9177
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:03,510
much less known about the jungle so what
what do you think it takes to document

9178
02:55:03,510 --> 02:55:03,520
what do you think it takes to document
 

9179
02:55:03,520 --> 02:55:06,870
what do you think it takes to document
to map that world and you un explored

9180
02:55:06,870 --> 02:55:06,880
to map that world and you un explored
 

9181
02:55:06,880 --> 02:55:09,070
to map that world and you un explored
Wilderness I I mean they're they're

birds and and and Roosevelt knew how to

9188
02:55:17,070 --> 02:55:17,080
birds and and and Roosevelt knew how to
 

9189
02:55:17,080 --> 02:55:19,710
birds and and and Roosevelt knew how to
knew how to preserve those specimens I

9190
02:55:19,710 --> 02:55:19,720
knew how to preserve those specimens I
 

9191
02:55:19,720 --> 02:55:21,469
knew how to preserve those specimens I
mean he really was a naturalist so he

9192
02:55:21,469 --> 02:55:21,479
mean he really was a naturalist so he
 

9193
02:55:21,479 --> 02:55:22,750
mean he really was a naturalist so he
knew exactly so if he's seeing these

9194
02:55:22,750 --> 02:55:22,760
knew exactly so if he's seeing these
 

9195
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:24,830
knew exactly so if he's seeing these
animals to them where whereas we'll take

9196
02:55:24,830 --> 02:55:24,840
animals to them where whereas we'll take
 

9197
02:55:24,840 --> 02:55:26,550
animals to them where whereas we'll take
a picture and identify it they were

9198
02:55:26,550 --> 02:55:26,560
a picture and identify it they were
 

9199
02:55:26,560 --> 02:55:28,389
a picture and identify it they were
harvesting specimens taking them with

9200
02:55:28,389 --> 02:55:28,399
harvesting specimens taking them with
 

9201
02:55:28,399 --> 02:55:31,950
harvesting specimens taking them with
them drying them out um for them it was

9202
02:55:31,950 --> 02:55:31,960
them drying them out um for them it was
 

9203
02:55:31,960 --> 02:55:33,349
them drying them out um for them it was
totally different and and it could be

9204
02:55:33,349 --> 02:55:33,359
totally different and and it could be
 

9205
02:55:33,359 --> 02:55:35,870
totally different and and it could be
the first you know there's I don't know

9206
02:55:35,870 --> 02:55:35,880
the first you know there's I don't know
 

9207
02:55:35,880 --> 02:55:37,269
the first you know there's I don't know
I forget what JJ said there's something

9208
02:55:37,269 --> 02:55:37,279
I forget what JJ said there's something
 

9209
02:55:37,279 --> 02:55:39,429
I forget what JJ said there's something
like 70 species of ant Birds here and

9210
02:55:39,429 --> 02:55:39,439
like 70 species of ant Birds here and
 

9211
02:55:39,439 --> 02:55:41,550
like 70 species of ant Birds here and
it's like so How likely are you to be

9212
02:55:41,550 --> 02:55:41,560
it's like so How likely are you to be
 

9213
02:55:41,560 --> 02:55:43,990
it's like so How likely are you to be
the first person to ever see this one

9214
02:55:43,990 --> 02:55:44,000
the first person to ever see this one
 

9215
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,150
the first person to ever see this one
species of bird and so for

9216
02:55:46,150 --> 02:55:46,160
species of bird and so for
 

9217
02:55:46,160 --> 02:55:49,630
species of bird and so for
them and it's you have this bird and so

9218
02:55:49,630 --> 02:55:49,640
them and it's you have this bird and so
 

9219
02:55:49,640 --> 02:55:52,070
them and it's you have this bird and so
perfectly preserving that specimen and I

9220
02:55:52,070 --> 02:55:52,080
perfectly preserving that specimen and I
 

9221
02:55:52,080 --> 02:55:53,590
perfectly preserving that specimen and I
think a lot of non-scientific people

9222
02:55:53,590 --> 02:55:53,600
think a lot of non-scientific people
 

9223
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:55,710
think a lot of non-scientific people
don't realize that every species from

9224
02:55:55,710 --> 02:55:55,720
don't realize that every species from
 

9225
02:55:55,720 --> 02:55:58,790
don't realize that every species from
blue whale to Elephant to Blue Jay to

species we have on record there are

9230
02:56:02,790 --> 02:56:02,800
species we have on record there are
 

9231
02:56:02,800 --> 02:56:04,269
species we have on record there are
scientific specimens and the first

9232
02:56:04,269 --> 02:56:04,279
scientific specimens and the first
 

9233
02:56:04,279 --> 02:56:07,229
scientific specimens and the first
people to see them shot them mhm and

9234
02:56:07,229 --> 02:56:07,239
people to see them shot them mhm and
 

9235
02:56:07,239 --> 02:56:10,110
people to see them shot them mhm and
that's there museums are filled with

9236
02:56:10,110 --> 02:56:10,120
that's there museums are filled with
 

9237
02:56:10,120 --> 02:56:12,429
that's there museums are filled with
these cataloged preserved birds that

9238
02:56:12,429 --> 02:56:12,439
these cataloged preserved birds that
 

9239
02:56:12,439 --> 02:56:14,830
these cataloged preserved birds that
these explorers brought back from New

9240
02:56:14,830 --> 02:56:14,840
these explorers brought back from New
 

9241
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:16,910
these explorers brought back from New
Guinea and South America and Africa and

02:56:16,910 --> 02:56:16,920
Guinea and South America and Africa and
 

9243
02:56:16,920 --> 02:56:20,389
Guinea and South America and Africa and
then put into these dra and and and now

9244
02:56:20,389 --> 02:56:20,399
then put into these dra and and and now
 

9245
02:56:20,399 --> 02:56:22,469

of the show they literally said you

9582
03:02:47,670 --> 03:02:47,680
of the show they literally said you
 

9583

100

9586
03:02:52,670 --> 03:02:52,680
100
 

9587
03:02:52,680 --> 03:02:55,550
100
days and and that's there's a lot of

9588
03:02:55,550 --> 03:02:55,560
days and and that's there's a lot of
 

9589
03:02:55,560 --> 03:02:57,830
days and and that's there's a lot of
aspects of that show that's difficult

9590
03:02:57,830 --> 03:02:57,840
aspects of that show that's difficult
 

9591
03:02:57,840 --> 03:02:59,750
aspects of that show that's difficult
one of which is it's in the

9592
03:02:59,750 --> 03:02:59,760
one of which is it's in the
 

9593
03:02:59,760 --> 03:03:02,229
one of which is it's in the
cold the others they get just a handful

9594
03:03:02,229 --> 03:03:02,239
cold the others they get just a handful

of supplies no food nothing none of that

9598
03:03:08,030 --> 03:03:08,040
so they have to figure all of that out
 

9599
03:03:08,040 --> 03:03:10,750
so they have to figure all of that out
and um this is probably one of the

9600
03:03:10,750 --> 03:03:10,760
and um this is probably one of the
 

9601
03:03:10,760 --> 03:03:13,030
and um this is probably one of the

faucet referenced either the Les pedras

10120

and people have stepped up and begun to
 

10353
03:18:05,199 --> 03:18:06,710
and people have stepped up and begun to
make that happen and there people from

make that happen and there people from
 

10355
03:18:06,720 --> 03:18:09,389
make that happen and there people from
all over the world and it's

all over the world and it's
 

10357
03:18:09,399 --> 03:18:12,990
all over the world and it's
incredible but what's the approach so

10358
03:18:12,990 --> 03:18:13,000
incredible but what's the approach so
 

10359
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:15,510
incredible but what's the approach so
trying to with donations to buy out more

10360
03:18:15,510 --> 03:18:15,520
trying to with donations to buy out more
 

10361
03:18:15,520 --> 03:18:18,150
trying to with donations to buy out more
and more of the land and then protect it

10362
03:18:18,150 --> 03:18:18,160
and more of the land and then protect it
 

10363
03:18:18,160 --> 03:18:19,590
and more of the land and then protect it
so the approach is that currently the

10364
03:18:19,590 --> 03:18:19,600
so the approach is that currently the
 

10365
03:18:19,600 --> 03:18:21,750
so the approach is that currently the
government favors extractors so if

10366
03:18:21,750 --> 03:18:21,760
government favors extractors so if
 

10367
03:18:21,760 --> 03:18:25,750
government favors extractors so if

burn a bunch of rainforest and set up a
 

10373
03:18:30,479 --> 03:18:32,790
burn a bunch of rainforest and set up a
