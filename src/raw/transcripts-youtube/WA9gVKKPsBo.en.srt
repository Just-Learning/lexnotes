your comfort zone or push your abilities
 

215
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,990

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,350
get to a position where
you you don't feel that uncomfort it's

226

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:40,360
expect you're going to mess up here and
 

231
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,590

the um the Moose the first moose I saw I
 

235
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,510
the um the Moose the first moose I saw I
had a great shot at it but I had a hard

236
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:48,520
had a great shot at it but I had a hard
 

237
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,150
had a great shot at it but I had a hard
time judging distance because it was in

238
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
time judging distance because it was in
 

239
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,670
time judging distance because it was in
a mud flat which means it's hard to it's

240
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
a mud flat which means it's hard to it's
 

241
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,550
a mud flat which means it's hard to it's
hard to tell yardage you know some

242
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:55,560
hard to tell yardage you know some
 

243
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,830
hard to tell yardage you know some
because you're usually typically going

244
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:56,840
because you're usually typically going
 

245
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,790
because you're usually typically going
by trees or markers be like Oh I'm

and I estimated that he was 30 something
yards away so I was way off and shot and

wanding along and I was able to get it

314
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,000
wanding along and I was able to get it
 

315
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,270
wanding along and I was able to get it
but being able to take failure as soon

316
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
but being able to take failure as soon
 

317
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,070
but being able to take failure as soon
as you can the better accept it and then

318
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
as you can the better accept it and then
 

319
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,830
as you can the better accept it and then
learn from it is kind of a muscle you

320
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:20,840
learn from it is kind of a muscle you
 

321
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,110
learn from it is kind of a muscle you
have to exercise a little bit well it's

322
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
have to exercise a little bit well it's
 

323
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,790
have to exercise a little bit well it's
interesting cuz in this case the cost of

324
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
interesting cuz in this case the cost of
 

325
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,550
interesting cuz in this case the cost of
failure is like you're not going to be

326
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
failure is like you're not going to be
 

327
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,070
failure is like you're not going to be
able to eat yeah that that was really I

328
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
able to eat yeah that that was really I
 

329
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,710
able to eat yeah that that was really I
mean the the most interesting thing

330
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
mean the the most interesting thing
 

331
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,830
mean the the most interesting thing
about that show was how high the stakes

332
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:34,840
about that show was how high the stakes
 

333
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,430
about that show was how high the stakes
felt because it didn't feel you know you

334
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,440
felt because it didn't feel you know you
 

335
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,110
felt because it didn't feel you know you
didn't tell yourself you're on a show at

336
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,120
didn't tell yourself you're on a show at
 

337
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,990
didn't tell yourself you're on a show at
least I didn't you just felt like it was

338
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
least I didn't you just felt like it was
 

339
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,350
least I didn't you just felt like it was
you're going to starve to death if you

340
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
you're going to starve to death if you
 

341
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,870
you're going to starve to death if you
don't make this happen and so the stakes

342
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:43,880
don't make this happen and so the stakes
 

343
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,150
don't make this happen and so the stakes
felt so high and and um it was an

344
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,160
felt so high and and um it was an
 

345
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,270
felt so high and and um it was an
interesting thing to tap into because I

346
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:50,280
interesting thing to tap into because I
 

347
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,909
interesting thing to tap into because I
mean so many of our ancestors probably

348
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:51,919
mean so many of our ancestors probably
 

349
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,749
mean so many of our ancestors probably
all just dealt with that on a regular

350
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
all just dealt with that on a regular
 

351
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,110
all just dealt with that on a regular
basis but it's something that we all all

352
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,120
basis but it's something that we all all
 

353
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,869
basis but it's something that we all all
the modern amenities and such and food

354
00:06:58,869 --> 00:06:58,879
the modern amenities and such and food
 

355
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,589
the modern amenities and such and food
security that we don't deal with and uh

356
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
security that we don't deal with and uh
 

357
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,469
security that we don't deal with and uh
it was interesting to tap into what a

358
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
it was interesting to tap into what a
 

359
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,950
it was interesting to tap into what a
kind of a peak mental experience that is

360
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
kind of a peak mental experience that is
 

361
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,430
kind of a peak mental experience that is
when you really really need something to

362
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
when you really really need something to
 

363
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,869
when you really really need something to
survive and then it happens it's you

364
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:11,879
survive and then it happens it's you
 

365
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,670
survive and then it happens it's you
can't imagine I mean that's what our all

366
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
can't imagine I mean that's what our all
 

367
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,629
can't imagine I mean that's what our all
our dopamine and receptors are tuned for

368
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:17,639
our dopamine and receptors are tuned for
 

369
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,070
our dopamine and receptors are tuned for
that experience in particular so it was

370
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,080
that experience in particular so it was
 

371
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,710
that experience in particular so it was
yeah it was pretty awesome but the

372
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
yeah it was pretty awesome but the
 

373
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,189
yeah it was pretty awesome but the
pressure felt very on like I I always

374
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
pressure felt very on like I I always
 

375
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,830
pressure felt very on like I I always
felt the pressure of of providing or

376
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
felt the pressure of of providing or
 

377
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,950
felt the pressure of of providing or
starving and then there's a situation

378
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
starving and then there's a situation
 

379
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,309
starving and then there's a situation
when you left the ladder up right and

380
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:33,319
when you left the ladder up right and
 

381
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,110
when you left the ladder up right and
you needed fat and uh what is it the

382
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,120
you needed fat and uh what is it the
 

383
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,550
you needed fat and uh what is it the
Wolverine ate some of the fat right yeah

384
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:38,560
Wolverine ate some of the fat right yeah
 

385
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,350
Wolverine ate some of the fat right yeah
well it was when I got the Moose I was

386
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
well it was when I got the Moose I was
 

387
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,430

so happy the most Joy I could almost

388
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
so happy the most Joy I could almost
 

389
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,710
so happy the most Joy I could almost
experience Max maxed out but I didn't

390
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:46,720
experience Max maxed out but I didn't
 

391
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,110
experience Max maxed out but I didn't
think I uh I didn't think I won at that

392

think I uh I didn't think I won at that
point I never thought like oh that's my

394
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:51,720
point I never thought like oh that's my
 

395
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,469
point I never thought like oh that's my
ticket to Victory I thought holy crap

396
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
ticket to Victory I thought holy crap
 

397
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,830
ticket to Victory I thought holy crap
it's going to be me against somebody

00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
it's going to be me against somebody
 

399
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,149
it's going to be me against somebody

407
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,189

I've got to like I've got to outproduce

408
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
I've got to like I've got to outproduce
 

409
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,309
I've got to like I've got to outproduce
somebody else with a moose so I had all

410
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:07,319
somebody else with a moose so I had all
 

411
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,830
somebody else with a moose so I had all
that in my head and I already was of

412
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
that in my head and I already was of
 

413
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,149
that in my head and I already was of
course pretty thin and and so I was just

414
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:12,159
course pretty thin and and so I was just
 

415
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,029
course pretty thin and and so I was just
like man somebody else gets a moose I'm

416
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:14,039
like man somebody else gets a moose I'm

00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:15,319
still going to be behind and so
 

419
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,230
still going to be behind and so
everything felt like precious to me and

420
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
everything felt like precious to me and
 

421
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,390
everything felt like precious to me and
I had found a plastic jug and I put a

422
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
I had found a plastic jug and I put a
 

423
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,189
I had found a plastic jug and I put a
whole bunch of the moose's fat in this

424
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:22,199
whole bunch of the moose's fat in this
 

425
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,830
whole bunch of the moose's fat in this
plastic jug and set it up on a little

426
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
plastic jug and set it up on a little
 

427
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,950
plastic jug and set it up on a little
shelf I thought you know what if a bear

428
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:25,960
shelf I thought you know what if a bear
 

429
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,189
shelf I thought you know what if a bear
comes I'll probably hear it and I'll

430
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
comes I'll probably hear it and I'll
 

431
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,510
comes I'll probably hear it and I'll
come out and be able to shoot it so I

432
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
come out and be able to shoot it so I
 

433
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,869
come out and be able to shoot it so I
went to sleep and I woke up the next

434
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
went to sleep and I woke up the next
 

435
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,110
went to sleep and I woke up the next
morning and I went out and I was like

436
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,120
morning and I went out and I was like
 

437
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,389
morning and I went out and I was like
where's that jug started and then I was

438
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:35,399
where's that jug started and then I was
 

439
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,550
where's that jug started and then I was
like wait a second what are all these

440
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
like wait a second what are all these
 

441
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,909
like wait a second what are all these
prints and I started looking around and

442
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:38,919
prints and I started looking around and
 

443
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,630
prints and I started looking around and
it took a second to dawn on me because I

444
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
it took a second to dawn on me because I
 

445
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,750
it took a second to dawn on me because I
haven't interacted with wol Wolverines

446
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:42,760
haven't interacted with wol Wolverines
 

447
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,949
haven't interacted with wol Wolverines
very often in life and uh I was like oh

448
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:45,959
very often in life and uh I was like oh
 

449
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,630
very often in life and uh I was like oh
those are Wolverine tracks and he was

450
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:47,640
those are Wolverine tracks and he was
 

451
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,550
those are Wolverine tracks and he was
just so much sneakier than bear would

452
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:49,560
just so much sneakier than bear would
 

453
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,670
just so much sneakier than bear would
have been or something so it kind of

454
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:50,680
have been or something so it kind of
 

455
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,910
have been or something so it kind of
surprised me and he took off with that

456
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:52,920
surprised me and he took off with that
 

457
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,150
surprised me and he took off with that
jug of fat and so then I went from

458
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,160
jug of fat and so then I went from
 

459
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,550
jug of fat and so then I went from
feeling pretty good about myself to like

460
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:57,560
feeling pretty good about myself to like
 

461
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,509
feeling pretty good about myself to like
now I'm losing again against whoever you

462
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
now I'm losing again against whoever you
 

463
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,150
now I'm losing again against whoever you
know this other person is with a moose

464
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,160
know this other person is with a moose
 

465
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,230
know this other person is with a moose
so I I again kind of the pressure came

466
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
so I I again kind of the pressure came
 

467
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,670
so I I again kind of the pressure came
back to Oh no I got to produce again you

468
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
back to Oh no I got to produce again you
 

469
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,470
back to Oh no I got to produce again you
know it wasn't the end of the world and

470
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:09,480
know it wasn't the end of the world and
 

471
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,829
know it wasn't the end of the world and
I think they may have exaggerated a

472
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
I think they may have exaggerated a
 

473
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,069
I think they may have exaggerated a
little bit how little fat I had left you

474
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:14,079
little bit how little fat I had left you
 

475
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,590
little bit how little fat I had left you
know I still had there a moose has a lot

476
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,600
know I still had there a moose has a lot
 

477
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,949
know I still had there a moose has a lot
of fat but it did make me feel like I

478
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:17,959
of fat but it did make me feel like I
 

479
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:20,910
of fat but it did make me feel like I
was at a disadvantage again and so yeah

480
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:20,920
was at a disadvantage again and so yeah
 

481
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,670
was at a disadvantage again and so yeah
that was pretty that was pretty intense

482
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:22,680
that was pretty that was pretty intense
 

483
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,030
that was pretty that was pretty intense
cuz those Wolverines they're bold little

484
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,040
cuz those Wolverines they're bold little
 

485

cuz those Wolverines they're bold little
animals and they and he was basically

animals and they and he was basically
saying No this is is my

488
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
saying No this is is my
 

489
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,630
saying No this is is my
moose and I had to counter his claims

490
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
moose and I had to counter his claims
 

491
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,030
moose and I had to counter his claims
well they yeah they're really really

492

well they yeah they're really really
smart they figure out a way to get to

494
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
smart they figure out a way to get to
 

495
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,790
smart they figure out a way to get to
places really effectively Wolverines are

496
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
places really effectively Wolverines are
 

497
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,230
places really effectively Wolverines are

517
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,509
become sustainable so I was like I don't
care if it's a risk I'm going to build

518
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:08,519
care if it's a risk I'm going to build
 

519
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,030
care if it's a risk I'm going to build
that fence I built it I would just pick

520
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
that fence I built it I would just pick

Clank cuz I had set up kind of an alarm
 

541
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,670
Clank cuz I had set up kind of an alarm
system with with string and cans so it's

542
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
system with with string and cans so it's
 

543
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,110
system with with string and cans so it's
a brilliant idea way yeah it's another

544
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,120
a brilliant idea way yeah it's another
 

545
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,230
a brilliant idea way yeah it's another
thing that could have not worked but it

546
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
thing that could have not worked but it
 

547
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,710
thing that could have not worked but it
worked and it came through and I was

548
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
worked and it came through and I was
 

549
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,629
worked and it came through and I was
like oh I heard the cans clink and I was

550
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:46,639
like oh I heard the cans clink and I was
 

551
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,550
like oh I heard the cans clink and I was
like no way and so I ran over I didn't

552
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:48,560
like no way and so I ran over I didn't
 

553
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,069
like no way and so I ran over I didn't
know what it was exactly but something

554
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
know what it was exactly but something
 

555
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,150
know what it was exactly but something
was coming along the fence and I ran

556
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
was coming along the fence and I ran
 

557
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,430
was coming along the fence and I ran
over and jumped in the bush next to the

558
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:54,440
over and jumped in the bush next to the
 

559
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,230
over and jumped in the bush next to the
funnel exit on the fence and sure enough

560
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,240
funnel exit on the fence and sure enough
 

561
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,790
funnel exit on the fence and sure enough
the Big Moose came running up and you

562
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
the Big Moose came running up and you
 

563
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,430
the Big Moose came running up and you
know your gets pounding like crazy

564
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
know your gets pounding like crazy
 

565
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,509
know your gets pounding like crazy
you're like no way no way I probably

566
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
you're like no way no way I probably
 

567
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,190
you're like no way no way I probably
could have waited a little longer and

568
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
could have waited a little longer and
 

569
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,829
could have waited a little longer and
had a perfect broadside shot but I took

570
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
had a perfect broadside shot but I took
 

571
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,870
had a perfect broadside shot but I took
the shot when he was uh he was he was

572
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
the shot when he was uh he was he was
 

573
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,590
the shot when he was uh he was he was
pretty close like 24 yards but he was

574
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
pretty close like 24 yards but he was
 

575
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,470
pretty close like 24 yards but he was
quartering towards me which makes it a

576
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:15,480
quartering towards me which makes it a
 

577
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,310
quartering towards me which makes it a
little harder to make a a perfect Kill

578
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,320
little harder to make a a perfect Kill
 

579
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,150
little harder to make a a perfect Kill
Shot you know and so I hit it and it

580
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,160
Shot you know and so I hit it and it
 

581
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,629
Shot you know and so I hit it and it
took off running and I just thought you

582
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:23,639
took off running and I just thought you
 

583
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,310
took off running and I just thought you
know I was super excited I couldn't

584
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
know I was super excited I couldn't
 

585
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,829
know I was super excited I couldn't
believe I actually you know I was like

586
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
believe I actually you know I was like
 

587
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,750
believe I actually you know I was like
oh my gosh I got the Boost I think that

588
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760
oh my gosh I got the Boost I think that
 

589
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,509
oh my gosh I got the Boost I think that
was a really good shot you get all

590
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
was a really good shot you get all
 

591
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,949
was a really good shot you get all
excited but then it plays back in your

592
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:33,959
excited but then it plays back in your
 

593
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,910
excited but then it plays back in your
head and particularly when you're first

594
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
head and particularly when you're first
 

595
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,110
head and particularly when you're first
learning to hunt there's always an

596
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,120
learning to hunt there's always an
 

597
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,190
learning to hunt there's always an
animal that gets away you know and you

598
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,200
animal that gets away you know and you
 

599
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,750
animal that gets away you know and you
like make a bad decision or not a great

600
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:43,760
like make a bad decision or not a great
 

601
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,310
like make a bad decision or not a great
shot or something and it's just it's

602
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
shot or something and it's just it's
 

603
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,790
shot or something and it's just it's
just part of it and so of course you're

604
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
just part of it and so of course you're
 

605
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,430
just part of it and so of course you're
like I'm not going to be satisfied until

606
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
like I'm not going to be satisfied until
 

607
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,629
like I'm not going to be satisfied until
I see this thing so I followed the blood

608
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
I see this thing so I followed the blood
 

609
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,150
I see this thing so I followed the blood
trail a little while and I saw some

610
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
trail a little while and I saw some
 

611
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,910
trail a little while and I saw some
bubbly blood which meant it was hitting

612
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:57,920
bubbly blood which meant it was hitting
 

613
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,310
bubbly blood which meant it was hitting
the lungs which meant it's not going to

614
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
the lungs which meant it's not going to
 

615
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,509
the lungs which meant it's not going to
live you know you'll get it and so as

616
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:02,519
live you know you'll get it and so as
 

617
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,310
live you know you'll get it and so as
long as you don't mess it up and so I

618
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,320
long as you don't mess it up and so I
 

619
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,990

that's when you lose an animal because

684
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:18,680
that's when you lose an animal because
 

685
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,550
that's when you lose an animal because
as soon as it knows it's being hunted

686
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
as soon as it knows it's being hunted
 

687
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,670
as soon as it knows it's being hunted
you know it gets panicked adrenaline and

688
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:22,680
you know it gets panicked adrenaline and
 

689
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,629
you know it gets panicked adrenaline and
it can just run and run and run and

690
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
it can just run and run and run and
 

691
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,590
it can just run and run and run and
you'll never find it so I didn't want it

692
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:26,600
you'll never find it so I didn't want it
 

693
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,550
you'll never find it so I didn't want it
to see me I knew if I tried to get it

694
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
to see me I knew if I tried to get it
 

695
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,269
to see me I knew if I tried to get it
with another Arrow there's a chance I

696
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:30,279
with another Arrow there's a chance I
 

697
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,430
with another Arrow there's a chance I
could have finished it off but there's

698
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
could have finished it off but there's
 

699
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,350
could have finished it off but there's
also a not bad chance that it would see

700
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
also a not bad chance that it would see
 

701
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,629
also a not bad chance that it would see
me take off or even attack cuz moose can

702
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:37,639
me take off or even attack cuz moose can
 

703
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,310
me take off or even attack cuz moose can
be a little dangerous and so uh I just

704
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
be a little dangerous and so uh I just
 

705
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,990
be a little dangerous and so uh I just
chose to wait it out and at one point it

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
chose to wait it out and at one point it
 

707
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,509
chose to wait it out and at one point it
stood up and fell over and I could tell

shooting a lot so you have like kind of
 

793
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,189
shooting a lot so you have like kind of
a technique like I'm going to go back

touch my face draw my elbow tight and
 

797
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,110
touch my face draw my elbow tight and
then the arrow is going to let loose a

798
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,120
then the arrow is going to let loose a
 

799
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,110
then the arrow is going to let loose a
muscle memory most it's kind of muscle

800
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:34,120
muscle memory most it's kind of muscle
 

801
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,269
muscle memory most it's kind of muscle
memory you have a little trigger like

802
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:36,279
memory you have a little trigger like
 

803
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,749
memory you have a little trigger like
draw That Elbow tight and then and then

804
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
draw That Elbow tight and then and then
 

805
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,790
draw That Elbow tight and then and then
uh then it happens and then you just

806
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:41,800
uh then it happens and then you just
 

807
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,990
uh then it happens and then you just
watch the Arrow and see where it goes

808
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,000
watch the Arrow and see where it goes
 

809
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,509
watch the Arrow and see where it goes
now with the animal you know you try to

810
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
now with the animal you know you try to
 

811
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,629
now with the animal you know you try to
do it ethically that is like make as

00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:47,639
do it ethically that is like make as
 

813
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,150
do it ethically that is like make as
good of a shot as you can make sure it

814
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
good of a shot as you can make sure it
 

815
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,069
good of a shot as you can make sure it
is either hit in the heart or both lungs

816
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:53,079
is either hit in the heart or both lungs
 

817
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,870
is either hit in the heart or both lungs
and when that happens it's a pretty

818
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
and when that happens it's a pretty
 

819
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,110
and when that happens it's a pretty
quick death which is death is a part of

820
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
quick death which is death is a part of
 

821
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,069
quick death which is death is a part of
life and but honestly for a wild animal

822
00:15:59,069 --> 00:15:59,079
life and but honestly for a wild animal
 

823
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:00,749
life and but honestly for a wild animal
that's probably the best way to go they

824
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:00,759
that's probably the best way to go they
 

825
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,590
that's probably the best way to go they
could they could have um now when a

826
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:04,600
could they could have um now when a
 

827
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,150
could they could have um now when a
animal's kind of walking towards you if

828
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,160
animal's kind of walking towards you if
 

829
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,590
animal's kind of walking towards you if
it's walking towards you but not

830
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:08,600
it's walking towards you but not
 

831
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,790
it's walking towards you but not
directly towards you that's what you

832
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:09,800
directly towards you that's what you
 

833
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,430
directly towards you that's what you
call quartering towards you you can

834
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:12,440
call quartering towards you you can
 

835
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,150
call quartering towards you you can
picture it's actually pretty difficult

836
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
picture it's actually pretty difficult
 

837
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,550
picture it's actually pretty difficult
to hit both lungs because the shoulder

838
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
to hit both lungs because the shoulder
 

839
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,550
to hit both lungs because the shoulder
blade and all that bone is in the way so

840
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
blade and all that bone is in the way so
 

841
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,870
blade and all that bone is in the way so
you want to so you have to make a

842
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
you want to so you have to make a
 

843
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,629
you want to so you have to make a
perfect shot to get them both and to be

844
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
perfect shot to get them both and to be
 

845
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,110
perfect shot to get them both and to be
honest when I took my shot I was a

846
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:24,120
honest when I took my shot I was a
 

847
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,030
honest when I took my shot I was a
couple inches or a few inches right and

848
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:27,040
couple inches or a few inches right and
 

849
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,189
couple inches or a few inches right and
so it went went through through the

850
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
so it went went through through the
 

851
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,389
so it went went through through the
first lung and then it sunk the arrow

852
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:31,399
first lung and then it sunk the arrow
 

853
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,710
first lung and then it sunk the arrow
all the way into the moose and but it

854
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:33,720
all the way into the moose and but it
 

855
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,470
all the way into the moose and but it
didn't it allowed that second lung to

856
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:35,480
didn't it allowed that second lung to
 

857
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,749
didn't it allowed that second lung to
stay breathing which which meant the

858
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
stay breathing which which meant the
 

859
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,269
stay breathing which which meant the
Moose stayed alive longer what's your

860
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:40,279
Moose stayed alive longer what's your
 

861
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,150
Moose stayed alive longer what's your
relationship with the animal in a

00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
relationship with the animal in a
 

863
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,110
relationship with the animal in a
situation like that you said death is a

864
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:44,120
situation like that you said death is a
 

865

part of yeah that's an interesting
 

867
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,150
part of yeah that's an interesting
thought because no matter what your

885
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,909
all it's all we're all part of this
ecosystem I think it's really easy in a

886
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:07,919
ecosystem I think it's really easy in a
 

887
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,710
ecosystem I think it's really easy in a
particularly in an urban environment but

888
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
particularly in an urban environment but
 

889
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,669
particularly in an urban environment but
anywhere to think that we're separate

890
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:12,679
anywhere to think that we're separate
 

891
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,630
anywhere to think that we're separate
from the ecosystem but we are very much

892
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
from the ecosystem but we are very much
 

893
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,549
from the ecosystem but we are very much
a part of it um whether it be you know

894
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:17,559
a part of it um whether it be you know
 

895
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,669
a part of it um whether it be you know
farming requires you know all this

soybeans and and when you get the plows

900
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
soybeans and and when you get the plows
 

901
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,429
soybeans and and when you get the plows
and the combines you know you're losing

902
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:26,439
and the combines you know you're losing
 

903
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,069
and the combines you know you're losing
all kinds of different animals and all

kind of potential
 

907
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,350
kind of potential
habitat this so it's not costree and so

908
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
habitat this so it's not costree and so
 

909

exact number and it's like and I know
 

927
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,310
exact number and it's like and I know
what the cost of that is and I'm aware

928
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,320
what the cost of that is and I'm aware
 

929

1049
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,149
we're you know people have been hunting
forever and and uh I think it speaks to

most pure form of it and that you get

1056
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:35,480
most pure form of it and that you get
 

1057
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,430
most pure form of it and that you get
those experiences more often than with a

bring it home into the freezer so so if
 

1159
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,230
bring it home into the freezer so so if
we step back uh what are the 10 items

1160
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,240
we step back uh what are the 10 items
 

1161
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,269
we step back uh what are the 10 items
you brought and what's actually the

1162
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:42,279
you brought and what's actually the
 

1163
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,029
you brought and what's actually the
challenge of figuring out which items to

1164
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,039
challenge of figuring out which items to
 

1165
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,630
challenge of figuring out which items to
bring yeah the challenge is that you

don't exactly know what your sight
opportunities are going to be so you

1170
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:49,600
opportunities are going to be so you
 

1171
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,789
opportunities are going to be so you
don't really know should I bring a

1203
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,990
watch I would have taken the the net cuz
I I just planned to make a net but I

1204
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,000
I I just planned to make a net but I
 

1205
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,990
I I just planned to make a net but I
would have rather just had two Nets

1206
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:43,000
would have rather just had two Nets
 

1207
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,549

the Northern woods in particular every

1210
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:47,279
the Northern woods in particular every
 

1211
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,190
the Northern woods in particular every
tree is you know the size of your arm or

1212
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
tree is you know the size of your arm or
 

1213
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,669
tree is you know the size of your arm or
leg you can chop it down with an ax and

1214
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:50,679
leg you can chop it down with an ax and
 

1215
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,149
leg you can chop it down with an ax and
a couple swings yeah yeah you don't

1216

a couple swings yeah yeah you don't
 

1217
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,789
a couple swings yeah yeah you don't
really need the saw um and so it was

1218
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:55,799
really need the saw um and so it was
 

1219
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,669
really need the saw um and so it was
handy at times and useful but I think it

1220
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
handy at times and useful but I think it
 

1221
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,070
handy at times and useful but I think it
was my

1222
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,080
was my
 

1223
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,870
was my
if I had to do nine items I would have

1224
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
if I had to do nine items I would have
 

1225
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,990
if I had to do nine items I would have
been just fine without the saw so two

1226
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,000
been just fine without the saw so two
 

1227
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,990
been just fine without the saw so two
nests would just expand your uh food

1228
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:07,000
nests would just expand your uh food
 

1229
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,510
nests would just expand your uh food

Gathering
 

1231
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,669
Gathering
potential and then the in terms of

1232
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
potential and then the in terms of
 

1233
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,510
potential and then the in terms of
trapping you were okay with just the

1234
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:14,520

situation your location I actually had a
 

1295
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,950
situation your location I actually had a
what I thought was a pretty good plan

1296
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
what I thought was a pretty good plan
 

1297

1299
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,389
going into Al loan and it just the you
know the location didn't allow for what

1300
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:36,399
know the location didn't allow for what
 

1301
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:38,269
know the location didn't allow for what
I thought it would what was the plan

1302
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:38,279
I thought it would what was the plan
 

1303
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:40,070
I thought it would what was the plan
well I thought I would just catch a

1304
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,080
well I thought I would just catch a
 

1305
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,630
well I thought I would just catch a
bunch of fish cuz I'm on a really good

1306
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:41,640
bunch of fish cuz I'm on a really good
 

1307
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,750
bunch of fish cuz I'm on a really good
fishing lake I catch a whole bunch of

1308
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
fishing lake I catch a whole bunch of
 

1309
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,269
fishing lake I catch a whole bunch of
fish and let them rot for a little while

1310
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:46,279
fish and let them rot for a little while
 

1311
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,830
fish and let them rot for a little while
and then just drag them all through the

1312
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:47,840
and then just drag them all through the
 

1313
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,190
and then just drag them all through the
woods into a big pile and then hunt a

1314
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:50,200
woods into a big pile and then hunt a
 

1315
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,669
woods into a big pile and then hunt a
bear on that Big Fish

1316
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
bear on that Big Fish
 

1317
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,870
bear on that Big Fish
pile that was the plan and I thought but

1318
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:56,880
pile that was the plan and I thought but
 

1319
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,029
pile that was the plan and I thought but
when I got there uh for one I had a hard

1320
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
when I got there uh for one I had a hard
 

1321
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,830
when I got there uh for one I had a hard
time catching fish off the bat you know

1322
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:00,840
time catching fish off the bat you know
 

1323

it they didn't come like I was hoping
and then for for two it had burned prior

1326
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:05,840
and then for for two it had burned prior
 

1327
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,310
and then for for two it had burned prior
so there were no berries and so there

1328
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:08,320
so there were no berries and so there
 

1329
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,669
so there were no berries and so there
were very few berries which meant there

1330
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:09,679
were very few berries which meant there
 

1331
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,630
were very few berries which meant there
weren't grous there weren't be they

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,240
grumpy at the start like this place
 

1355
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,350
grumpy at the start like this place
sex and then and then once I reassessed

1356
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,360
sex and then and then once I reassessed
 

1357
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,350

that there were moose tracks and such so
 

1361
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,269
that there were moose tracks and such so
I just started a plan for that I moved

1362
00:26:48,269 --> 00:26:48,279
I just started a plan for that I moved
 

1363
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,269
I just started a plan for that I moved
my uh camp in a into a area that was as

1364
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:52,279
my uh camp in a into a area that was as
 

1365
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,990
my uh camp in a into a area that was as
removed as I could be from where all the

1366
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
removed as I could be from where all the
 

1367
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,870
removed as I could be from where all the
action is where the tracks were so that

1368
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:55,880
action is where the tracks were so that
 

1369
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,430
action is where the tracks were so that
I wasn't disturbing animal patterns I

1370
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:58,440
I wasn't disturbing animal patterns I
 

1371

not going to live you're not going to be

1386
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:16,880
not going to live you're not going to be
 

1387
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,230
not going to live you're not going to be
sustainable by you know starving it out

1388
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,240
sustainable by you know starving it out
 

1389
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,350
sustainable by you know starving it out
youd have to Fig unlock the key that is

1390
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:22,360
youd have to Fig unlock the key that is
 

1391
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,870
youd have to Fig unlock the key that is
sustainability and I think there's a lot

1392
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:23,880
sustainability and I think there's a lot
 

1393
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,070
sustainability and I think there's a lot
of areas that still have that potential

1394
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,080
of areas that still have that potential
 

1395
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,990
of areas that still have that potential
but you have to figure out what it is

1396
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,000
but you have to figure out what it is
 

1397
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,950
but you have to figure out what it is
it's usually going to be a combination

1398
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:27,960
it's usually going to be a combination
 

1399
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,070
it's usually going to be a combination
of fishing you know trapping and then

1400
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
of fishing you know trapping and then
 

1401
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,029
of fishing you know trapping and then
hunting and then once you have some the

1402
00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:32,039
hunting and then once you have some the
 

1403
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,590
hunting and then once you have some the
fishing and trapping will get you until

1404
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:33,600
fishing and trapping will get you until
 

1405
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,630
fishing and trapping will get you until
you have some success hunting and then

1406
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:35,640
you have some success hunting and then
 

1407
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,430
you have some success hunting and then
that'll buy you three or four months of

1408
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:38,440
that'll buy you three or four months of
 

1409
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,750
that'll buy you three or four months of
time to continue another you know to

1410
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:40,760
time to continue another you know to
 

1411
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,310
time to continue another you know to
keep hunting again and you just have to

1412
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:42,320
keep hunting again and you just have to
 

1413
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,509
keep hunting again and you just have to
roll off of that but every you know

1414
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:45,519
roll off of that but every you know
 

1415
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,269
roll off of that but every you know
depends on where you are what

1416
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:47,279
depends on where you are what
 

1417
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,950
depends on where you are what
opportunities are there so okay so

1418
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:48,960
opportunities are there so okay so
 

1419
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,549
opportunities are there so okay so
that's the process fishing and trapping

1420
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:50,559
that's the process fishing and trapping
 

1421
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,990
that's the process fishing and trapping
until you're successful hunting and then

1422
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:53,000
until you're successful hunting and then
 

1423
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,630
until you're successful hunting and then
the successful hunt uh buys you some

1424
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:55,640
the successful hunt uh buys you some
 

1425
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,230
the successful hunt uh buys you some
more time mhm right right just go year

1426
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:58,240
more time mhm right right just go year
 

1427
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,990
more time mhm right right just go year
and then you just go re like that and

1428
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
and then you just go re like that and
 

1429
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,470
and then you just go re like that and
that's how people did it forever the

1430
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
that's how people did it forever the
 

1431
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,430
that's how people did it forever the
pressure I noticed it you know with that

1432
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:04,440
pressure I noticed it you know with that
 

1433
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,310
pressure I noticed it you know with that
you got that moose and then you're happy

1434
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,320
you got that moose and then you're happy
 

1435
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,029
you got that moose and then you're happy
for a week or so and then you start to

1436
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:08,039
for a week or so and then you start to
 

1437
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,669
for a week or so and then you start to
be like you know this is finite I'm GNA

1438
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:10,679
be like you know this is finite I'm GNA
 

1439
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:12,549
be like you know this is finite I'm GNA
have to do this again and you imagine if

1440
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:12,559
have to do this again and you imagine if
 

1441
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,830
have to do this again and you imagine if
you had a family that was going to

1442
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:13,840
you had a family that was going to
 

1443
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,590
you had a family that was going to
starve if you weren't successful you

1444
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:15,600
starve if you weren't successful you
 

1445
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,669
starve if you weren't successful you
know this next time and there just

1446
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
know this next time and there just
 

1447
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,190
know this next time and there just
always that pressure you know made me

1448
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,200
always that pressure you know made me
 

1449
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,909
always that pressure you know made me
really like appreciate the amount of

1450
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919
really like appreciate the amount of
 

1451
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,230
really like appreciate the amount of
what people had to deal with well in

1452
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:25,240
what people had to deal with well in
 

1453
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,230
what people had to deal with well in
terms of being active like so you have

1454
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,240
terms of being active like so you have
 

1455
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,350
terms of being active like so you have
to do stuff all all day so you get up so

1456
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
to do stuff all all day so you get up so
 

1457
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,950
to do stuff all all day so you get up so
and planning MH like what am I going to

1458
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:33,960
and planning MH like what am I going to
 

1459
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,389
and planning MH like what am I going to
in the in the midst of the frustration

1460
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:35,399
in the in the midst of the frustration
 

1461
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,549
in the in the midst of the frustration
you have to figure out like what's

1462
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:37,559
you have to figure out like what's
 

1463
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,830
you have to figure out like what's
what's the strategy like how do you put

1464
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:38,840
what's the strategy like how do you put
 

1465
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,789
what's the strategy like how do you put
up all the traps what's is that a

1466
00:28:40,789 --> 00:28:40,799
up all the traps what's is that a
 

1467
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,789
up all the traps what's is that a
decision like you know most people like

1468
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
decision like you know most people like
 

1469
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,830
decision like you know most people like
sit at their desk and have like a

1470
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:44,840
sit at their desk and have like a
 

1471
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,149
sit at their desk and have like a
calendar what are you like figuring out

1472
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:47,159
calendar what are you like figuring out
 

1473
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,029
calendar what are you like figuring out
like one thing about Wilderness life in

1474
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:50,039
like one thing about Wilderness life in
 

1475
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,470
like one thing about Wilderness life in
general is it's remarkably less

1476
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
general is it's remarkably less
 

1477
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,430
general is it's remarkably less
scheduled than anything we deal with

1478
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,440
scheduled than anything we deal with
 

1479
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,710
scheduled than anything we deal with
schedules are fairly unique to the

1480
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:57,720
schedules are fairly unique to the
 

1481
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,149
schedules are fairly unique to the
modern context you'd wake up and you

1482
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
modern context you'd wake up and you
 

1483
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,590
modern context you'd wake up and you
just sort of you have a you know

1484
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:02,600
just sort of you have a you know
 

1485
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,590
just sort of you have a you know
Confluence of things you want to do

1486
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:05,600
Confluence of things you want to do
 

1487
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,909
Confluence of things you want to do
things you need to do things you should

1488
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
things you need to do things you should
 

1489
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,909
things you need to do things you should
do and you just kind of tackle them as

1490
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
do and you just kind of tackle them as
 

1491
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,310
do and you just kind of tackle them as
you see fit as it flows in you know so

1492
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:13,320
you see fit as it flows in you know so
 

1493
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,430
you see fit as it flows in you know so
and that's actually one of the things

1494
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:14,440
and that's actually one of the things
 

1495
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,590
and that's actually one of the things
that you people really that I really

1496
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:16,600
that you people really that I really
 

1497
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,269
that you people really that I really
appreciate about that lifestyle is it

1498
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:18,279
appreciate about that lifestyle is it
 

1499
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:21,230
appreciate about that lifestyle is it
really is you're kind of in that flow

1500
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:21,240
really is you're kind of in that flow
 

1501
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,070
really is you're kind of in that flow
and so I'd wake up and be like H maybe

1502
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,080
and so I'd wake up and be like H maybe
 

1503
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,789
and so I'd wake up and be like H maybe
I'll go fishing and then I'll wander

1504
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:24,799
I'll go fishing and then I'll wander
 

1505
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,549
I'll go fishing and then I'll wander
over and fish and then I'd be like I'm

1506
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:27,559
over and fish and then I'd be like I'm
 

1507
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,430
over and fish and then I'd be like I'm
going to go check the Trap line add

1508
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:29,440
going to go check the Trap line add
 

1509
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,630
going to go check the Trap line add
every day if I add five or 10

1510
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:31,640
every day if I add five or 10
 

1511
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,909
every day if I add five or 10
snares you know you're constantly adding

1512
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:33,919
snares you know you're constantly adding
 

1513
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,230
snares you know you're constantly adding
to your productive potential and then uh

1514
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:37,240
to your productive potential and then uh
 

1515
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,029
to your productive potential and then uh
but nothing's really scheduled you're

1516
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:39,039
but nothing's really scheduled you're
 

1517
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,029
but nothing's really scheduled you're
just kind of flying by the seat of your

1518
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039
just kind of flying by the seat of your
 

1519
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,350
just kind of flying by the seat of your
pants but then there's a lot of instinct

1520
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:44,360
pants but then there's a lot of instinct
 

1521
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,310
pants but then there's a lot of instinct
that's already loaded in so much like

1522
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:46,320
that's already loaded in so much like
 

1523
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,190
that's already loaded in so much like
you already just like wisdom from all

1524
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,200
you already just like wisdom from all
 

1525
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,110
you already just like wisdom from all
the times you've had to do it before

1526
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,120
the times you've had to do it before
 

1527
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,310
the times you've had to do it before
you're just actually operating a lot on

1528
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,320
you're just actually operating a lot on
 

1529
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,350
you're just actually operating a lot on
Instinct like you said where to find to

1530
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:54,360
Instinct like you said where to find to
 

1531
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,190
Instinct like you said where to find to
place a shelter like how hard is that

1532
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:56,200
place a shelter like how hard is that
 

1533
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,190
place a shelter like how hard is that
calculation where to place the shelter

1534
00:29:58,190 --> 00:29:58,200
calculation where to place the shelter
 

1535
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,870
calculation where to place the shelter
if you're like dropped off and this is

1536
00:29:59,870 --> 00:29:59,880
if you're like dropped off and this is
 

1537
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,590
if you're like dropped off and this is
all new to you of course all those

things are going to be things you have
 

1541
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,509
things are going to be things you have
to really think through and plan when

1542
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:04,519
to really think through and plan when
 

1543
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,990
to really think through and plan when
you're thinking about a shelter you have

1544
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,000
you're thinking about a shelter you have
 

1545
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,950
you're thinking about a shelter you have
to think of oh here's a nice flat spot

1546
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:08,960
to think of oh here's a nice flat spot
 

1547
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,549
to think of oh here's a nice flat spot
you know that's a good place but also is

1548
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:10,559
you know that's a good place but also is
 

1549
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,950
you know that's a good place but also is
there firewood nearby and if I'm going

1550
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:11,960
there firewood nearby and if I'm going
 

1551
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,269
there firewood nearby and if I'm going
to be here for months is there enough

1552
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:13,279
to be here for months is there enough
 

1553
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,310
to be here for months is there enough
firewood that I'm not going to be

1554
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320
firewood that I'm not going to be
 

1555
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,110
firewood that I'm not going to be
walking a half a mile to get a dry piece

1556
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,120
walking a half a mile to get a dry piece
 

1557
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,950
walking a half a mile to get a dry piece
of wood is the water nearby is there is

1558
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:19,960
of wood is the water nearby is there is
 

1559
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,909
of wood is the water nearby is there is
it is it somewhat open but also

1560
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:22,919
it is it somewhat open but also
 

1561
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,190
it is it somewhat open but also
protected from the elements cuz

1562
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
protected from the elements cuz
 

1563
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,789
protected from the elements cuz
sometimes you get a beautiful spot it is

1564
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:26,799
sometimes you get a beautiful spot it is
 

1565
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,870
sometimes you get a beautiful spot it is
great on a calm day and then wind comes

1566
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:28,880
great on a calm day and then wind comes
 

1567
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,509
great on a calm day and then wind comes
like and so there's all these factors

1568
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:31,519
like and so there's all these factors
 

1569
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,230
like and so there's all these factors
you know even down to taking in what

1570
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
you know even down to taking in what
 

1571
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,830
you know even down to taking in what
game is doing in the area also and how

1572
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:36,840
game is doing in the area also and how
 

1573
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,630
game is doing in the area also and how
that relates to where your shelter is

1574
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
that relates to where your shelter is
 

1575
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,029
that relates to where your shelter is
you said you have to consider where the

1576
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:40,039
you said you have to consider where the
 

1577
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,230
you said you have to consider where the
action will be and you want to be away

1578
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:42,240
action will be and you want to be away
 

1579
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,149
action will be and you want to be away
from the action but close enough to it

1580
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:44,159
from the action but close enough to it
 

1581
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,190
from the action but close enough to it
to see it yeah you want to be yeah right

1582
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,200
to see it yeah you want to be yeah right
 

1583
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,669
to see it yeah you want to be yeah right
and so uh ideally you know it depends

1584
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:49,679
and so uh ideally you know it depends
 

1585
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:50,789
and so uh ideally you know it depends
you're always going to make give and

1586
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
you're always going to make give and
 

1587
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,190
you're always going to make give and
takes and one thing with shelters and

1588
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,200
takes and one thing with shelters and
 

1589
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,509
takes and one thing with shelters and
location selection of stuff it's another

1590
00:30:55,509 --> 00:30:55,519
location selection of stuff it's another
 

1591
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,070
location selection of stuff it's another
thing you just have to trust your

1592
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,080
thing you just have to trust your
 

1593
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,070
thing you just have to trust your
ability to adapt in the situation

1594
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,080
ability to adapt in the situation
 

1595
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,470
ability to adapt in the situation
because you everybody has a particular

1596
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:01,480
because you everybody has a particular
 

1597
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,830
because you everybody has a particular
you know you got an idea of a shelter

1598
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:02,840
you know you got an idea of a shelter
 

1599
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,789
you know you got an idea of a shelter
you're going to build but then you get

1600
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:03,799
you're going to build but then you get
 

1601
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,149
you're going to build but then you get
there and maybe there's a good Cliff

1602
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:05,159
there and maybe there's a good Cliff
 

1603
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,950
there and maybe there's a good Cliff
that you can incorporate you know or May

1604
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:06,960
that you can incorporate you know or May
 

1605
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,990
that you can incorporate you know or May
and then you just become creative and

1606
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:09,000
and then you just become creative and
 

1607
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,149
and then you just become creative and
that's a really fun process too to just

1608
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:11,159
that's a really fun process too to just
 

1609
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:13,830
that's a really fun process too to just
allow your creativity to try to flourish

1610
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
allow your creativity to try to flourish
 

1611
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,310
allow your creativity to try to flourish
in that what kind of shelters are there

1612
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
in that what kind of shelters are there
 

1613
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,149
in that what kind of shelters are there
there's all kinds of philosophies on

1614
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
there's all kinds of philosophies on
 

1615
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,629
there's all kinds of philosophies on
shelters which is fun uh people it's fun

1616
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:20,639
shelters which is fun uh people it's fun
 

1617
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:22,830
shelters which is fun uh people it's fun
to see people try different things mine

1618
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:22,840
to see people try different things mine
 

1619
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,789
to see people try different things mine
was fairly basic for the simple reason

1620
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:24,799
was fairly basic for the simple reason
 

1621
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,909
was fairly basic for the simple reason
that I had lived you know Winters

1622
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:27,919
that I had lived you know Winters
 

1623
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,149
that I had lived you know Winters
through Winters in Siberia in a teepee

1624
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
through Winters in Siberia in a teepee
 

1625
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,149
through Winters in Siberia in a teepee
so I knew I didn't need like anything

1626
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
so I knew I didn't need like anything
 

1627
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,750
so I knew I didn't need like anything
too robust as long as I had calories I'd

1628
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:34,760
too robust as long as I had calories I'd
 

1629
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,149
too robust as long as I had calories I'd
be warm and I wasn't particularly

1630
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:37,159
be warm and I wasn't particularly
 

1631
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,629
be warm and I wasn't particularly
worried about the cold um but you'll see

1632
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:40,639
worried about the cold um but you'll see
 

1633
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:42,990
worried about the cold um but you'll see
so I kept my shelter really pretty

1634
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,000
so I kept my shelter really pretty
 

1635
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,070
so I kept my shelter really pretty
simple with idea that I built a simple

1636
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,080
simple with idea that I built a simple
 

1637
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,190
simple with idea that I built a simple
A-frame type shelter and then most of my

1638
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:48,200
A-frame type shelter and then most of my
 

1639
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,909
A-frame type shelter and then most of my
energy is going to be focused on getting

1640
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:49,919
energy is going to be focused on getting
 

1641
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,470
energy is going to be focused on getting
calories and then of course there's

1642
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:51,480
calories and then of course there's
 

1643
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,230
calories and then of course there's
always going to be downtime and in that

1644
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:53,240
always going to be downtime and in that
 

1645
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,029
always going to be downtime and in that
downtime I can tweak modify improve my

1646
00:31:56,029 --> 00:31:56,039
downtime I can tweak modify improve my
 

1647
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,230
downtime I can tweak modify improve my
shelter and that'll just be a con

1648
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,240
shelter and that'll just be a con
 

1649
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,590
shelter and that'll just be a con
process that by the by the time you're

1650
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
process that by the by the time you're
 

1651
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,909
process that by the by the time you're
there a few months you'll have all the

1652
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:00,919
there a few months you'll have all the
 

1653
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,830
there a few months you'll have all the
Kinks worked out it'll be a really nice

1654
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:02,840
Kinks worked out it'll be a really nice
 

1655
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,430
Kinks worked out it'll be a really nice
little setup but you don't have to start

1656
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:04,440
little setup but you don't have to start
 

1657
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,750
little setup but you don't have to start
with that necessarily because you got

1658
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:05,760
with that necessarily because you got
 

1659
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,149
with that necessarily because you got
other needs you got to focus on that

1660
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:08,159
other needs you got to focus on that
 

1661
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,110
other needs you got to focus on that
said you'll see a lot of people on a

1662
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,120
said you'll see a lot of people on a
 

1663
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,669
said you'll see a lot of people on a
loan that really focus on you know

1664
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
loan that really focus on you know

building the Log Cabin because they want
 

1667
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,070
building the Log Cabin because they want
to be secure or uh incorporating you

00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,080
to be secure or uh incorporating you
 

1669
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,590
to be secure or uh incorporating you

whether it be rocks or whether it be
digg in a hole you know and we've seen

1674
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:23,799
digg in a hole you know and we've seen
 

1675
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:27,350
digg in a hole you know and we've seen
some really cool shelters and I I I'm

1676
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360
some really cool shelters and I I I'm
 

1677
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,590
some really cool shelters and I I I'm
not you knock it everybody's got there's

1678
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
not you knock it everybody's got there's
 

1679
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,269
not you knock it everybody's got there's
all Different Strokes for different

1680
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:31,279
all Different Strokes for different
 

1681
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,190
all Different Strokes for different
folks but I in my particular idea was to

1682
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:34,200
folks but I in my particular idea was to
 

1683
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,549
folks but I in my particular idea was to
keep it fairly simple improve it with

1684
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:36,559
keep it fairly simple improve it with
 

1685
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,350
keep it fairly simple improve it with
time but spend most of my energy you

1686
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
time but spend most of my energy you
 

1687
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,710
time but spend most of my energy you
know the shelter you really need to

1688
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:40,720
know the shelter you really need to
 

1689
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,549
know the shelter you really need to
think about it can't be Smoky because

1690
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:42,559
think about it can't be Smoky because
 

1691
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,710
think about it can't be Smoky because
that'll be miserable but it is nice to

1692
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:44,720
that'll be miserable but it is nice to
 

1693
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,710
that'll be miserable but it is nice to
have a fire inside so you need to have a

1694
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720
have a fire inside so you need to have a
 

1695
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,070
have a fire inside so you need to have a
fire inside that's not going to be

1696
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,080
fire inside that's not going to be
 

1697
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,190
fire inside that's not going to be
dangerous and uh smoke free and then

1698
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,200
dangerous and uh smoke free and then
 

1699
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,310
dangerous and uh smoke free and then
also airtight because you're never going

1700
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,320
also airtight because you're never going
 

1701
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,190
also airtight because you're never going
to have a warm shelter out there because

1702
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:56,200
to have a warm shelter out there because
 

1703
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,029
to have a warm shelter out there because
you don't have seals and things like

1704
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:58,039
you don't have seals and things like
 

1705
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:00,029
you don't have seals and things like
that but as long as the air is not

1706
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:00,039
that but as long as the air is not
 

1707
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,870
that but as long as the air is not
moving through it you can have a warm

1708
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:01,880
moving through it you can have a warm
 

1709
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,389
moving through it you can have a warm
enough shelter with a fire with a fire

1710
00:33:04,389 --> 00:33:04,399
enough shelter with a fire with a fire
 

1711
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,149
enough shelter with a fire with a fire
and dryer socks and stuff how do you get

1712
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:07,159
and dryer socks and stuff how do you get
 

1713
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:09,590
and dryer socks and stuff how do you get
the smoke out of the shelter if you have

1714
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,600
the smoke out of the shelter if you have
 

1715
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,950
the smoke out of the shelter if you have
good clay and mud and rock you can build

1716
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:11,960
good clay and mud and rock you can build
 

1717
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,310
good clay and mud and rock you can build
yourself a fireplace which is

1718
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:13,320
yourself a fireplace which is
 

1719
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,070
yourself a fireplace which is
surprisingly not that hard you know you

1720
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,080
surprisingly not that hard you know you
 

1721
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,190
surprisingly not that hard you know you
just oh really yeah it's fun thing to do

1722
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,200
just oh really yeah it's fun thing to do
 

1723
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,070
just oh really yeah it's fun thing to do
it works well you know take a little

1724
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:19,080
it works well you know take a little
 

1725
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,110
it works well you know take a little
hole start stacking rocks around it make

1726
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,120
hole start stacking rocks around it make
 

1727
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,029
hole start stacking rocks around it make
it make sure it's opening and it

1728
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:23,039
it make sure it's opening and it
 

1729
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,350
it make sure it's opening and it
actually works you know um so that's not

1730
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:26,360
actually works you know um so that's not
 

1731
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,269
actually works you know um so that's not
as hard as you might think

1732
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:28,279
as hard as you might think
 

1733
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,269
as hard as you might think
um for me where I was I I kind of came

1734
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:32,279
um for me where I was I I kind of came
 

1735
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,830
um for me where I was I I kind of came
up with it as I was there with my

1736
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:34,840
up with it as I was there with my
 

1737
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,070
up with it as I was there with my
A-frame you know I I hadn't built an

1738
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,080
A-frame you know I I hadn't built an
 

1739
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,549
A-frame you know I I hadn't built an
A-frame shelter like that before and so

1740
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:39,559
A-frame shelter like that before and so
 

1741
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,509
A-frame shelter like that before and so
when I built it and then I had put a

1742
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
when I built it and then I had put a
 

1743
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,230
when I built it and then I had put a
bunch of tin cans in the ground so that

1744
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,240
bunch of tin cans in the ground so that
 

1745
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,549
bunch of tin cans in the ground so that
air would get the fire so it was fed by

1746
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
air would get the fire so it was fed by
 

1747
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,750
air would get the fire so it was fed by
air which helps create a draft um but

1748
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:50,760
air which helps create a draft um but
 

1749
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,470
air which helps create a draft um but
but I realized in an A-frame it really

1750
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
but I realized in an A-frame it really
 

1751
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,350
but I realized in an A-frame it really
doesn't the smoke doesn't go out very

1752
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,360
doesn't the smoke doesn't go out very
 

1753
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,990
doesn't the smoke doesn't go out very
well even if you leave a hole at the top

1754
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,000
well even if you leave a hole at the top
 

1755
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,190
well even if you leave a hole at the top
it like collects and Billows back down

1756
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,200
it like collects and Billows back down
 

1757
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,830
it like collects and Billows back down
so then I uh cut some of my tarp and

1758
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:01,840
so then I uh cut some of my tarp and
 

1759
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,110
so then I uh cut some of my tarp and
made this and cut a hole in the in the

1760
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
made this and cut a hole in the in the
 

1761
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,549
made this and cut a hole in the in the
A-frame and then I made like a hood vent

1762
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:07,559
A-frame and then I made like a hood vent
 

1763
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,190
A-frame and then I made like a hood vent
that I could pull down and catch the

1764
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:09,200
that I could pull down and catch the
 

1765
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,790
that I could pull down and catch the
smoke with and so while the fire was

1766
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:10,800
smoke with and so while the fire was
 

1767
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,550
smoke with and so while the fire was
going it would just bow out the hood

1768
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
going it would just bow out the hood
 

1769
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,790
going it would just bow out the hood
vent and then when it was done burning

1770
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:15,800
vent and then when it was done burning
 

1771
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,069
vent and then when it was done burning
and it was just hot cold so I could

1772
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:17,079
and it was just hot cold so I could
 

1773
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,430
and it was just hot cold so I could
close it seal it up and keep the heat in

1774
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,440
close it seal it up and keep the heat in
 

1775
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,430
close it seal it up and keep the heat in
so it actually worked pretty well so

1776
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,440
so it actually worked pretty well so
 

1777
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,869
so it actually worked pretty well so
start with something that kind of works

1778
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:22,879
start with something that kind of works
 

1779
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,030
start with something that kind of works
and then keep improving yeah exactly I

1780
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,040
and then keep improving yeah exactly I
 

1781
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,190
and then keep improving yeah exactly I
was wondering I mean the the the log cap

1782
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,200
was wondering I mean the the the log cap
 

1783
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,430
was wondering I mean the the the log cap
mhm it feels like that's a thing that

1784
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:30,440
mhm it feels like that's a thing that
 

1785
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,589
mhm it feels like that's a thing that
takes a huge amount of work before work

1786
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:32,599
takes a huge amount of work before work
 

1787
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:34,510
takes a huge amount of work before work
the difference between a log cabin and a

1788
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:34,520
the difference between a log cabin and a
 

1789
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,750
the difference between a log cabin and a
warm log cabin is like an immense amount

1790
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:37,760
warm log cabin is like an immense amount
 

1791
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,909
warm log cabin is like an immense amount
of work and all the chinking and all the

1792
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:39,919
of work and all the chinking and all the
 

1793
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:42,589
of work and all the chinking and all the
door ceiling and you know the chimney

1794
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:42,599
door ceiling and you know the chimney
 

1795
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,790
door ceiling and you know the chimney
has to be anyway so otherwise it's just

1796
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:44,800
has to be anyway so otherwise it's just
 

1797
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,270
has to be anyway so otherwise it's just
going to be the same ambient temperature

1798
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:46,280
going to be the same ambient temperature
 

1799
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,270
going to be the same ambient temperature
as outside so uh I don't think alone's

1800
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,280
as outside so uh I don't think alone's
 

1801
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,510
as outside so uh I don't think alone's
the proper context for a log cabin I

1802
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:52,520
the proper context for a log cabin I
 

1803
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,629
the proper context for a log cabin I
think like a log cabin's great in as a

1804
00:34:55,629 --> 00:34:55,639
think like a log cabin's great in as a
 

1805
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,790
think like a log cabin's great in as a
hunting cabin as you know like you're

1806
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:57,800
hunting cabin as you know like you're
 

1807
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,470
hunting cabin as you know like you're
have something for years but in a 3 six

1808
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
have something for years but in a 3 six
 

1809
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,470
have something for years but in a 3 six
month scenario I don't know that it's

1810
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,480
month scenario I don't know that it's
 

1811
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,390
month scenario I don't know that it's
worth the calorie expenditure and it is

1812
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,400
worth the calorie expenditure and it is
 

1813
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,910
worth the calorie expenditure and it is
a lot of calories but that's an

1814
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:06,920
a lot of calories but that's an
 

1815
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,430
a lot of calories but that's an
interesting sort of metaphor of just

1816
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:09,440
interesting sort of metaphor of just
 

1817
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,230
interesting sort of metaphor of just
like get something that works you see a

1818
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,240
like get something that works you see a
 

1819
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,470
like get something that works you see a
lot a lot of this with companies like

1820
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:13,480
lot a lot of this with companies like
 

1821
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,550
lot a lot of this with companies like
successful companies they you know get a

1822
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:15,560
successful companies they you know get a
 

1823
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,069
successful companies they you know get a
prototype get a system that's working

1824
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:17,079
prototype get a system that's working
 

1825
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:20,589
prototype get a system that's working
and improve fast in response to the

1826
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:20,599
and improve fast in response to the
 

1827
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,030
and improve fast in response to the
conditions to the environment yeah

1828
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:22,040
conditions to the environment yeah
 

1829
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,270
conditions to the environment yeah
because it's constantly changing yeah

1830
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:24,280
because it's constantly changing yeah
 

1831
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,670
because it's constantly changing yeah
and you end up being a lot better if

1832
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
and you end up being a lot better if
 

1833
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,750
and you end up being a lot better if
you're able to learn how to respond

1834
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:28,760
you're able to learn how to respond
 

1835
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,750
you're able to learn how to respond
quickly uh versus like having a big plan

1836
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:31,760
quickly uh versus like having a big plan
 

1837
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,510
quickly uh versus like having a big plan
that takes a huge amount of time to to

1838
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:33,520
that takes a huge amount of time to to
 

1839
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,270
that takes a huge amount of time to to
accomplish that's right and forcing that

1840
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
accomplish that's right and forcing that
 

1841
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,950
accomplish that's right and forcing that
through the pipeline whether or not it

1842
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
through the pipeline whether or not it
 

1843
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,910
through the pipeline whether or not it
fits yeah can you just speak to like the

1844
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:39,920
fits yeah can you just speak to like the
 

1845
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,829
fits yeah can you just speak to like the
place you were the the Canadian Arctic

1846
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:42,839
place you were the the Canadian Arctic
 

1847
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:44,550
place you were the the Canadian Arctic
it looked cold yeah we were right near

1848
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:44,560
it looked cold yeah we were right near
 

1849
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,990
it looked cold yeah we were right near
the Arctic Circle I don't know it was

1850
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,000
the Arctic Circle I don't know it was
 

1851
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,470
the Arctic Circle I don't know it was
like 60 kilometers south of the Arctic

1852
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:48,480
like 60 kilometers south of the Arctic
 

1853
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,390
like 60 kilometers south of the Arctic
Circle so uh it was it's a really cool

1854
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:52,400
Circle so uh it was it's a really cool
 

1855
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,870
Circle so uh it was it's a really cool
area really remote thousands of little

1856
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:54,880
area really remote thousands of little
 

1857
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,349
area really remote thousands of little
Lakes you know when you fly over you're

1858
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:56,359
Lakes you know when you fly over you're
 

1859
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:57,990
Lakes you know when you fly over you're
just like man it's incredible there must

1860
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
just like man it's incredible there must
 

1861
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,510
just like man it's incredible there must
be so many of those lakes that people

1862
00:35:59,510 --> 00:35:59,520
be so many of those lakes that people
 

1863
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,990
be so many of those lakes that people
haven't been to you know it really was a

1864
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
haven't been to you know it really was a
 

1865
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,670
haven't been to you know it really was a
neat area really remote and for the

1866
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:04,680
neat area really remote and for the
 

1867
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,550
neat area really remote and for the
show's purpose I think it was perfect

1868
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:06,560
show's purpose I think it was perfect
 

1869
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,510
show's purpose I think it was perfect
because it did have enough game and

1870
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:08,520
because it did have enough game and
 

1871
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,150
because it did have enough game and
enough different Avenues forward that I

1872
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,160
enough different Avenues forward that I
 

1873
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,150
enough different Avenues forward that I
think it really did reward activity so I

1874
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,160
think it really did reward activity so I
 

1875
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,829
think it really did reward activity so I
think uh but it's a special place it was

1876
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:16,839
think uh but it's a special place it was
 

1877
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:20,109
think uh but it's a special place it was
uh Den there's the tribe that lived

1878
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:20,119
uh Den there's the tribe that lived
 

1879
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,430
uh Den there's the tribe that lived
there the den people which interestingly

1880
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:22,440
there the den people which interestingly
 

1881
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,270
there the den people which interestingly
enough here's a side note when I was in

1882
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:24,280
enough here's a side note when I was in
 

1883
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,829
enough here's a side note when I was in
Siberia I floated down this river called

1884
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:26,839
Siberia I floated down this river called
 

1885
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,030
Siberia I floated down this river called
the Pud Tusa and you get to this Village

1886
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
the Pud Tusa and you get to this Village
 

1887
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,309
the Pud Tusa and you get to this Village
called sulami and there's these KET

1888
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:33,319
called sulami and there's these KET
 

1889
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:35,309
called sulami and there's these KET
people they're called and there's only

1890
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:35,319
people they're called and there's only
 

1891
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:39,069
people they're called and there's only
600 of them left but in this is in the

1892
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:39,079
600 of them left but in this is in the
 

1893
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:41,030
600 of them left but in this is in the
middle of Siberia not in like the

1894
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
middle of Siberia not in like the
 

1895
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,309
middle of Siberia not in like the
Pacific coast but their language is

1896
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:43,319
Pacific coast but their language is
 

1897
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:47,510
Pacific coast but their language is
related to The Den people and so somehow

1898
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,520
related to The Den people and so somehow
 

1899
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,270
related to The Den people and so somehow
you know that connection was there

1900
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
you know that connection was there
 

1901
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,190
you know that connection was there
thousands of years ago super interesting

1902
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
thousands of years ago super interesting
 

1903
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,990
thousands of years ago super interesting
but yeah so language travels somehow

1904
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,000
but yeah so language travels somehow
 

1905
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,270
but yeah so language travels somehow
right and the remnant stayed back there

1906
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:56,280
right and the remnant stayed back there
 

1907
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,390
right and the remnant stayed back there
it's very interesting that Think Through

1908
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:58,400
it's very interesting that Think Through
 

1909
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,470
it's very interesting that Think Through
History yeah with within language it

1910
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
History yeah with within language it
 

1911
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,829
History yeah with within language it
contains a history of a peoples and it's

1912
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:02,839
contains a history of a peoples and it's
 

1913
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:05,109
contains a history of a peoples and it's
interesting how that evolves over time

1914
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
interesting how that evolves over time
 

1915
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,470
interesting how that evolves over time
and how Wars tell the story like

1916
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:07,480
and how Wars tell the story like
 

1917
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,630
and how Wars tell the story like
language tells the story of conflict and

1918
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:09,640
language tells the story of conflict and
 

1919
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,309
language tells the story of conflict and
conflict shaped language and we get we

1920
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:12,319
conflict shaped language and we get we
 

1921
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:14,510
conflict shaped language and we get we
get the result of that right so

1922
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:14,520
get the result of that right so
 

1923
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,349
get the result of that right so
fascinating and the barriers that

1924
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:16,359
fascinating and the barriers that
 

1925
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:19,470
fascinating and the barriers that
language creates is also the thing that

1926
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:19,480
language creates is also the thing that
 

1927
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,550
language creates is also the thing that
leads to Wars and misunderstandings and

1928
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:21,560
leads to Wars and misunderstandings and
 

1929
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,030
leads to Wars and misunderstandings and
all this kind of stuff it's a

1930
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,040
all this kind of stuff it's a
 

1931
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,910
all this kind of stuff it's a
fascinating tension uh but it got cold

1932
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:25,920
fascinating tension uh but it got cold
 

1933
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,670
fascinating tension uh but it got cold
there right it got real cold yeah I mean

1934
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:28,680
there right it got real cold yeah I mean
 

1935
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,230
there right it got real cold yeah I mean
I think I don't know what that I didn't

1936
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240
I think I don't know what that I didn't
 

1937
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,790
I think I don't know what that I didn't
have a thermometer but I imagine it

1938
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:31,800
have a thermometer but I imagine it
 

1939
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,230
have a thermometer but I imagine it
probably got

1940
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:33,240
probably got
 

1941
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,790
probably got
to30 at the most you know like it might

1942
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:35,800
to30 at the most you know like it might
 

1943
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,390
to30 at the most you know like it might
have gotten it would have definitely

1944
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:37,400
have gotten it would have definitely
 

1945
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,750
have gotten it would have definitely
gotten colder had we stayed longer but

1946
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:39,760
gotten colder had we stayed longer but
 

1947
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,030
gotten colder had we stayed longer but
uh yeah I to be honest I I was I never

1948
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:44,040
uh yeah I to be honest I I was I never
 

1949
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,790
uh yeah I to be honest I I was I never
felt cold out there I was pretty I had

1950
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:46,800
felt cold out there I was pretty I had
 

1951
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,470
felt cold out there I was pretty I had
that one pretty dialed in and once you

1952
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,480
that one pretty dialed in and once you
 

1953
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,030
that one pretty dialed in and once you
have calories you can stay warm you can

1954
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,040
have calories you can stay warm you can
 

1955
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,870
have calories you can stay warm you can
stay active you can you know you got to

1956
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:52,880
stay active you can you know you got to
 

1957
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,150
stay active you can you know you got to
dress warm you know you don't never let

1958
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:56,160
dress warm you know you don't never let
 

1959
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,630
dress warm you know you don't never let
there's a good one if you're in the cold

1960
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:57,640
there's a good one if you're in the cold
 

1961
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,829
there's a good one if you're in the cold
never let yourself get too cold because

1962
00:37:59,829 --> 00:37:59,839
never let yourself get too cold because
 

1963
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,390
never let yourself get too cold because
what happens is you'll stop feeling

1964
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:01,400
what happens is you'll stop feeling
 

1965
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,309
what happens is you'll stop feeling
what's cold and then frostbite and then

1966
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:04,319
what's cold and then frostbite and then
 

1967
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:05,990
what's cold and then frostbite and then
issues and then it's really hard to warm

1968
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
issues and then it's really hard to warm
 

1969
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,030
issues and then it's really hard to warm
back up so every I it was so annoying

1970
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:08,040
back up so every I it was so annoying
 

1971
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,069
back up so every I it was so annoying
I'd be out going to ice fish or

1972
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:10,079
I'd be out going to ice fish or
 

1973
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,910
I'd be out going to ice fish or
something and then I would just notice

1974
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:11,920
something and then I would just notice
 

1975
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,230

I wouldn't ignore that you know also you
 

1985
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,670
I wouldn't ignore that you know also you
want to be able to feel the cold yeah

1986
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:24,680
want to be able to feel the cold yeah
 

1987
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,870

2149
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,510
come out some sometimes
100% I mean you're right it does make

2150
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:30,520
100% I mean you're right it does make
 

2151
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,109
100% I mean you're right it does make
you feel alive that it like maybe that's

2152
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:33,119
you feel alive that it like maybe that's
 

2153
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,950
you feel alive that it like maybe that's
the thing that I struggle with is the

2154
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:35,960
the thing that I struggle with is the
 

2155
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,710
the thing that I struggle with is the
time passes slower cuz it does make you

2156

feel alive you get to feel time but then
 

2159
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,190
feel alive you get to feel time but then
the flip side of that is you get to feel

2160
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:44,200
the flip side of that is you get to feel

the flip side of that is you get to feel
every moment and you get to feel alive

there I remember a thought that I was

2230
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:10,559
there I remember a thought that I was
 

2231
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:11,349
there I remember a thought that I was
like I wonder if they're going to be

2232
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:11,359
like I wonder if they're going to be
 

2233

like I wonder if they're going to be
able to make this look hard you know I

2234
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:13,559
able to make this look hard you know I
 

2235

able to make this look hard you know I
did have that thought at one point and

2236
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:16,359
did have that thought at one point and
 

2237
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,390
did have that thought at one point and
CU it went pretty well and I was

2238
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
CU it went pretty well and I was
 

2239
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,150
CU it went pretty well and I was
definitely was it was hard

2240
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,160
definitely was it was hard
 

2241
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,829
definitely was it was hard
psychologically because I didn't know

2242
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:22,839
psychologically because I didn't know
 

2243
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:24,510
psychologically because I didn't know
when it was going to end like I thought

2244
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:24,520
when it was going to end like I thought
 

2245
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,430
when it was going to end like I thought
this could go you know like I said 6

2246
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:26,440
this could go you know like I said 6
 

2247
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,030
this could go you know like I said 6
months could go go eight months a year

2248
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,040
months could go go eight months a year
 

2249
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,470
months could go go eight months a year
and then you start to C you know a two

2250
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:31,480
and then you start to C you know a two
 

2251
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,790
and then you start to C you know a two
and a three-year-old and you start to

2252
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:32,800
and a three-year-old and you start to
 

2253
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,990
and a three-year-old and you start to
weigh in the is it worth it if it goes a

2254
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
weigh in the is it worth it if it goes a
 

2255
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,990
weigh in the is it worth it if it goes a
year and it's not worth it if it goes

2256
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,000
year and it's not worth it if it goes
 

2257
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,829
year and it's not worth it if it goes
eight months and I still lose so I feel

2258
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:39,839
eight months and I still lose so I feel
 

2259
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,230
eight months and I still lose so I feel
like I had this pressure and it was

2260
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,240
like I had this pressure and it was
 

2261
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,990
like I had this pressure and it was
psychologically difficult for that

2262
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,000
psychologically difficult for that
 

2263
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,630
psychologically difficult for that
reason

2264
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:45,640
reason
 

2265
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,630
reason
physically I wasn't too bad this is uh

2266
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:49,640
physically I wasn't too bad this is uh

gotten cold yet I I just thought but in
my head I thought if I get today 130 or

my head I thought if I get today 130 or

my head I thought if I get today 130 or
40

2322
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:57,720
40

even if someone else has big game I had
a pretty good idea they might quit

00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,160
a pretty good idea they might quit
 

2327
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,510
a pretty good idea they might quit
because it would be long cold dark days

2328
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
because it would be long cold dark days
 

2329

2333
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,470
boring it's freezing and and so I
thought the only time I thought I could

2334
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:13,480

2347
00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:31,910
something pound Pike on the last day I
was there maybe catch some more of those

2348
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920

know like I don't know how many calories
 

2353
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,710
know like I don't know how many calories
I had stored but I had a lot and so how

2354
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:37,720
I had stored but I had a lot and so how
 

2355
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,150
I had stored but I had a lot and so how
long would that have lasted me assuming

2356
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:39,160
long would that have lasted me assuming
 

2357
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,349
long would that have lasted me assuming
I didn't get anything else it definitely

2358
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359
I didn't get anything else it definitely
 

2359
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,670
I didn't get anything else it definitely
would have I definitely would have

2360
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:42,680
would have I definitely would have
 

2361
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,870
would have I definitely would have
reached my goal of 130 or 40 days and

2362
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:46,880
reached my goal of 130 or 40 days and
 

2363
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,150
reached my goal of 130 or 40 days and
then after that I thought we were just

2364
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,160
then after that I thought we were just
 

2365
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,150
then after that I thought we were just
going to push into the who you know then

2366
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
going to push into the who you know then
 

2367
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,030
going to push into the who you know then
it's just to see how much who has what

2368
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:52,040
it's just to see how much who has what
 

2369
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,150
it's just to see how much who has what
reserves and we'll go as far as we can

2370
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,160
reserves and we'll go as far as we can
 

2371
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,349
reserves and we'll go as far as we can
and that would get me through January

2372
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:56,359
and that would get me through January
 

2373
00:45:56,359 --> 00:45:58,069
and that would get me through January
into February and I just thought man

2374
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:58,079
into February and I just thought man
 

2375
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,349
into February and I just thought man
that's going to be miserable for people

2376
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:00,359
that's going to be miserable for people
 

2377
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:02,150
that's going to be miserable for people
and you were like I can last through and

2378
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,160
and you were like I can last through and
 

2379
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,750
and you were like I can last through and
I knew do it yeah uh what what aspect of

2380
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:05,760
I knew do it yeah uh what what aspect of
 

2381
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,710
I knew do it yeah uh what what aspect of
that is miserable the hardest thing for

2382
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:07,720
that is miserable the hardest thing for
 

2383
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,549
that is miserable the hardest thing for
me would have been the boredom um

2384
00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:10,559
me would have been the boredom um
 

2385
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,950
me would have been the boredom um
because it's hard to it's hard to stay

2386
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
because it's hard to it's hard to stay
 

2387
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,230
because it's hard to it's hard to stay
busy when it's all dark out when the ice

2388
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:15,240
busy when it's all dark out when the ice
 

2389
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,790
busy when it's all dark out when the ice

um I just think I think it would have

2394
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:22,680
um I just think I think it would have
 

2395
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,710
um I just think I think it would have
just been really boring it would had to

2396

00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
been a real zen master to push through
 

2399
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,630
been a real zen master to push through
it but because I had experienced it to

2400
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:29,640
it but because I had experienced it to
 

2401
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,510
it but because I had experienced it to
some degree I knew I could and then I

2402
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:32,520
some degree I knew I could and then I
 

2403
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,510
some degree I knew I could and then I
think things that might you know you

2404
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:34,520
think things that might you know you
 

2405
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,750
think things that might you know you
start thinking about family and this and

00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:36,760
start thinking about family and this and
 

2407
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,190
start thinking about family and this and
that and those situations and I just

2408
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
that and those situations and I just
 

2409
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,270
that and those situations and I just
knew that those because I'd gone to all

2410
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
knew that those because I'd gone to all
 

2411
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,990
knew that those because I'd gone to all
these trips to Russia for a year at a

2412
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:43,000
these trips to Russia for a year at a
 

2413
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,349
these trips to Russia for a year at a
time the time context was a little

2414
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359
time the time context was a little
 

2415
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,430
time the time context was a little
broader for me than I think for some

2416
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:47,440
broader for me than I think for some
 

2417
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,510
broader for me than I think for some
people because I I knew I could be gone

2418
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:49,520
people because I I knew I could be gone
 

2419
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,430
people because I I knew I could be gone
for a year and come back catch up with

2420
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:52,440
for a year and come back catch up with

2424
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:57,520
back whether that be psychological
 

2425
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,349
back whether that be psychological
whatever it is and we'd all enrich each

2426
00:46:59,349 --> 00:46:59,359
whatever it is and we'd all enrich each
 

2427
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:01,109
whatever it is and we'd all enrich each
other and and once it's in hindsight

2428
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
other and and once it's in hindsight
 

2429
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,390
other and and once it's in hindsight
that year would have been like that

2430
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:02,400
that year would have been like that
 

2431
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,870
that year would have been like that
talking about it so I had that

2432
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:03,880
talking about it so I had that
 

2433
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,910
talking about it so I had that
perspective and it so I knew I wasn't

2434
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
perspective and it so I knew I wasn't
 

2435
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,510
perspective and it so I knew I wasn't
going to tap for any other reason other

2436
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:07,520
going to tap for any other reason other
 

2437
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,630
going to tap for any other reason other
than running out of food someday so that

2438
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:09,640
than running out of food someday so that
 

2439
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,150
than running out of food someday so that
was my stressor and then see you're able

2440
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,160
was my stressor and then see you're able
 

2441

was my stressor and then see you're able
to given the boredom given the

00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:14,000
to given the boredom given the
 

2443
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,990
to given the boredom given the

00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,150
opportunity to share with people a part
of me that most people don't get to see

of knowing when it would end which I

2714
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:22,640
of knowing when it would end which I
 

2715
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,990
of knowing when it would end which I
think would have been a greaty

2716

think would have been a greaty
 

2717
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,990
think would have been a greaty
psychological oh yeah would have made it

2718

really easy once I got the Moose I could
have shot the moose and just not

00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:43,160
doing a 100 day cap because I for my own
 

2735
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,230
doing a 100 day cap because I for my own
experience that was the hardest part but

2736
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:45,240

2741
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,910
who don't know they put a 100 day cap on
so it's whoever can survive 100 days uh

back to sleep is it okay that I was
pretty low carb situation yeah I

2906
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
pretty low carb situation yeah I
 

2907
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,670
pretty low carb situation yeah I
actually felt really good I tried to I

2908
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:54,680
actually felt really good I tried to I
 

2909
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,470
actually felt really good I tried to I
tried to I think I would have felt

2910
00:55:56,470 --> 00:55:56,480
tried to I think I would have felt
 

2911
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,069
tried to I think I would have felt
better if I would have had a higher

2912
00:55:58,069 --> 00:55:58,079
better if I would have had a higher
 

2913
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,589
better if I would have had a higher
percentage of fat because you know it's

2914
00:56:00,589 --> 00:56:00,599
percentage of fat because you know it's
 

2915
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:02,630
percentage of fat because you know it's
still over more protein than if you're

2916
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
still over more protein than if you're
 

2917
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,589
still over more protein than if you're
on a keto diet you want a lot of fat and

2918
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:05,599
on a keto diet you want a lot of fat and
 

2919
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,309
on a keto diet you want a lot of fat and
so I did I did try to mix in like

2920
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:07,319
so I did I did try to mix in like
 

2921

times you know in a typical situation in
the woods hunting you'll raise it up in

2936
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
the woods hunting you'll raise it up in
 

2937
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,670
the woods hunting you'll raise it up in
a tree in a bag put it in like a game

2938
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:26,680
a tree in a bag put it in like a game
 

2939
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,510
a tree in a bag put it in like a game
bag so the birds can't Peck at it and

2940
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:28,520
bag so the birds can't Peck at it and
 

2941
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,349
bag so the birds can't Peck at it and
hang it in a tree so it cools you got to

2942
00:56:31,349 --> 00:56:31,359
hang it in a tree so it cools you got to
 

2943
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,270
hang it in a tree so it cools you got to
make sure first to cool it because it'll

2944
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:33,280
make sure first to cool it because it'll
 

2945
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,670
make sure first to cool it because it'll
spoil so you cool it by whatever means

2946
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:35,680
spoil so you cool it by whatever means
 

2947
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,630
spoil so you cool it by whatever means
necessary hanging it in a cool place

2948
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:37,640
necessary hanging it in a cool place
 

2949
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,549
necessary hanging it in a cool place
letting the air blow around it um and

2950
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
letting the air blow around it um and
 

2951
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,829
letting the air blow around it um and
then you'll notice that every Forest

2952
00:56:43,829 --> 00:56:43,839
then you'll notice that every Forest
 

2953
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,750
then you'll notice that every Forest
freeloader in the woods is going to come

2954
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:45,760
freeloader in the woods is going to come
 

2955
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,829
freeloader in the woods is going to come
and try to steal your food and and it

2956
00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:48,839
and try to steal your food and and it
 

2957
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:51,270
and try to steal your food and and it
was just fun I mean it was it was crazy

2958
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
was just fun I mean it was it was crazy
 

2959
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,190
was just fun I mean it was it was crazy
to watch you know like it's all the Jay

2960
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:53,200
to watch you know like it's all the Jay
 

2961
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,430
to watch you know like it's all the Jay
all the camp Jays pecking at it or

2962
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,440
all the camp Jays pecking at it or
 

2963
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,430
all the camp Jays pecking at it or
everything I did you know was was uh

2964
00:56:58,430 --> 00:56:58,440
everything I did you know was was uh
 

2965
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,270
everything I did you know was was uh
there was something that could get to it

2966
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:00,280
there was something that could get to it
 

2967
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,910
there was something that could get to it
if put on the ground the mice get on it

2968
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
if put on the ground the mice get on it
 

2969
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,589
if put on the ground the mice get on it
and they poop on it and they kind of

2970
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:03,599
and they poop on it and they kind of
 

2971
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:06,950
and they poop on it and they kind of
mess it up so I uh ultimately it kind of

2972
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:06,960
mess it up so I uh ultimately it kind of
 

2973
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,270
mess it up so I uh ultimately it kind of
just dawned on me shoot I'm going to

2974
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:08,280
just dawned on me shoot I'm going to
 

2975
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,270
just dawned on me shoot I'm going to
have to build one of those aeni like

2976
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:10,280
have to build one of those aeni like
 

2977
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,589
have to build one of those aeni like
food caches so I did and I put it up

2978
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:12,599
food caches so I did and I put it up
 

2979
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:14,750
food caches so I did and I put it up
there and I thought I kind of solved my

2980
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:14,760
there and I thought I kind of solved my
 

2981
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,150
there and I thought I kind of solved my
problem to to be honest the venki then

2982
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:18,160
problem to to be honest the venki then
 

2983
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,789
problem to to be honest the venki then
so they would have taken a page out of

2984
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:19,799
so they would have taken a page out of
 

2985
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:20,950
so they would have taken a page out of
like they would have mixed me and

2986
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:20,960
like they would have mixed me and
 

2987
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,870
like they would have mixed me and
Rolland solution they build a tall stilt

2988
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:23,880
Rolland solution they build a tall stilt
 

2989
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,230
Rolland solution they build a tall stilt
shelter and then put a box on the top

2990
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,240
shelter and then put a box on the top
 

2991
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,029
shelter and then put a box on the top
that's enclosed and then the Bears can't

2992
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:29,039
that's enclosed and then the Bears can't
 

2993
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,589
that's enclosed and then the Bears can't
get to it the mice can't poop on it the

2994
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:31,599
get to it the mice can't poop on it the
 

2995
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:33,710
get to it the mice can't poop on it the
Birds The Wolverine you know it's safe

2996
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:33,720
Birds The Wolverine you know it's safe
 

2997
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,390
Birds The Wolverine you know it's safe
and I never finished it I in in

2998
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:35,400
and I never finished it I in in
 

2999
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,750
and I never finished it I in in
hindsight I don't actually know why I

3000
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:36,760
hindsight I don't actually know why I
 

3001
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,069
hindsight I don't actually know why I
think I was just the way it timed like I

3002
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:39,079
think I was just the way it timed like I
 

3003
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:40,150
think I was just the way it timed like I
didn't think something was going to get

3004
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,160
didn't think something was going to get
 

3005
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,829
didn't think something was going to get
up there then it did and then I you know

3006
00:57:41,829 --> 00:57:41,839
up there then it did and then I you know
 

3007
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,029
up there then it did and then I you know
you're like counting calories and stuff

3008
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:44,039
you're like counting calories and stuff
 

3009
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:46,029
you're like counting calories and stuff
I should have in hindsight just boxed it

3010
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:46,039
I should have in hindsight just boxed it
 

3011
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:47,829
I should have in hindsight just boxed it
in right away but to get ready for the

3012
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:47,839
in right away but to get ready for the
 

3013
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,990
in right away but to get ready for the
long for the Long Haul yeah yeah yeah is

3014
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:51,000
long for the Long Haul yeah yeah yeah is
 

3015
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,069
long for the Long Haul yeah yeah yeah is
a rabbit starvation a real thing yeah so

3016
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:53,079
a rabbit starvation a real thing yeah so
 

3017
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:55,190
a rabbit starvation a real thing yeah so
you can't just live off protein and

3018
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:55,200
you can't just live off protein and
 

3019
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,589
you can't just live off protein and
rabbits are almost protein I'd kill a

3020
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
rabbits are almost protein I'd kill a
 

3021
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,510
rabbits are almost protein I'd kill a
rabbit eat the inerts and the brain and

3022
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:00,520
rabbit eat the inerts and the brain and
 

3023
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,430
rabbit eat the inerts and the brain and
the eyes and then everything else is

3024
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:02,440
the eyes and then everything else is
 

3025
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,710
the eyes and then everything else is
just protein and so uh it takes more

3026
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:05,720
just protein and so uh it takes more
 

3027
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,109
just protein and so uh it takes more
calories to you know process that

3028
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
calories to you know process that
 

3029
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,069
calories to you know process that
protein than you're getting from it

3030
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:11,079
protein than you're getting from it
 

3031
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:13,190
protein than you're getting from it
without the fat so you actually lose I

3032
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
without the fat so you actually lose I
 

3033
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,270
without the fat so you actually lose I
lost I had you know a lot of rabbits in

3034
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:15,280
lost I had you know a lot of rabbits in
 

3035
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,029
lost I had you know a lot of rabbits in
the first 20 days I had 28 rabbits or

3036
00:58:18,029 --> 00:58:18,039
the first 20 days I had 28 rabbits or
 

3037
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:19,589
the first 20 days I had 28 rabbits or
something but I was losing weight at

3038
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:19,599
something but I was losing weight at
 

3039
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:21,589
something but I was losing weight at
exactly the same speed as everybody else

3040
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:21,599
exactly the same speed as everybody else
 

3041
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,549
exactly the same speed as everybody else
that didn't have anything so that's

3042
00:58:23,549 --> 00:58:23,559
that didn't have anything so that's
 

3043
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:26,150
that didn't have anything so that's
interesting yeah and i' never tried that

3044
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:26,160
interesting yeah and i' never tried that
 

3045
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,910
interesting yeah and i' never tried that
before so I was wondering if I'm

3046
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:27,920

I was 13 and then 14 15 16 17 and then I
 

3213
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,670
I was 13 and then 14 15 16 17 and then I
was just in the normal run of things

3214
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:49,680
was just in the normal run of things
 

3215
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,910

3220
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:56,440
realized some of the things
 

3221
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,750
realized some of the things
while I was traveling that I wouldn't

3222
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:57,760
while I was traveling that I wouldn't
 

3223
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,430
while I was traveling that I wouldn't
experience again until I was living with

3224
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
experience again until I was living with
 

3225
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,870
experience again until I was living with
Natives and such and that was you know

3226
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:01,880
Natives and such and that was you know
 

3227
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,190
Natives and such and that was you know
you wake up you don't have a schedule

3228
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:03,200
you wake up you don't have a schedule
 

3229
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,190
you wake up you don't have a schedule
you literally just have needs and you

3230
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,200
you literally just have needs and you
 

3231
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,269
you literally just have needs and you
just somehow have to meet your needs and

3232
01:02:07,269 --> 01:02:07,279
just somehow have to meet your needs and
 

3233
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:11,269
just somehow have to meet your needs and
so uh it's it's a there's a really uh

3234
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:11,279
so uh it's it's a there's a really uh
 

3235
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:13,190
so uh it's it's a there's a really uh
sense of Freedom you get that is hard to

3236
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,200
sense of Freedom you get that is hard to
 

3237
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,670
sense of Freedom you get that is hard to
replicate elsewhere and so uh that was

3238
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:16,680
replicate elsewhere and so uh that was
 

3239
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,630
replicate elsewhere and so uh that was
eye opening to me and I think once I did

3240
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:18,640
eye opening to me and I think once I did
 

3241
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,910
eye opening to me and I think once I did
that I went back so I went back to my

3242
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:21,920
that I went back so I went back to my
 

3243
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,510
that I went back so I went back to my
old job at the salad dressing plant and

3244
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:26,520
old job at the salad dressing plant and
 

3245
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,910

there's this old crossed guy and he oh
hobo jordo is back and that's kind of

3248
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:31,559

3249
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:33,910

where I got it but but that freedom

3250
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:33,920
where I got it but but that freedom
 

3251
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,829
where I got it but but that freedom
always was very important to me I think

3252
01:02:36,829 --> 01:02:36,839

honestly the whole first year I went
through that was a very crazy time for

being misunderstood and then but then
 

3925
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:30,390
being misunderstood and then but then
trying to approach all that with a

3927
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,750
trying to approach all that with a
loving open heart and then I came back

3928
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:32,760
loving open heart and then I came back

then for the next couple months or
 

4293
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,750
then for the next couple months or
however long you'll go from one cabin

4294
01:22:58,750 --> 01:22:58,760
however long you'll go from one cabin
 

4295
01:22:58,760 --> 01:22:59,910
however long you'll go from one cabin
usually the guys are just out there

4296
01:22:59,910 --> 01:22:59,920
usually the guys are just out there
 

4297
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,310
usually the guys are just out there
doing this on their own so they'll go

4298
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:01,320
doing this on their own so they'll go
 

4299
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,189
doing this on their own so they'll go
out and they'll uh go from one cabin and

4300

out and they'll uh go from one cabin and
 

4301
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:06,270
out and they'll uh go from one cabin and
each cabin will have five or six trap

4302
01:23:06,270 --> 01:23:06,280
each cabin will have five or six trap
 

4303
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,270
each cabin will have five or six trap
lines going out of it every day it'll

4304
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:08,280
lines going out of it every day it'll
 

4305
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:10,030
lines going out of it every day it'll
take a half a day to walk to the end of

4306
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:10,040
take a half a day to walk to the end of
 

4307
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:11,709
take a half a day to walk to the end of
your trap Line open all the traps and a

4308
01:23:11,709 --> 01:23:11,719
your trap Line open all the traps and a
 

4309
01:23:11,719 --> 01:23:13,189
your trap Line open all the traps and a
half a day to get back and they'll do

4310
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:13,199
half a day to get back and they'll do
 

4311
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:14,790
half a day to get back and they'll do
that they'll spend a week at a cabin

4312
01:23:14,790 --> 01:23:14,800
that they'll spend a week at a cabin
 

4313
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,709
that they'll spend a week at a cabin
open up all the traps and then it'll

4314
01:23:16,709 --> 01:23:16,719
open up all the traps and then it'll
 

4315
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,470
open up all the traps and then it'll
take a day to hike over to the other

4316
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:18,480
take a day to hike over to the other
 

4317
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,750
take a day to hike over to the other
cabin go to that one open up all those

4318
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:20,760
cabin go to that one open up all those
 

4319
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,470
cabin go to that one open up all those
traps and then there and then like 3

4320
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:22,480
traps and then there and then like 3
 

4321
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,709
traps and then there and then like 3
weeks later or so they'll end up back at

4322
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:24,719
weeks later or so they'll end up back at
 

4323
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,270
weeks later or so they'll end up back at
the first cabin and then check all the

4324
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:26,280
the first cabin and then check all the
 

4325
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,149
the first cabin and then check all the
traps and so it's kind of that Rhythm

4326
01:23:28,149 --> 01:23:28,159
traps and so it's kind of that Rhythm
 

4327
01:23:28,159 --> 01:23:30,950
traps and so it's kind of that Rhythm
and they'll do that for uh you know a

4328
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:30,960
and they'll do that for uh you know a
 

4329
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,590
and they'll do that for uh you know a
couple few months during the winter and

4330
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
couple few months during the winter and

trying not to get lost and stuff how do
you get from one trapping location to

4366
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,120
you get from one trapping location to
 

4367
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:17,990
you get from one trapping location to
the next that's funny CU like it was

4368
01:24:17,990 --> 01:24:18,000
the next that's funny CU like it was
 

4369
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,470
the next that's funny CU like it was
both basically by landmarks and feel

4370
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:20,480
both basically by landmarks and feel
 

4371
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,510
both basically by landmarks and feel
like I didn't have compass and things

4372
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:22,520
like I didn't have compass and things
 

4373
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:24,910
like I didn't have compass and things
like that so by feel

4374
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:24,920
like that so by feel
 

4375
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:27,270
like that so by feel
okay I got myself into trouble once and

4376
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:27,280
okay I got myself into trouble once and
 

4377
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,310
okay I got myself into trouble once and
I the first time I went to one cabin I

4378
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:29,320
I the first time I went to one cabin I
 

4379
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,310
I the first time I went to one cabin I
got myself into trouble first time I

4380
01:24:31,310 --> 01:24:31,320
got myself into trouble first time I
 

4381
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,709
got myself into trouble first time I
went to the other cabin I nailed it and

4382
01:24:33,709 --> 01:24:33,719
went to the other cabin I nailed it and
 

4383
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:36,189
went to the other cabin I nailed it and
so I had two different experiences on my

4384
01:24:36,189 --> 01:24:36,199
so I had two different experiences on my
 

4385
01:24:36,199 --> 01:24:38,550
so I had two different experiences on my
first trip but the the one that I nailed

4386
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:38,560
first trip but the the one that I nailed
 

4387
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,229
first trip but the the one that I nailed
it I remember I had to go and it's like

4388
01:24:40,229 --> 01:24:40,239
it I remember I had to go and it's like
 

4389
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:42,470
it I remember I had to go and it's like
a Day hike I was like well I know the

4390
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
a Day hike I was like well I know the
 

4391
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,830
a Day hike I was like well I know the
cabin's South and so if I just walk

4392
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:44,840
cabin's South and so if I just walk
 

4393
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:46,910
cabin's South and so if I just walk
south you know the left the sun should

4394
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:46,920
south you know the left the sun should
 

4395
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,790
south you know the left the sun should
be on the left in the morning and right

4396
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:48,800
be on the left in the morning and right
 

4397
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,629
be on the left in the morning and right
in front of me in the middle of the day

4398
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:50,639
in front of me in the middle of the day
 

4399
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:52,510
in front of me in the middle of the day
and by evening it should like end up at

4400
01:24:52,510 --> 01:24:52,520
and by evening it should like end up at
 

4401
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,590
and by evening it should like end up at
my right and just kind of guess what

4402
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:54,600
my right and just kind of guess what
 

4403
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:58,590
my right and just kind of guess what
time it is and and follow along and and

4404
01:24:58,590 --> 01:24:58,600
time it is and and follow along and and

4408
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:03,080
not ended up like 100 yards from the
 

4409
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,790
not ended up like 100 yards from the
cabin I was like whoa this is the trail

4410
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:05,800
cabin I was like whoa this is the trail
 

4411
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,070
cabin I was like whoa this is the trail

Russian heads or the Soviet heads

4824
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:40,880
Russian heads or the Soviet heads
 

4825
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,030
Russian heads or the Soviet heads
whatever they had they're a little wider

4826
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:43,040
whatever they had they're a little wider
 

4827
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,189
whatever they had they're a little wider
on top here meaning you can put the

4828
01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:45,199
on top here meaning you can put the
 

4829
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,070
on top here meaning you can put the
handle through from the top like a

4830
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:47,080
handle through from the top like a
 

4831
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:49,550
handle through from the top like a
tomahawk and it uh that means you're not

4832
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:49,560
tomahawk and it uh that means you're not
 

4833
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,350
tomahawk and it uh that means you're not
dealing with a wedge and if it ever

4834
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:51,360
dealing with a wedge and if it ever
 

4835
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,149
dealing with a wedge and if it ever
loosens and you're swinging it only gets

4836
01:32:53,149 --> 01:32:53,159
loosens and you're swinging it only gets
 

4837
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:56,910
loosens and you're swinging it only gets
tighter it doesn't fly off and so that's

4838
01:32:56,910 --> 01:32:56,920
tighter it doesn't fly off and so that's
 

4839
01:32:56,920 --> 01:32:59,910
tighter it doesn't fly off and so that's
something that's kind of cool um then

4840
01:32:59,910 --> 01:32:59,920
something that's kind of cool um then
 

4841
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:03,189
something that's kind of cool um then
they have what's what they do that's

4842
01:33:03,189 --> 01:33:03,199
they have what's what they do that's
 

4843
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:06,750
they have what's what they do that's
unique is so you can see this is the

4844
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:06,760
unique is so you can see this is the
 

4845
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,310

4855
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,270
small this is a little smaller I didn't
want to make it too small because you

4856
01:33:17,270 --> 01:33:17,280
want to make it too small because you
 

4857
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,109
want to make it too small because you
need a something to actually work out

4858
01:33:19,109 --> 01:33:19,119
need a something to actually work out
 

4859
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:21,310

you're whether you're making a table or
 

4873
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:33,390
you're whether you're making a table or
a sleigh or an ax handle or whatever

4874
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:33,400
a sleigh or an ax handle or whatever
 

4875
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:34,709
a sleigh or an ax handle or whatever
you're doing that you're holding the

4876
01:33:34,709 --> 01:33:34,719
you're doing that you're holding the
 

4877
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:37,270
you're doing that you're holding the
wood and doing this work and it makes it

4878
01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:37,280
wood and doing this work and it makes it
 

4879
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,470
wood and doing this work and it makes it
really good for that planing the other

4880
01:33:39,470 --> 01:33:39,480
really good for that planing the other
 

4881
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:41,590
really good for that planing the other
thing it is especially in Northern woods

4882
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:41,600
thing it is especially in Northern woods
 

4883
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,669
thing it is especially in Northern woods
all the trees are like this big you know

4884
01:33:43,669 --> 01:33:43,679
all the trees are like this big you know
 

4885
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:45,229
all the trees are like this big you know
you're never cutting down a big giant

4886
01:33:45,229 --> 01:33:45,239
you're never cutting down a big giant
 

4887
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:48,870
you're never cutting down a big giant
tree and so when you swing with a single

4888
01:33:48,870 --> 01:33:48,880
tree and so when you swing with a single
 

4889
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,750
tree and so when you swing with a single
sided axe like this sharpen from the one

4890
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:50,760
sided axe like this sharpen from the one
 

4891
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:52,870
sided axe like this sharpen from the one
side it really with your right hand

4892
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:52,880
side it really with your right hand
 

4893
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,990
side it really with your right hand
swing like this really bites into the

4894
01:33:54,990 --> 01:33:55,000
swing like this really bites into the
 

4895
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,830
swing like this really bites into the
wood and gives you a because with that

4896
01:33:57,830 --> 01:33:57,840
wood and gives you a because with that
 

4897
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,950
wood and gives you a because with that
if you can picture it that angle is

4898
01:33:59,950 --> 01:33:59,960
if you can picture it that angle is
 

4899
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:02,629
if you can picture it that angle is
going to cause deflection MH and without

4900
01:34:02,629 --> 01:34:02,639
going to cause deflection MH and without
 

4901
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,109
going to cause deflection MH and without
that angle on your right-handed swing it

4902
01:34:04,109 --> 01:34:04,119
that angle on your right-handed swing it
 

4903
01:34:04,119 --> 01:34:06,950
that angle on your right-handed swing it
just like bites in there like crazy and

4904
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:06,960
just like bites in there like crazy and
 

4905
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,910
just like bites in there like crazy and
so uh that there's other little Divine

4906
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:10,920
so uh that there's other little Divine
 

4907
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,870
so uh that there's other little Divine
you know the handle is made by some

4908
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
you know the handle is made by some
 

4909
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,070
you know the handle is made by some
Amish guys in Canada this is all Hand

01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:15,080
Amish guys in Canada this is all Hand
 

4911
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:18,109
Amish guys in Canada this is all Hand
Forged by uh oh it's Hand Forged yeah I

4912
01:34:18,109 --> 01:34:18,119
Forged by uh oh it's Hand Forged yeah I
 

4913
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:19,990
Forged by uh oh it's Hand Forged yeah I
mean yeah it looks and so it's a pretty

4914
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:20,000
mean yeah it looks and so it's a pretty
 

4915
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,350
mean yeah it looks and so it's a pretty
sweet little yeah it's amazing there's

4916
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:22,360
sweet little yeah it's amazing there's
 

4917
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,990
sweet little yeah it's amazing there's
other things you know like i s slly

4918
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:24,000
other things you know like i s slly
 

4919
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,070
other things you know like i s slly
rounded this pole here it's just a

4920
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:26,080
rounded this pole here it's just a
 

4921
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:27,870
rounded this pole here it's just a
little Nuance cuz when you pound a steak

4922
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:27,880
little Nuance cuz when you pound a steak
 

4923
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:31,390
little Nuance cuz when you pound a steak
in if you picture it if it's if it's

4924
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:31,400
in if you picture it if it's if it's
 

4925
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,270
in if you picture it if it's if it's
convex when you're pounding it it's

4926
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:33,280
convex when you're pounding it it's
 

4927
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,229
convex when you're pounding it it's
going to blow the fibers apart if it has

4928
01:34:35,229 --> 01:34:35,239
going to blow the fibers apart if it has
 

4929
01:34:35,239 --> 01:34:37,790
going to blow the fibers apart if it has
just a slight concave it helps hold the

4930
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:37,800
just a slight concave it helps hold the
 

4931
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,270
just a slight concave it helps hold the
fibers together and so it's a little

4932
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:40,280
fibers together and so it's a little
 

4933
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,149
fibers together and so it's a little
nuanced not too flat because you want to

4934
01:34:42,149 --> 01:34:42,159
nuanced not too flat because you want to
 

4935
01:34:42,159 --> 01:34:43,830
nuanced not too flat because you want to
still be able to use the back as you

4936
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:43,840
still be able to use the back as you
 

4937
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,270
still be able to use the back as you
would what kind of stuff are you using

4938
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:45,280

01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:49,520
important to chop through ice in a
 

4943
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,189
important to chop through ice in a
winter situation which you probably

4944
01:34:51,189 --> 01:34:51,199
winter situation which you probably
 

4945
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:52,310
winter situation which you probably
hopefully won't

4946
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:52,320
hopefully won't
 

4947
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,109
hopefully won't
need but what I use an axe all the time

4948
01:34:55,109 --> 01:34:55,119
need but what I use an axe all the time
 

4949
01:34:55,119 --> 01:34:59,590
need but what I use an axe all the time
for is when I'm when it's wet and rainy

4950
01:34:59,590 --> 01:34:59,600
for is when I'm when it's wet and rainy
 

4951
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,149
for is when I'm when it's wet and rainy
and you need to start a fire like it's

4952
01:35:02,149 --> 01:35:02,159
and you need to start a fire like it's
 

4953
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:03,950
and you need to start a fire like it's
it's hard to get to the middle of

4954
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:03,960
it's hard to get to the middle of
 

4955
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:07,189
it's hard to get to the middle of
drywood if just a knife or a saw and so

4956
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:07,199
drywood if just a knife or a saw and so
 

4957
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,229
drywood if just a knife or a saw and so
you can I can go out there find a dead

4958
01:35:09,229 --> 01:35:09,239
you can I can go out there find a dead
 

4959
01:35:09,239 --> 01:35:11,950
you can I can go out there find a dead
Tall Tree you know dead standing tree

4960
01:35:11,950 --> 01:35:11,960
Tall Tree you know dead standing tree
 

4961
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,109
Tall Tree you know dead standing tree
chop it down split it apart split it

4962
01:35:14,109 --> 01:35:14,119
chop it down split it apart split it
 

4963
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:16,430
chop it down split it apart split it
open get to the drywood on the inside

4964
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:16,440

shave it some little curls and have a

4966
01:35:18,950 --> 01:35:18,960
shave it some little curls and have a
 

4967
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:21,189
shave it some little curls and have a
fire going pretty fast and so if I have

4968
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:21,199
fire going pretty fast and so if I have
 

4969
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:23,189
fire going pretty fast and so if I have
an axe I feel always confident that I

4970
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:23,199
an axe I feel always confident that I
 

4971
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,870
an axe I feel always confident that I
can get a quick fire in whatever weather

4972
01:35:25,870 --> 01:35:25,880
can get a quick fire in whatever weather
 

4973
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:28,709
can get a quick fire in whatever weather
and I wouldn't feel the same without it

4974
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:28,719
and I wouldn't feel the same without it
 

4975
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:31,990
and I wouldn't feel the same without it
in that regard so that's the main thing

4976
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,000
in that regard so that's the main thing
 

4977
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,390
in that regard so that's the main thing
um of course you can use it I use it if

4978
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:34,400
um of course you can use it I use it if
 

4979
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,350
um of course you can use it I use it if
you're taking an animal apart or if

4980
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:36,360
you're taking an animal apart or if
 

4981
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:40,709
you're taking an animal apart or if
you're uh what you know all kinds of uh

4982
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:40,719
you're uh what you know all kinds of uh

what's the use of a saw versus an X I

4988
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:47,920
what's the use of a saw versus an X I
 

4989
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,709
what's the use of a saw versus an X I
greatly prefer an axxe a saw though has

4990
01:35:51,709 --> 01:35:51,719
greatly prefer an axxe a saw though has

its value goes up quite a bit when

4992
01:35:53,709 --> 01:35:53,719
its value goes up quite a bit when
 

4993
01:35:53,719 --> 01:35:55,430
its value goes up quite a bit when
you're in Hardwoods like when you're in

4994
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
you're in Hardwoods like when you're in
 

4995
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,229
you're in Hardwoods like when you're in
a hardwood Oaks and Hickory and things

4996
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:58,239
a hardwood Oaks and Hickory and things
 

4997
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,270
a hardwood Oaks and Hickory and things
like that it's they're a lot harder to

4998
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:00,280
like that it's they're a lot harder to
 

4999
01:36:00,280 --> 01:36:03,070
like that it's they're a lot harder to
chop so a saw is pretty nice in those

5000
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:03,080
chop so a saw is pretty nice in those
 

5001
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,590
chop so a saw is pretty nice in those
situations I'd say um in those

5002
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:05,600
situations I'd say um in those
 

5003
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,870
situations I'd say um in those
situations I'd like to have both uh in

5004
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:07,880
situations I'd like to have both uh in
 

5005
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,750
situations I'd like to have both uh in
the Northwoods and in like more

5006
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:09,760
the Northwoods and in like more
 

5007
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,030
the Northwoods and in like more
coniferous forests I don't think there's

5008
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:12,040
coniferous forests I don't think there's
 

5009
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:14,149
coniferous forests I don't think there's
enough advantages that a saw incurs with

5010
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:14,159
enough advantages that a saw incurs with
 

5011
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:15,750
enough advantages that a saw incurs with
a good axe now you'll see people with

5012
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:15,760
a good axe now you'll see people with
 

5013
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,590
a good axe now you'll see people with
little like Camp axes and stuff and they

5014
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:18,600
little like Camp axes and stuff and they
 

5015
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,430
little like Camp axes and stuff and they
just don't think they like axes it's

5016
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:20,440
just don't think they like axes it's
 

5017
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:22,270
just don't think they like axes it's
like well you haven't actually tried to

5018
01:36:22,270 --> 01:36:22,280
like well you haven't actually tried to
 

5019
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,950
like well you haven't actually tried to
try a good one first and get good with

5020
01:36:23,950 --> 01:36:23,960
try a good one first and get good with
 

5021
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:25,270
try a good one first and get good with

the forest I spend a lot of time in in
 

5171
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:03,510
the forest I spend a lot of time in in
all the Northwoods the best thing you

5172
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:03,520
all the Northwoods the best thing you
 

5173
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,030
all the Northwoods the best thing you
can do is find a dead standing tree so

5174
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,040
can do is find a dead standing tree so
 

5175
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:09,830
can do is find a dead standing tree so
it can be downpouring rain and you chop

5176
01:39:09,830 --> 01:39:09,840
it can be downpouring rain and you chop
 

5177
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,470
it can be downpouring rain and you chop
that tree down and then when you when

5178
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:12,480
that tree down and then when you when
 

5179
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:13,990
that tree down and then when you when
you split it open no matter how much

5180
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:14,000
you split it open no matter how much
 

5181
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,270
you split it open no matter how much
it's been raining it'll be dry on the

5182
01:39:16,270 --> 01:39:16,280
it's been raining it'll be dry on the
 

5183
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,510
it's been raining it'll be dry on the
inside so you chop that tree down chop a

5184
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:18,520
inside so you chop that tree down chop a
 

5185
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,310
inside so you chop that tree down chop a
piece you know a foot long piece out and

5186
01:39:21,310 --> 01:39:21,320
piece you know a foot long piece out and
 

5187
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:23,669
piece you know a foot long piece out and
then split that thing open and then

5188
01:39:23,669 --> 01:39:23,679
then split that thing open and then
 

5189
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:25,709
then split that thing open and then
split it again and then you get to that

5190
01:39:25,709 --> 01:39:25,719
split it again and then you get to that
 

5191
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:28,910
split it again and then you get to that
in inner drywood and then you try to do

5192
01:39:28,910 --> 01:39:28,920
in inner drywood and then you try to do
 

5193
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,629
in inner drywood and then you try to do
this maybe under a spruce tree or under

5194
01:39:30,629 --> 01:39:30,639
this maybe under a spruce tree or under
 

5195
01:39:30,639 --> 01:39:32,070
this maybe under a spruce tree or under
your own body so that it's not getting

5196
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:32,080
your own body so that it's not getting
 

5197
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,229
your own body so that it's not getting
rained on while you're doing it make a

5198
01:39:34,229 --> 01:39:34,239
rained on while you're doing it make a
 

5199
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,790
rained on while you're doing it make a
bunch of little curls that'll light

5200
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:35,800
bunch of little curls that'll light
 

5201
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:38,470
bunch of little curls that'll light
catch a flame or light and then you make

5202
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:38,480
catch a flame or light and then you make
 

5203
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,910
catch a flame or light and then you make
a lot of a a lot more kindling and

5204
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:40,920
a lot of a a lot more kindling and
 

5205
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:42,629
a lot of a a lot more kindling and
little pieces of drywood than you think

5206
01:39:42,629 --> 01:39:42,639
little pieces of drywood than you think
 

5207
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:43,669
little pieces of drywood than you think
because what'll happen you'll light it

5208
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:43,679
because what'll happen you'll light it
 

5209
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,470
because what'll happen you'll light it
and it'll burn through and it like dang

5210
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:45,480
and it'll burn through and it like dang
 

5211
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:48,030
and it'll burn through and it like dang
it so just be patient you're going to be

5212
01:39:48,030 --> 01:39:48,040
it so just be patient you're going to be
 

5213
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:51,189
it so just be patient you're going to be
fine you know like and make a nice pile

5214
01:39:51,189 --> 01:39:51,199
fine you know like and make a nice pile
 

5215
01:39:51,199 --> 01:39:54,750
fine you know like and make a nice pile
of curls that you can light spark and

5216
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:54,760
of curls that you can light spark and
 

5217
01:39:54,760 --> 01:39:57,510
of curls that you can light spark and
then get a lot of good dry kindling and

5218
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:57,520
then get a lot of good dry kindling and
 

5219
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:59,310
then get a lot of good dry kindling and
then don't be afraid to just boom boom

5220
01:39:59,310 --> 01:39:59,320
then don't be afraid to just boom boom
 

5221
01:39:59,320 --> 01:40:00,950
then don't be afraid to just boom boom
boom pile a bunch of wood on and make a

5222
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:00,960
boom pile a bunch of wood on and make a
 

5223
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,350
boom pile a bunch of wood on and make a
big old fire get warm as fast as you can

5224
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:03,360
big old fire get warm as fast as you can
 

5225
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,470
big old fire get warm as fast as you can
it's amazing how much that of a recharge

5226
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:05,480
it's amazing how much that of a recharge
 

5227
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:07,589
it's amazing how much that of a recharge
it is when you're cold and wet you can

5228
01:40:07,589 --> 01:40:07,599
it is when you're cold and wet you can
 

5229
01:40:07,599 --> 01:40:09,669
it is when you're cold and wet you can
throw relatively wet wood on top of that

5230
01:40:09,669 --> 01:40:09,679
throw relatively wet wood on top of that
 

5231
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:11,750
throw relatively wet wood on top of that
once you get that going yeah then it'll

5232
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:11,760
once you get that going yeah then it'll
 

5233
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,830
once you get that going yeah then it'll
dry as it goes but you need to be able

5234
01:40:13,830 --> 01:40:13,840
dry as it goes but you need to be able
 

5235
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,310
dry as it goes but you need to be able
to split open and get all that nice dry

5236
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:16,320
to split open and get all that nice dry
 

5237
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,189
to split open and get all that nice dry
wood on the inside I saw that you

5238
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:19,199
wood on the inside I saw that you
 

5239
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,750
wood on the inside I saw that you
mentioned that you look for fat wood

5240
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:21,760
mentioned that you look for fat wood
 

5241
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:24,589
mentioned that you look for fat wood
what's fat wood so on lot of pine trees

5242
01:40:24,589 --> 01:40:24,599
what's fat wood so on lot of pine trees
 

5243
01:40:24,599 --> 01:40:26,189
what's fat wood so on lot of pine trees
a place where the tree was injured when

5244
01:40:26,189 --> 01:40:26,199
a place where the tree was injured when
 

5245
01:40:26,199 --> 01:40:29,350
a place where the tree was injured when
it was alive it like pumped sap to it

5246
01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:29,360
it was alive it like pumped sap to it
 

5247
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:31,550
it was alive it like pumped sap to it
and then is a good point because I use

5248
01:40:31,550 --> 01:40:31,560
and then is a good point because I use
 

5249
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:34,589
and then is a good point because I use
this a lot um it pumps that tree full of

5250
01:40:34,589 --> 01:40:34,599
this a lot um it pumps that tree full of
 

5251
01:40:34,599 --> 01:40:37,070
this a lot um it pumps that tree full of
sap and then years later the tree dies

5252
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:37,080
sap and then years later the tree dies
 

5253
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:41,430
sap and then years later the tree dies
dries out rots away but that sap infused

5254
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:41,440
dries out rots away but that sap infused
 

5255
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:45,350
dries out rots away but that sap infused
wood um it's it's like turpentine in

5256
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:45,360
wood um it's it's like turpentine in
 

5257
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,669
wood um it's it's like turpentine in
there you know it's oily and so if it

5258
01:40:47,669 --> 01:40:47,679
there you know it's oily and so if it
 

5259
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,830
there you know it's oily and so if it
gets wet it does you can still light it

5260
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:49,840
gets wet it does you can still light it
 

5261
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:52,669
gets wet it does you can still light it
it repulses water and so if you can find

5262
01:40:52,669 --> 01:40:52,679
it repulses water and so if you can find
 

5263
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:53,910
it repulses water and so if you can find
that in

5264
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:53,920
that in
 

5265
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,070
that in
a rainstorm you can just make a little

5266
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:56,080
a rainstorm you can just make a little
 

5267
01:40:56,080 --> 01:40:57,870
a rainstorm you can just make a little
pile of those shavings get the crappiest

5268
01:40:57,870 --> 01:40:57,880
pile of those shavings get the crappiest
 

5269
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,470
pile of those shavings get the crappiest
spark or quickest light and it'll just

5270
01:40:59,470 --> 01:40:59,480
spark or quickest light and it'll just
 

5271
01:40:59,480 --> 01:41:02,629
spark or quickest light and it'll just
sit there and and burn like a like a

5272
01:41:02,629 --> 01:41:02,639
sit there and and burn like a like a
 

5273
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:04,430
sit there and and burn like a like a
factory fire starter you know it's

5274
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:04,440
factory fire starter you know it's
 

5275
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,470
factory fire starter you know it's
really really nice so it's good to spot

5276
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:07,480
really really nice so it's good to spot

for yeah it's really fascinating and
then you make this thing that's just to

5282
01:41:13,229 --> 01:41:13,239
then you make this thing that's just to
 

5283

01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,360
get the sauna going
 

5285
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:18,070
get the sauna going
fast just that was what was that that

5286
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:18,080
fast just that was what was that that
 

5287
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,589
fast just that was what was that that
was oil oh it this used motor oil I had

omelet type thing and then but all of a

6300
02:00:49,350 --> 02:00:49,360
omelet type thing and then but all of a
 

6301
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:51,069
omelet type thing and then but all of a
sudden that takes you down this whole

6302

sudden that takes you down this whole
 

6303
02:00:51,079 --> 02:00:53,709
sudden that takes you down this whole
train to where pretty soon you're

6304
02:00:53,709 --> 02:00:53,719
train to where pretty soon you're
 

6305
02:00:53,719 --> 02:00:56,709
train to where pretty soon you're
justifying what's

6306
02:00:56,709 --> 02:00:56,719
justifying what's
 

6307
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:00,550
justifying what's
completely uh unjustifiable say gradual

6308

completely uh unjustifiable say gradual
 

6309
02:01:00,560 --> 02:01:02,589
completely uh unjustifiable say gradual
yeah it's a gradual process of a little

6310
02:01:02,589 --> 02:01:02,599
yeah it's a gradual process of a little
 

6311
02:01:02,599 --> 02:01:04,790
yeah it's a gradual process of a little
bit at a time I think that's why like

6312
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:04,800
bit at a time I think that's why like
 

6313

bit at a time I think that's why like
for me like having a a path of faith is

6314
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:07,960
for me like having a a path of faith is
 

6315

02:01:10,069 --> 02:01:10,079
like works as like a mooring because it
 

6317
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:11,990
like works as like a mooring because it
can help me shine that light on myself

6318
02:01:11,990 --> 02:01:12,000
can help me shine that light on myself
 

6319
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,149
can help me shine that light on myself
you know it's like something out because

6320
02:01:13,149 --> 02:01:13,159
you know it's like something out because
 

6321
02:01:13,159 --> 02:01:14,589
you know it's like something out because
if you're just looking at yourself and

6322
02:01:14,589 --> 02:01:14,599
if you're just looking at yourself and
 

6323
02:01:14,599 --> 02:01:18,310
if you're just looking at yourself and
looking within yourself for for your

6324
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:18,320
looking within yourself for for your
 

6325
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,709
looking within yourself for for your
compass in life it's really easy to get

compass in life it's really easy to get
 

6327
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:23,310
compass in life it's really easy to get
that thing out of whack but you kind of

6328
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:23,320
that thing out of whack but you kind of
 

6329
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:26,270
that thing out of whack but you kind of
need a perspective from which you can

6330
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:26,280
need a perspective from which you can
 

6331
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:27,629
need a perspective from which you can
step out of yourself and look into

6332
02:01:27,629 --> 02:01:27,639
step out of yourself and look into
 

6333
02:01:27,639 --> 02:01:29,510
step out of yourself and look into
yourself and judge yourself accordingly

02:06:13,559 --> 02:06:15,709
feel the love it's so wonderful why you
know but then I would you know at times

6552
02:06:15,709 --> 02:06:15,719
know but then I would you know at times
 

6553
02:06:15,719 --> 02:06:16,709
know but then I would you know at times
I would try to picture them and I

6554
02:06:16,709 --> 02:06:16,719
I would try to picture them and I
 

6555
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:18,109
I would try to picture them and I
couldn't quite picture the kids but I

6556
02:06:18,109 --> 02:06:18,119
couldn't quite picture the kids but I
 

6557
02:06:18,119 --> 02:06:20,830
couldn't quite picture the kids but I
could feel the love and then um and then

6558
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:20,840
could feel the love and then um and then
 

6559
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,870
could feel the love and then um and then
I started asking all the deepest in

6560
02:06:22,870 --> 02:06:22,880
I started asking all the deepest in
 

6561
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,470
I started asking all the deepest in
existential questions I could you know

6562
02:06:24,470 --> 02:06:24,480
existential questions I could you know
 

6563
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:25,790
existential questions I could you know
and it felt like I was just one answer

6564
02:06:25,790 --> 02:06:25,800
and it felt like I was just one answer
 

6565
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,589
and it felt like I was just one answer
another answer another answer everything

6566
02:06:27,589 --> 02:06:27,599
another answer another answer everything
 

6567
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:29,669
another answer another answer everything
was being answered and I felt like I was

6568
02:06:29,669 --> 02:06:29,679
was being answered and I felt like I was
 

6569
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:31,790
was being answered and I felt like I was
communing with God whatever you want to

6570
02:06:31,790 --> 02:06:31,800
communing with God whatever you want to
 

6571
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:34,669
communing with God whatever you want to
say and but I was very aware of the fact

6572
02:06:34,669 --> 02:06:34,679
say and but I was very aware of the fact
 

6573
02:06:34,679 --> 02:06:36,629
say and but I was very aware of the fact
that that communing was just peeling

6574
02:06:36,629 --> 02:06:36,639
that that communing was just peeling
 

6575
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:39,229
that that communing was just peeling
back the tiniest corner of the infinite

6576
02:06:39,229 --> 02:06:39,239
back the tiniest corner of the infinite
 

6577
02:06:39,239 --> 02:06:41,669
back the tiniest corner of the infinite
and it just dumped me with every answer

6578
02:06:41,669 --> 02:06:41,679
and it just dumped me with every answer
 

6579
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:44,709
and it just dumped me with every answer
I felt like I could have and it kind of

6580
02:06:44,709 --> 02:06:44,719
I felt like I could have and it kind of
 

6581
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:48,510
I felt like I could have and it kind of
blew me away so then I asked it well if

6582
02:06:48,510 --> 02:06:48,520
blew me away so then I asked it well if
 

6583
02:06:48,520 --> 02:06:50,189
blew me away so then I asked it well if
you're the infinite like why did you

6584
02:06:50,189 --> 02:06:50,199
you're the infinite like why did you
 

6585
02:06:50,199 --> 02:06:52,229
you're the infinite like why did you
reveal to me yourself why did use like

6586
02:06:52,229 --> 02:06:52,239
reveal to me yourself why did use like
 

6587
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:54,109
reveal to me yourself why did use like
the story of Jesus to Reve reveal

6588
02:06:54,109 --> 02:06:54,119
the story of Jesus to Reve reveal
 

6589
02:06:54,119 --> 02:06:56,229
the story of Jesus to Reve reveal
yourself and and

6590
02:06:56,229 --> 02:06:56,239
yourself and and
 

6591
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:58,189
yourself and and
then that

6592
02:06:58,189 --> 02:06:58,199
then that
 

6593
02:06:58,199 --> 02:07:01,270
then that
infinite um Amorphis thing had to

6594
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:01,280
infinite um Amorphis thing had to
 

6595
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:04,310
infinite um Amorphis thing had to
somehow take form for us to like for us

6596
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,320
somehow take form for us to like for us
 

6597
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,229
somehow take form for us to like for us
to be able to relate to it it had to

6598
02:07:06,229 --> 02:07:06,239
to be able to relate to it it had to
 

6599
02:07:06,239 --> 02:07:08,870
to be able to relate to it it had to
have some kind of a form and but

6600
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:08,880
have some kind of a form and but
 

6601
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,189
have some kind of a form and but
whenever you create a form out of

6602
02:07:11,189 --> 02:07:11,199
whenever you create a form out of
 

6603
02:07:11,199 --> 02:07:13,390
whenever you create a form out of
something you're like boxing it in and

6604
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:13,400
something you're like boxing it in and
 

6605
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:15,109
something you're like boxing it in and
subjugating it to boundaries and stuff

6606
02:07:15,109 --> 02:07:15,119
subjugating it to boundaries and stuff
 

6607
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:17,950
subjugating it to boundaries and stuff
like that and then that subject to pain

6608
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:17,960
like that and then that subject to pain
 

6609
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:19,669
like that and then that subject to pain
and subject to the Brokenness and all

6610
02:07:19,669 --> 02:07:19,679
and subject to the Brokenness and all
 

6611
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:21,229
and subject to the Brokenness and all
that and I was like oh wow and then but

6612
02:07:21,229 --> 02:07:21,239
that and I was like oh wow and then but
 

6613
02:07:21,239 --> 02:07:22,750
that and I was like oh wow and then but
when I that thought then all of a sudden

6614
02:07:22,750 --> 02:07:22,760
when I that thought then all of a sudden
 

6615
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:25,830
when I that thought then all of a sudden
I I could relate my like dark hands on

6616
02:07:25,830 --> 02:07:25,840
I I could relate my like dark hands on
 

6617
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:27,910
I I could relate my like dark hands on
the chains to the rest of the experience

6618
02:07:27,910 --> 02:07:27,920
the chains to the rest of the experience
 

6619
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:29,549
the chains to the rest of the experience
and then all of a sudden I could picture

6620
02:07:29,549 --> 02:07:29,559
and then all of a sudden I could picture
 

6621
02:07:29,559 --> 02:07:32,350
and then all of a sudden I could picture
my children as the children rather than

6622
02:07:32,350 --> 02:07:32,360
my children as the children rather than
 

6623
02:07:32,360 --> 02:07:35,310
my children as the children rather than
this amorphous feeling of love it was

6624
02:07:35,310 --> 02:07:35,320
this amorphous feeling of love it was
 

6625
02:07:35,320 --> 02:07:39,830
this amorphous feeling of love it was
like oh there's aana Al and and but but

6626
02:07:39,830 --> 02:07:39,840
like oh there's aana Al and and but but
 

6627
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,350
like oh there's aana Al and and but but
then they were bounded and then once

6628
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:41,360
then they were bounded and then once
 

6629
02:07:41,360 --> 02:07:42,830
then they were bounded and then once
they're bounded you're subject to the

6630
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:42,840
they're bounded you're subject to the
 

6631
02:07:42,840 --> 02:07:44,990
they're bounded you're subject to the
death and to the misunderstanding and to

6632
02:07:44,990 --> 02:07:45,000
death and to the misunderstanding and to
 

6633
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,069
death and to the misunderstanding and to
the all that and like you know I picture

6634
02:07:47,069 --> 02:07:47,079
the all that and like you know I picture
 

6635
02:07:47,079 --> 02:07:49,310
the all that and like you know I picture
the amoeba that or the cell and then

6636
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:49,320
the amoeba that or the cell and then
 

6637
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:51,990
the amoeba that or the cell and then
when it dies it it turns into a

6638
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,000
when it dies it it turns into a
 

6639
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,589
when it dies it it turns into a
unformed thing and uh so we need some

6640
02:07:54,589 --> 02:07:54,599
unformed thing and uh so we need some
 

6641
02:07:54,599 --> 02:07:57,750
unformed thing and uh so we need some
kind of form to relate to so instead of

6642
02:07:57,750 --> 02:07:57,760
kind of form to relate to so instead of
 

6643
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:00,310
kind of form to relate to so instead of
always just talking about God completely

6644
02:08:00,310 --> 02:08:00,320
always just talking about God completely
 

6645
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:02,629
always just talking about God completely
intangibly it kind of gave me a way to

6646
02:08:02,629 --> 02:08:02,639
intangibly it kind of gave me a way to
 

6647
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:04,189
intangibly it kind of gave me a way to
relate to it and I was like oh wow

6648
02:08:04,189 --> 02:08:04,199
relate to it and I was like oh wow
 

6649
02:08:04,199 --> 02:08:06,870
relate to it and I was like oh wow
that's that was really powerful to me in

6650
02:08:06,870 --> 02:08:06,880
that's that was really powerful to me in
 

6651
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:09,589
that's that was really powerful to me in
in putting it in a context that

6652
02:08:09,589 --> 02:08:09,599
in putting it in a context that
 

6653
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,229
in putting it in a context that
was

6654
02:08:11,229 --> 02:08:11,239
was
 

6655
02:08:11,239 --> 02:08:13,910
was
applicable But

6656
02:08:13,910 --> 02:08:13,920
applicable But
 

6657
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:17,629
applicable But
ultimately God is sort of the thing

6658
02:08:17,629 --> 02:08:17,639
ultimately God is sort of the thing
 

6659
02:08:17,639 --> 02:08:21,589
ultimately God is sort of the thing
that's formless that is unbounded right

6660
02:08:21,589 --> 02:08:21,599
that's formless that is unbounded right
 

6661
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:23,470
that's formless that is unbounded right
we humans

6662
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:23,480
we humans
 

6663
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:26,069
we humans
need I mean that's the the the purpose

6664
02:08:26,069 --> 02:08:26,079
need I mean that's the the the purpose
 

6665
02:08:26,079 --> 02:08:28,030
need I mean that's the the the purpose
of stories they resonate with something

6666
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:28,040
of stories they resonate with something
 

6667
02:08:28,040 --> 02:08:30,669
of stories they resonate with something
in us but when you need the sort of the

6668
02:08:30,669 --> 02:08:30,679
in us but when you need the sort of the
 

6669
02:08:30,679 --> 02:08:32,830
in us but when you need the sort of the
bounded nature the constraints of those

6670
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:32,840
bounded nature the constraints of those
 

6671
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:35,149
bounded nature the constraints of those
stories mhm otherwise we wouldn't be

6672
02:08:35,149 --> 02:08:35,159
stories mhm otherwise we wouldn't be
 

6673
02:08:35,159 --> 02:08:37,030
stories mhm otherwise we wouldn't be
able to like can't relate to it can't

6674
02:08:37,030 --> 02:08:37,040
able to like can't relate to it can't
 

6675
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:39,830
able to like can't relate to it can't
relate to it yeah yeah and and then when

6676
02:08:39,830 --> 02:08:39,840
relate to it yeah yeah and and then when
 

6677
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:42,510
relate to it yeah yeah and and then when
you look at the stories literally or you

6678
02:08:42,510 --> 02:08:42,520
you look at the stories literally or you
 

6679
02:08:42,520 --> 02:08:46,149
you look at the stories literally or you
just look at them just as they are it

6680
02:08:46,149 --> 02:08:46,159
just look at them just as they are it
 

6681
02:08:46,159 --> 02:08:50,910
just look at them just as they are it
seems um silly mhm just too simplistic

6682
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:50,920
seems um silly mhm just too simplistic
 

6683
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:52,750
seems um silly mhm just too simplistic
right right and then that was always you

6684
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:52,760
right right and then that was always you
 

6685
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:55,390
right right and then that was always you
know all my a lot of my family and loved

6686
02:08:55,390 --> 02:08:55,400
know all my a lot of my family and loved
 

6687
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:57,109
know all my a lot of my family and loved
ones and friends have completely left

6688
02:08:57,109 --> 02:08:57,119
ones and friends have completely left
 

6689
02:08:57,119 --> 02:08:59,589
ones and friends have completely left
the faith but and I totally in the way I

6690
02:08:59,589 --> 02:08:59,599
the faith but and I totally in the way I
 

6691
02:08:59,599 --> 02:09:02,350
the faith but and I totally in the way I
get it like I understand but I also

6692
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:02,360
get it like I understand but I also
 

6693
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:04,149
get it like I understand but I also
really see the baby that's being thrown

6694
02:09:04,149 --> 02:09:04,159
really see the baby that's being thrown
 

6695
02:09:04,159 --> 02:09:06,950
really see the baby that's being thrown
out with the bath water and I want to

6696
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:06,960
out with the bath water and I want to
 

6697
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:09,030
out with the bath water and I want to
cherish that in a way I guess and it's

6698
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:09,040
cherish that in a way I guess and it's
 

6699
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:11,950
cherish that in a way I guess and it's
interesting that you say that the way to

6700
02:09:11,950 --> 02:09:11,960
interesting that you say that the way to
 

6701
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:14,669
interesting that you say that the way to
know what's right and wrong is uh you

6702
02:09:14,669 --> 02:09:14,679
know what's right and wrong is uh you
 

6703
02:09:14,679 --> 02:09:17,109
know what's right and wrong is uh you
have to live it sometimes it's it's

really understand like a relationship
with God like what does that mean but

with God like what does that mean but
 

6761
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:27,669
with God like what does that mean but
then I realized when I struggled with

then I realized when I struggled with
 

6763
02:10:27,679 --> 02:10:29,950
then I realized when I struggled with
trying with taking I actually did try to

6764
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:29,960
trying with taking I actually did try to
 

6765
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:31,669
trying with taking I actually did try to
take it seriously and struggle with what

6766
02:10:31,669 --> 02:10:31,679
take it seriously and struggle with what
 

6767
02:10:31,679 --> 02:10:33,350
take it seriously and struggle with what
does it mean to live out a life of love

6768
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:33,360
does it mean to live out a life of love
 

6769
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:36,149
does it mean to live out a life of love
in the world but that's like a wrestling

6770
02:10:36,149 --> 02:10:36,159
in the world but that's like a wrestling
 

6771
02:10:36,159 --> 02:10:37,830
in the world but that's like a wrestling
match because it's not that simple it

6772
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:37,840
match because it's not that simple it
 

6773
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,990
match because it's not that simple it
doesn't sound it sounds good but it's

6774
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:40,000
doesn't sound it sounds good but it's
 

6775
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,790
doesn't sound it sounds good but it's
really hard to do and then you realize

6776
02:10:42,790 --> 02:10:42,800
really hard to do and then you realize
 

6777
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:45,750
really hard to do and then you realize
you can't do it perfectly but but in

6778
02:10:45,750 --> 02:10:45,760
you can't do it perfectly but but in
 

6779
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:48,109
you can't do it perfectly but but in
that struggle in that wrestling match is

6780
02:10:48,109 --> 02:10:48,119
that struggle in that wrestling match is
 

6781
02:10:48,119 --> 02:10:49,950
that struggle in that wrestling match is
where I actually sense that relationship

6782
02:10:49,950 --> 02:10:49,960
where I actually sense that relationship
 

6783
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:51,750
where I actually sense that relationship
and then it's and that's where it kind

6784
02:10:51,750 --> 02:10:51,760
and then it's and that's where it kind
 

6785
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:55,870
and then it's and that's where it kind
of gains life and how that really and

6786
02:10:55,870 --> 02:10:55,880
of gains life and how that really and
 

6787
02:10:55,880 --> 02:10:57,750
of gains life and how that really and
that I'm sure that relates to what

think it's grounded in understanding
that each human is able to be a really

02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:39,320
that each human is able to be a really
 

6869
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:43,430
that each human is able to be a really
bad person and a really good person and

6870
02:12:43,430 --> 02:12:43,440
bad person and a really good person and
 

6871
02:12:43,440 --> 02:12:45,589
bad person and a really good person and
that's like a choice it's a deliberate

6872
02:12:45,589 --> 02:12:45,599
that's like a choice it's a deliberate
 

6873
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:47,549
that's like a choice it's a deliberate
choice and it's a choice that's taken

6874
02:12:47,549 --> 02:12:47,559
choice and it's a choice that's taken
 

6875
02:12:47,559 --> 02:12:52,069
choice and it's a choice that's taken
every moment and builds up over time

6876
02:12:52,069 --> 02:12:52,079
every moment and builds up over time
 

6877
02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:54,830
every moment and builds up over time
and and and the hard part about it is

format and so I think what you lose in

7010
02:15:54,270 --> 02:15:54,280
format and so I think what you lose in
 

7011
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:56,589
format and so I think what you lose in
those extra couple hours is worth

7012
02:15:56,589 --> 02:15:56,599
those extra couple hours is worth
 

7013
02:15:56,599 --> 02:15:59,950

think I think it's valuable because it's
 

7067
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:05,629
think I think it's valuable because it's
easy to idealize in a way but yeah the

a bit lonely mhm you're just a cog in
 

7077
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:19,270
a bit lonely mhm you're just a cog in
the in the machine of

7078
02:17:19,270 --> 02:17:19,280
the in the machine of
 

7079
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:21,309
the in the machine of
nature that doesn't really care about

7080
02:17:21,309 --> 02:17:21,319
nature that doesn't really care about
 

7081
02:17:21,319 --> 02:17:23,030
nature that doesn't really care about
you totally I think that's something i'

7082

you totally I think that's something i'
 

7083

sat with a lot on on that show is

7084
02:17:25,469 --> 02:17:25,479
sat with a lot on on that show is
 

7085
02:17:25,479 --> 02:17:27,070
sat with a lot on on that show is
another part of the depths of your

7086
02:17:27,070 --> 02:17:27,080
another part of the depths of your
 

7087
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:29,629
another part of the depths of your
psychology delve into but it and that's

7088
02:17:29,629 --> 02:17:29,639
psychology delve into but it and that's
 

7089
02:17:29,639 --> 02:17:32,509
psychology delve into but it and that's
when I thought like I could I could I

7090
02:17:32,509 --> 02:17:32,519
when I thought like I could I could I
 

7091
02:17:32,519 --> 02:17:35,070
when I thought like I could I could I
understand that deeply but I could also

7092
02:17:35,070 --> 02:17:35,080
understand that deeply but I could also
 

7093
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:37,309
understand that deeply but I could also
choose to believe yeah that for some

7094
02:17:37,309 --> 02:17:37,319
choose to believe yeah that for some
 

7095
02:17:37,319 --> 02:17:39,589
choose to believe yeah that for some
reason it matters and then I could live

7096
02:17:39,589 --> 02:17:39,599
reason it matters and then I could live
 

7097
02:17:39,599 --> 02:17:41,429
reason it matters and then I could live
like it matters and then I could see the

7098
02:17:41,429 --> 02:17:41,439
like it matters and then I could see the
 

7099
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:42,950
like it matters and then I could see the
trajectories and then kind of that was

7100
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
trajectories and then kind of that was
 

7101
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:45,070
trajectories and then kind of that was
another fork in the road of my path I

7102
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:45,080
another fork in the road of my path I
 

7103
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:46,589
another fork in the road of my path I
guess what do you think about the

7104
02:17:46,589 --> 02:17:46,599
guess what do you think about the
 

7105
02:17:46,599 --> 02:17:48,709
guess what do you think about the
connection to the animals so in that in

7106
02:17:48,709 --> 02:17:48,719
connection to the animals so in that in
 

7107
02:17:48,719 --> 02:17:52,190
connection to the animals so in that in
that movie it's with the dogs mhm and uh

7108
02:17:52,190 --> 02:17:52,200
that movie it's with the dogs mhm and uh
 

7109
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:54,110
that movie it's with the dogs mhm and uh
with you it's the other domesticated the

7110
02:17:54,110 --> 02:17:54,120
with you it's the other domesticated the
 

7111
02:17:54,120 --> 02:17:54,990
with you it's the other domesticated the
the

7112
02:17:54,990 --> 02:17:55,000
the
 

7113
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,709
the
reindeer um what do you think about that

7114
02:17:57,709 --> 02:17:57,719
reindeer um what do you think about that
 

7115
02:17:57,719 --> 02:18:00,230
reindeer um what do you think about that
human animal Connection in the context

7116
02:18:00,230 --> 02:18:00,240
human animal Connection in the context
 

7117
02:18:00,240 --> 02:18:01,309
human animal Connection in the context
of that indifference isn't it

7118
02:18:01,309 --> 02:18:01,319
of that indifference isn't it
 

7119
02:18:01,319 --> 02:18:03,830
of that indifference isn't it
interesting that we assigned so much

7120
02:18:03,830 --> 02:18:03,840
interesting that we assigned so much
 

7121
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:06,110
interesting that we assigned so much
value and love and appreciation for

7122
02:18:06,110 --> 02:18:06,120
value and love and appreciation for
 

7123
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:08,270
value and love and appreciation for
these animals and in some degree we get

7124
02:18:08,270 --> 02:18:08,280
these animals and in some degree we get
 

7125
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:09,950
these animals and in some degree we get
that back you know reciproc I think

7126
02:18:09,950 --> 02:18:09,960
that back you know reciproc I think
 

7127
02:18:09,960 --> 02:18:11,790
that back you know reciproc I think
right now you just said the reindeer I

7128
02:18:11,790 --> 02:18:11,800
right now you just said the reindeer I
 

7129
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:13,830
right now you just said the reindeer I
think of uh the one they gave me because

7130
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:13,840
think of uh the one they gave me because
 

7131
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:15,509
think of uh the one they gave me because
he was long and Tall so they named him

7132
02:18:15,509 --> 02:18:15,519
he was long and Tall so they named him
 

7133
02:18:15,519 --> 02:18:19,190
he was long and Tall so they named him
delen and and I just remember delen and

7134
02:18:19,190 --> 02:18:19,200
delen and and I just remember delen and
 

7135
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:21,230
delen and and I just remember delen and
just watching him eat the leaves go with

7136
02:18:21,230 --> 02:18:21,240
just watching him eat the leaves go with
 

7137
02:18:21,240 --> 02:18:23,110
just watching him eat the leaves go with
me through the woods and trust him to

7138
02:18:23,110 --> 02:18:23,120
me through the woods and trust him to
 

7139
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:27,469
me through the woods and trust him to
take me through rivers and stuff and uh

7140
02:18:27,469 --> 02:18:27,479
take me through rivers and stuff and uh
 

7141
02:18:27,479 --> 02:18:29,270
take me through rivers and stuff and uh
and it really is special it's really

7142
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:29,280
and it really is special it's really
 

7143
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:32,309
and it really is special it's really
enriching you know uh to have that

7144
02:18:32,309 --> 02:18:32,319
enriching you know uh to have that
 

7145
02:18:32,319 --> 02:18:34,709
enriching you know uh to have that
relationship with an animal and I think

7146
02:18:34,709 --> 02:18:34,719
relationship with an animal and I think
 

7147
02:18:34,719 --> 02:18:36,629
relationship with an animal and I think
it also puts you in a proper context one

7148
02:18:36,629 --> 02:18:36,639
it also puts you in a proper context one
 

7149
02:18:36,639 --> 02:18:38,150
it also puts you in a proper context one
thing I noticed about the natives who

7150
02:18:38,150 --> 02:18:38,160
thing I noticed about the natives who
 

7151
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:39,870
thing I noticed about the natives who
live with those animals all the time is

7152
02:18:39,870 --> 02:18:39,880
live with those animals all the time is
 

7153
02:18:39,880 --> 02:18:41,950
live with those animals all the time is
they relate to life and death a little

7154
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:41,960
they relate to life and death a little
 

7155
02:18:41,960 --> 02:18:44,549
they relate to life and death a little
more naturally it feels you know we feel

7156
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:44,559
more naturally it feels you know we feel
 

7157
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:46,709
more naturally it feels you know we feel
really removed from it it's particularly

7158
02:18:46,709 --> 02:18:46,719
really removed from it it's particularly
 

7159
02:18:46,719 --> 02:18:49,870
really removed from it it's particularly
in urban settings and I think I think

7160
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:49,880
in urban settings and I think I think
 

7161
02:18:49,880 --> 02:18:51,910
in urban settings and I think I think
when you interact with animals and you

7162
02:18:51,910 --> 02:18:51,920
when you interact with animals and you
 

7163
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:53,990
when you interact with animals and you
have to confront the life and the death

7164
02:18:53,990 --> 02:18:54,000
have to confront the life and the death
 

7165
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,309
have to confront the life and the death
of them and the responsibility of a

7166
02:18:57,309 --> 02:18:57,319
of them and the responsibility of a
 

7167
02:18:57,319 --> 02:19:00,669
of them and the responsibility of a
symbiotic relationship you have um I

7168
02:19:00,669 --> 02:19:00,679
symbiotic relationship you have um I
 

7169
02:19:00,679 --> 02:19:02,790
symbiotic relationship you have um I
think it opens a little bit awareness to

7170
02:19:02,790 --> 02:19:02,800
think it opens a little bit awareness to
 

7171
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:06,830
think it opens a little bit awareness to
your place in the in the puzzle

7172
02:19:06,830 --> 02:19:06,840
your place in the in the puzzle
 

7173
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:10,509
your place in the in the puzzle
and puts you in it rather than above it

7174
02:19:10,509 --> 02:19:10,519
and puts you in it rather than above it
 

7175
02:19:10,519 --> 02:19:12,429
and puts you in it rather than above it
have you been able to accept your own

7176
02:19:12,429 --> 02:19:12,439
have you been able to accept your own
 

7177
02:19:12,439 --> 02:19:15,230
have you been able to accept your own
death I wonder you know you wonder when

7178
02:19:15,230 --> 02:19:15,240
death I wonder you know you wonder when
 

7179
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:17,110
death I wonder you know you wonder when
when it actually comes what you're going

7180
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:17,120
when it actually comes what you're going
 

7181
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:20,709
when it actually comes what you're going
to think but I I did have you know I did

7182
02:19:20,709 --> 02:19:20,719
to think but I I did have you know I did
 

7183
02:19:20,719 --> 02:19:22,830
to think but I I did have you know I did
did have my dad to

7184
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:22,840
did have my dad to
 

7185
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:26,389
did have my dad to
watch confronted in as positive a manner

7186
02:19:26,389 --> 02:19:26,399
watch confronted in as positive a manner
 

7187
02:19:26,399 --> 02:19:28,990
watch confronted in as positive a manner
as you could and I and that's a big

7188
02:19:28,990 --> 02:19:29,000
as you could and I and that's a big
 

7189
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,750
as you could and I and that's a big
advantage and so

7190
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:31,760
advantage and so
 

7191
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:34,589
advantage and so
I I I think when the time comes that I

7192
02:19:34,589 --> 02:19:34,599
I I I think when the time comes that I
 

7193
02:19:34,599 --> 02:19:36,830
I I I think when the time comes that I
will be ready but I think it but I think

7194
02:19:36,830 --> 02:19:36,840
will be ready but I think it but I think
 

7195
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:38,589
will be ready but I think it but I think
that's easy to say when the time feels

7196
02:19:38,589 --> 02:19:38,599
that's easy to say when the time feels
 

7197
02:19:38,599 --> 02:19:40,429
that's easy to say when the time feels
far off you know it'll be interesting if

7198
02:19:40,429 --> 02:19:40,439
far off you know it'll be interesting if
 

7199
02:19:40,439 --> 02:19:42,589
far off you know it'll be interesting if
you got a cancer diagnosis tomorrow and

7200
02:19:42,589 --> 02:19:42,599
you got a cancer diagnosis tomorrow and
 

7201
02:19:42,599 --> 02:19:43,990
you got a cancer diagnosis tomorrow and
stage four it's

7202
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:44,000
stage four it's
 

7203
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,589
stage four it's
like be heavy did you ever confront

7204
02:19:46,589 --> 02:19:46,599
like be heavy did you ever confront
 

7205
02:19:46,599 --> 02:19:48,670
like be heavy did you ever confront
death while in survival situations I

7206
02:19:48,670 --> 02:19:48,680
death while in survival situations I
 

7207
02:19:48,680 --> 02:19:51,230
death while in survival situations I

fronting the uh end

7376
02:22:53,110 --> 02:22:53,120
fronting the uh end
 

7377
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:55,389
fronting the uh end
there what are the harshest conditions

7378
02:22:55,389 --> 02:22:55,399
there what are the harshest conditions
 

7379
02:22:55,399 --> 02:22:57,710
there what are the harshest conditions
to surviving on Earth well there are

7380
02:22:57,710 --> 02:22:57,720
to surviving on Earth well there are
 

7381
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,670
to surviving on Earth well there are
places that are just purely

7382
02:22:59,670 --> 02:22:59,680
places that are just purely
 

7383
02:22:59,680 --> 02:23:01,630
places that are just purely
uninhabitable but I think as far as

7384
02:23:01,630 --> 02:23:01,640
uninhabitable but I think as far as
 

7385
02:23:01,640 --> 02:23:04,670
uninhabitable but I think as far as
places that you have a chance you have a

7386
02:23:04,670 --> 02:23:04,680
places that you have a chance you have a
 

7387
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:06,469
places that you have a chance you have a
chance that's a good way to put it what

7388
02:23:06,469 --> 02:23:06,479
chance that's a good way to put it what
 

7389
02:23:06,479 --> 02:23:08,190
chance that's a good way to put it what
with maybe Greenland I think of

7390
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:08,200
with maybe Greenland I think of
 

7391
02:23:08,200 --> 02:23:10,750
with maybe Greenland I think of
Greenland because I think of you know

7392
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:10,760
Greenland because I think of you know
 

7393
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:12,510
Greenland because I think of you know
those Vikings that settled there were

7394
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:12,520
those Vikings that settled there were
 

7395
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:16,070
those Vikings that settled there were
rugged capable dudes and they didn't

7396
02:23:16,070 --> 02:23:16,080
rugged capable dudes and they didn't
 

7397
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:18,670
rugged capable dudes and they didn't
make it but there are Inuit that that

7398
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:18,680
make it but there are Inuit that that
 

7399
02:23:18,680 --> 02:23:21,710
make it but there are Inuit that that
you know natives that live up there but

7400
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:21,720
you know natives that live up there but
 

7401
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,550
you know natives that live up there but
it's a hard life you know and the

7402
02:23:23,550 --> 02:23:23,560
it's a hard life you know and the
 

7403
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:25,110
it's a hard life you know and the
population's never grown very big

7404
02:23:25,110 --> 02:23:25,120
population's never grown very big
 

7405
02:23:25,120 --> 02:23:26,630
population's never grown very big
because they're you're scraping by up

7406
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:26,640
because they're you're scraping by up
 

7407
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:29,389
because they're you're scraping by up
there and you picture and the and the

7408
02:23:29,389 --> 02:23:29,399
there and you picture and the and the
 

7409
02:23:29,399 --> 02:23:31,269
there and you picture and the and the
Vikings that did land there you know

7410
02:23:31,269 --> 02:23:31,279
Vikings that did land there you know
 

7411
02:23:31,279 --> 02:23:34,389
Vikings that did land there you know
they just weren't able to quite adapt

7412
02:23:34,389 --> 02:23:34,399
they just weren't able to quite adapt
 

7413
02:23:34,399 --> 02:23:36,110
they just weren't able to quite adapt
and the fact that they all died out is

7414
02:23:36,110 --> 02:23:36,120
and the fact that they all died out is
 

7415
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:38,830
and the fact that they all died out is
just a symbol to that must be a pretty

7416
02:23:38,830 --> 02:23:38,840
just a symbol to that must be a pretty
 

7417
02:23:38,840 --> 02:23:40,910
just a symbol to that must be a pretty
difficult place to live what would you

7418
02:23:40,910 --> 02:23:40,920
difficult place to live what would you
 

7419
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:42,790
difficult place to live what would you
say that's that's primarily because just

7420
02:23:42,790 --> 02:23:42,800
say that's that's primarily because just
 

7421
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:44,790
say that's that's primarily because just
the food sources are limited the food

7422
02:23:44,790 --> 02:23:44,800
the food sources are limited the food
 

7423
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:46,670
the food sources are limited the food
sources are limited but the fact that

7424
02:23:46,670 --> 02:23:46,680
sources are limited but the fact that
 

7425
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:48,510
sources are limited but the fact that
some people can live there means it is

7426
02:23:48,510 --> 02:23:48,520
some people can live there means it is
 

7427
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:49,910
some people can live there means it is
possible you know they they've figured

7428
02:23:49,910 --> 02:23:49,920
possible you know they they've figured
 

7429
02:23:49,920 --> 02:23:52,510
possible you know they they've figured
out ways to to catch seals and do things

7430
02:23:52,510 --> 02:23:52,520
out ways to to catch seals and do things
 

7431
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:56,790
out ways to to catch seals and do things
to survive but it's by no means easier

7432
02:23:56,790 --> 02:23:56,800
to survive but it's by no means easier
 

7433
02:23:56,800 --> 02:23:58,910
to survive but it's by no means easier
to be taken for granted or obvious I

7434
02:23:58,910 --> 02:23:58,920
to be taken for granted or obvious I
 

7435
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:00,790
to be taken for granted or obvious I
think it's a harsh probably a harsh

7436
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:00,800
think it's a harsh probably a harsh
 

7437
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:03,030
think it's a harsh probably a harsh
place to try to live yeah it's it's

7438
02:24:03,030 --> 02:24:03,040
place to try to live yeah it's it's
 

7439
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:05,269
place to try to live yeah it's it's
fascinating not just humans but to to

7440
02:24:05,269 --> 02:24:05,279
fascinating not just humans but to to
 

7441
02:24:05,279 --> 02:24:06,910
fascinating not just humans but to to
watch how animals have figured out how

7442
02:24:06,910 --> 02:24:06,920
watch how animals have figured out how
 

7443
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:09,070
watch how animals have figured out how
to survive of watching like a

7444
02:24:09,070 --> 02:24:09,080
to survive of watching like a
 

7445
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:12,030
to survive of watching like a
documentary on polar bears like they

7446
02:24:12,030 --> 02:24:12,040
documentary on polar bears like they
 

7447
02:24:12,040 --> 02:24:14,349
documentary on polar bears like they
just figure out a way and they get then

7448
02:24:14,349 --> 02:24:14,359
just figure out a way and they get then
 

7449
02:24:14,359 --> 02:24:15,349
just figure out a way and they get then
and they've been doing it for

7450
02:24:15,349 --> 02:24:15,359
and they've been doing it for
 

7451
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:17,030
and they've been doing it for
generations and they they figure out a

7452
02:24:17,030 --> 02:24:17,040
generations and they they figure out a
 

7453
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:19,870
generations and they they figure out a
way they travel like hundreds of miles

7454
02:24:19,870 --> 02:24:19,880
way they travel like hundreds of miles
 

7455
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:21,670
way they travel like hundreds of miles
to like

7456
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:21,680
to like
 

7457
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:24,750
to like
to to the to the water to get fat and

to to the to the water to get fat and
 

7459
02:24:24,760 --> 02:24:28,070
to to the to the water to get fat and
then they travel 100 miles like for

7460
02:24:28,070 --> 02:24:28,080
then they travel 100 miles like for
 

7461
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:29,950
then they travel 100 miles like for
whatever other purpose because it

7462
02:24:29,950 --> 02:24:29,960
whatever other purpose because it
 

7463
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:31,750
whatever other purpose because it
because they want to stay on the ice I

7464

to death or things like that we uh so we
have so much now which should lead us to

8122

have so much now which should lead us to
 

8123
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:40,510
have so much now which should lead us to
be hopeful um while we try to improve

be hopeful um while we try to improve
 

8125
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:41,910

it's there's a lot of room for
improvement and I do feel like we're

that's the way it is um as the as the
 

8139
02:37:55,439 --> 02:37:58,830
that's the way it is um as the as the
tools we build become more powerful yeah

8140
02:37:58,830 --> 02:37:58,840
tools we build become more powerful yeah
 

8141
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:01,670

with my brother about that sometimes he

8146
02:38:08,550 --> 02:38:08,560
with my brother about that sometimes he
 

8147
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:10,190
with my brother about that sometimes he
takes the more positive View and I'm

8148
02:38:10,190 --> 02:38:10,200
takes the more positive View and I'm
 

8149
02:38:10,200 --> 02:38:12,750
takes the more positive View and I'm
like I mean it's great we've done great

8150
02:38:12,750 --> 02:38:12,760
like I mean it's great we've done great
 

8151
02:38:12,760 --> 02:38:15,230
like I mean it's great we've done great
but man more and more people with

8152
02:38:15,230 --> 02:38:15,240
but man more and more people with
 

8153
02:38:15,240 --> 02:38:18,190
but man more and more people with
nuclear weapons and more it's just going

8154
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:18,200
nuclear weapons and more it's just going
 

8155
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:21,510
nuclear weapons and more it's just going
to take one mistake with the more power

8156
02:38:21,510 --> 02:38:21,520
to take one mistake with the more power
 

8157
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:22,670
to take one mistake with the more power
I think there's something about the

8158
02:38:22,670 --> 02:38:22,680
I think there's something about the
 

8159
02:38:22,680 --> 02:38:25,070
I think there's something about the
sharpness of the knife's edge mhm that

8160
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:25,080
sharpness of the knife's edge mhm that
 

8161
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:28,510
sharpness of the knife's edge mhm that
gets Humanity to really like focus and

8162
02:38:28,510 --> 02:38:28,520
gets Humanity to really like focus and
 

8163
02:38:28,520 --> 02:38:31,910
gets Humanity to really like focus and
like step up and not not screw it up
