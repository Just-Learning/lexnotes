And I followed him back to his lab and

122
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:46,159
And I followed him back to his lab and
 

123
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,589

pieces and uh when I saw that you know

128
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:55,080
pieces and uh when I saw that you know
 

129
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,430

133
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,830
do you remember the year 1974 1974 so
there's just this arm in pieces yeah and

there's just this arm in pieces yeah and
 

135
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,630
there's just this arm in pieces yeah and
you you saw the pieces and you saw in

136
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
you you saw the pieces and you saw in
 

137
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,710
you you saw the pieces and you saw in
your in Your Vision the the the arm when

138
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:09,720
your in Your Vision the the the arm when
 

139
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,430
your in Your Vision the the the arm when
it's back put back together and the

140

it's back put back together and the
 

141

really how by looking at single neurons
you were going to get to a place where

162
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:36,680
you were going to get to a place where
 

163
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,229
you were going to get to a place where
you could understand you know control

164
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:39,239
you could understand you know control
 

165
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,030
you could understand you know control
systems or thought or anything like that

166
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,040
systems or thought or anything like that
 

167
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,630
systems or thought or anything like that
and uh you know the AI lab was always an

168
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
and uh you know the AI lab was always an
 

169
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,589
and uh you know the AI lab was always an
appealing this was before seale right

170
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:46,599
appealing this was before seale right
 

171
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,390
appealing this was before seale right
this was in the 70s so the AI lab was

172
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:49,400
this was in the 70s so the AI lab was
 

173
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,470
this was in the 70s so the AI lab was
always an appealing idea and so when I

174
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
always an appealing idea and so when I
 

175
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,390
always an appealing idea and so when I
went back to the AI lab with uh you know

176
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
went back to the AI lab with uh you know
 

177
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,190
went back to the AI lab with uh you know
following him uh and I saw the arm I

178
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
following him uh and I saw the arm I
 

179
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,270
following him uh and I saw the arm I
just thought you know this is it that's

180
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
just thought you know this is it that's
 

181
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,949
just thought you know this is it that's
so interesting interesting the tension

182
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
so interesting interesting the tension
 

183
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,270
so interesting interesting the tension
between the the the BCS brain and

184
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
between the the the BCS brain and
 

185
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,110
between the the the BCS brain and
cognitive science approach to

186
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
cognitive science approach to
 

187
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,229
cognitive science approach to
understanding

188
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
understanding
 

189
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,509
understanding
intelligence and the robotics approach

190
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:08,519
intelligence and the robotics approach
 

191
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,390
intelligence and the robotics approach
to understanding intelligence well BCS

192
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
to understanding intelligence well BCS
 

193
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,710
to understanding intelligence well BCS
is now morphed a bit right they they

194
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
is now morphed a bit right they they
 

195
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,550
is now morphed a bit right they they
have the center for brains minds and

196
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
have the center for brains minds and
 

197
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,189
have the center for brains minds and
machines which is uh trying to bridge

198
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
machines which is uh trying to bridge
 

199
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,789
machines which is uh trying to bridge
that Gap and even when I was there you

200
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
that Gap and even when I was there you
 

201
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,270
that Gap and even when I was there you
know David Maher was in the AI lab David

202
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
know David Maher was in the AI lab David
 

203
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,830
know David Maher was in the AI lab David
Maher had models of the brain that were

204
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:24,840
Maher had models of the brain that were
 

205
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,629
Maher had models of the brain that were
appealing both to biologists but also to

206
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:27,639
appealing both to biologists but also to
 

207
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,870
appealing both to biologists but also to
uh computer people so he was a visitor

208
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:29,880
uh computer people so he was a visitor
 

209
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,070
uh computer people so he was a visitor
in the AI Lab at the time and I guess he

210
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
in the AI Lab at the time and I guess he
 

211
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,710
in the AI Lab at the time and I guess he
became full-time there so that was the

212
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
became full-time there so that was the
 

213
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,749
became full-time there so that was the
first time a bridge was made between

214
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:36,759
first time a bridge was made between
 

215
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,270
first time a bridge was made between
those two groups then the bridge kind of

216
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
those two groups then the bridge kind of
 

217
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,510
those two groups then the bridge kind of
went away and then there was another

218
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:40,520
went away and then there was another
 

219
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,670
went away and then there was another
time in the 80s and then recently uh you

220
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
time in the 80s and then recently uh you
 

221
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,710
time in the 80s and then recently uh you
know the last five or so years there's

222
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:45,720
know the last five or so years there's
 

223
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,350
know the last five or so years there's
been a stronger connection you said you

224
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:48,360
been a stronger connection you said you
 

225
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,790
been a stronger connection you said you
were always kind of a builder what

226
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
were always kind of a builder what
 

227
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,350
were always kind of a builder what
stands out to you in memory of a thing

228
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,360
stands out to you in memory of a thing
 

229
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,830
stands out to you in memory of a thing
you've built maybe a trivial thing that

230
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:54,840
you've built maybe a trivial thing that
 

231
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,909
you've built maybe a trivial thing that
just kind of like inspired um inspired

232
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
just kind of like inspired um inspired
 

233
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,310
just kind of like inspired um inspired
you and the possibilities that this

234
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
you and the possibilities that this
 

235
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,870
you and the possibilities that this
direction of work might hold I mean we

236
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
direction of work might hold I mean we
 

237
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,430
direction of work might hold I mean we
were just doing gadgets when we were

238
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:04,440
were just doing gadgets when we were
 

239
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,029
were just doing gadgets when we were
kids you know I have a friend we were

240
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
kids you know I have a friend we were
 

241
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,150
kids you know I have a friend we were
taking you know the I don't know if

242
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,160
taking you know the I don't know if
 

243
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,029
taking you know the I don't know if
everybody remembers but fluorescent

244
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
everybody remembers but fluorescent
 

245
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,270
everybody remembers but fluorescent
lights had this uh

246
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
lights had this uh
 

247
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,710
lights had this uh
little aluminum cylinder uh I can't even

248
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
little aluminum cylinder uh I can't even
 

249
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,430
little aluminum cylinder uh I can't even
remember what it's called now that you

250
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:18,440
remember what it's called now that you
 

251
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,309
remember what it's called now that you
needed a starter I think it was uh and

252
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:21,319
needed a starter I think it was uh and
 

253
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,070
needed a starter I think it was uh and
we would take those apart fill them with

254
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,080
we would take those apart fill them with
 

255
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,230
we would take those apart fill them with
match heads put a tail on it and make it

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,240
match heads put a tail on it and make it
 

257
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,909

into little Rockets so it wasn't always

258
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
into little Rockets so it wasn't always
 

259
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,790
into little Rockets so it wasn't always
about function it was well well rocket

260
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
about function it was well well rocket
 

261
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,550
about function it was well well rocket
was pretty pretty much I guess that is

262
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
was pretty pretty much I guess that is
 

263
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,110
was pretty pretty much I guess that is
pretty functional but I guess that is a

264
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
pretty functional but I guess that is a
 

265
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,230
pretty functional but I guess that is a
question how much was it about function

266
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,240
question how much was it about function
 

267
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,990
question how much was it about function
versus just creating something cool I

268
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
versus just creating something cool I
 

269
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,990
versus just creating something cool I
think it's it's still a balance between

270
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
think it's it's still a balance between
 

271
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,390
think it's it's still a balance between
those two there was a time though when I

272
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
those two there was a time though when I
 

273
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,350
those two there was a time though when I
was a I guess I was probably already a

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:46,360
was a I guess I was probably already a

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,870
was a I guess I was probably already a

professor or maybe late in graduate
 

277
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,029
professor or maybe late in graduate
school when I thought that function was

school when I thought that function was
 

279
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:53,670
school when I thought that function was
everything and that uh you know Mobility

280
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
everything and that uh you know Mobility

dexterity perception and intelligence

282

dexterity perception and intelligence
 

283
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,309
dexterity perception and intelligence
those are sort of the function the key

284
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:57,319
those are sort of the function the key
 

285
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:01,189
those are sort of the function the key
functionalities for robotics that um

286
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
functionalities for robotics that um
 

287
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,950
functionalities for robotics that um
that's What mattered and nothing else

288
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
that's What mattered and nothing else
 

289
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,629
that's What mattered and nothing else
mattered and I even had the kind of this

290
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:05,639
mattered and I even had the kind of this
 

291
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,830
mattered and I even had the kind of this
platonic

292
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:06,840
platonic
 

293
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,670
platonic
ideal uh that a robot if you just looked

294
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
ideal uh that a robot if you just looked
 

295
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,430
ideal uh that a robot if you just looked
at a robot and it wasn't doing anything

296
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
at a robot and it wasn't doing anything
 

297
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,230
at a robot and it wasn't doing anything
it would look like a pile of junk which

298
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,240
it would look like a pile of junk which
 

299
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,189
it would look like a pile of junk which
a lot of my robots looked like in those

300
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
a lot of my robots looked like in those
 

301
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,230
a lot of my robots looked like in those
in those days but then when it started

302
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,240
in those days but then when it started
 

303
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,749
in those days but then when it started
moving you'd get the idea that it you

304
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
moving you'd get the idea that it you
 

305
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,710
moving you'd get the idea that it you
know it had some kind of life or some

306
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:21,720
know it had some kind of life or some
 

307
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,990
know it had some kind of life or some
kind of interest in its movement and I

308
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:25,000
kind of interest in its movement and I
 

309
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,670
kind of interest in its movement and I
think we purposely even designed the

00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:26,680
think we purposely even designed the

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,309
think we purposely even designed the

Aesthetics of the of the structure

314
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:30,599
Aesthetics of the of the structure
 

315
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,230
Aesthetics of the of the structure
itself uh but then uh but then you know

316
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
itself uh but then uh but then you know
 

317
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,870
itself uh but then uh but then you know
it turns out that the Aesthetics of the

318
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:35,880
it turns out that the Aesthetics of the
 

319
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,189
it turns out that the Aesthetics of the
thing itself add and combine with uh the

320
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:40,199
thing itself add and combine with uh the
 

321
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,350
thing itself add and combine with uh the
lifelike things that the robots can do

322
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:42,360
lifelike things that the robots can do
 

323
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,430
lifelike things that the robots can do
but the heart of it is you know making

324
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:44,440
but the heart of it is you know making
 

325
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,469
but the heart of it is you know making
them do things that are that are

326
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
them do things that are that are
 

327
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,629
them do things that are that are
interesting so one of the things that

328
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:49,639
interesting so one of the things that
 

329
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,909
interesting so one of the things that
underlies a lot of your work is that the

330
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:52,919
underlies a lot of your work is that the
 

331
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:54,430
underlies a lot of your work is that the
robots who create the systems you have

332
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:54,440
robots who create the systems you have
 

333
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,869
robots who create the systems you have
created for for over 40 years now have a

334
00:06:57,869 --> 00:06:57,879
created for for over 40 years now have a
 

335
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,430
created for for over 40 years now have a
kind of they're not cauti I so a lot of

336
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:01,440
kind of they're not cauti I so a lot of
 

337
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,469
kind of they're not cauti I so a lot of
robots that people know about move about

338
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:03,479
robots that people know about move about
 

339
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,830
robots that people know about move about
this world very cautiously carefully

340
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:05,840
this world very cautiously carefully
 

341
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,550
this world very cautiously carefully
very afraid of the world uh a lot of the

342
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
very afraid of the world uh a lot of the
 

343
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,350
very afraid of the world uh a lot of the
robots you built especially in the early

344
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:10,360
robots you built especially in the early
 

345
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,430
robots you built especially in the early
days were very aggressive uh undere exu

346
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
days were very aggressive uh undere exu
 

347
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,990
days were very aggressive uh undere exu
they're hopping they're they're wild

348
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,000
they're hopping they're they're wild
 

349
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,950
they're hopping they're they're wild
moving quickly so what is there a

350
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
moving quickly so what is there a
 

351
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,110
moving quickly so what is there a
philosophy underlying that well let me

352
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
philosophy underlying that well let me
 

353
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,469
philosophy underlying that well let me
tell you about how I got started on legs

354
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:23,479
tell you about how I got started on legs
 

355
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,070
tell you about how I got started on legs
at all I when I was still a graduate

356
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
at all I when I was still a graduate
 

357
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,550
at all I when I was still a graduate
student I went to a conference and was a

358
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,560
student I went to a conference and was a
 

359
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,589
student I went to a conference and was a
biological legged Locomotion conference

360
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:31,599
biological legged Locomotion conference
 

361
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,670
biological legged Locomotion conference
and I think it was in Philadelphia so it

362
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
and I think it was in Philadelphia so it
 

363
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,469
and I think it was in Philadelphia so it
was all biomechanics people you know

364
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:35,479
was all biomechanics people you know
 

365
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,110
was all biomechanics people you know
researchers who would look at muscle and

366
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:38,120
researchers who would look at muscle and
 

367
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,189
researchers who would look at muscle and
maybe neurons and things like that they

368
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:40,199
maybe neurons and things like that they
 

369
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,510
maybe neurons and things like that they
weren't so much computational people but

370
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,520
weren't so much computational people but
 

371
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,430
weren't so much computational people but
they were more biomechanics and maybe

372
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,440
they were more biomechanics and maybe
 

373
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,909
they were more biomechanics and maybe
there were a thousand people there and I

374
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
there were a thousand people there and I
 

375
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,029
there were a thousand people there and I
went to a talk uh one of the talks all

376
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
went to a talk uh one of the talks all
 

377
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,990
went to a talk uh one of the talks all
the talks were about the body of either

378
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
the talks were about the body of either
 

379
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,869
the talks were about the body of either
animals or people and respiration things

380
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:53,879
animals or people and respiration things
 

381
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,189
animals or people and respiration things
like that but one talk was by a robotics

382
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:56,199
like that but one talk was by a robotics
 

383
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:00,869
like that but one talk was by a robotics
guy and he showed a six-legged uh robot

384
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:00,879
guy and he showed a six-legged uh robot
 

385
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,270
guy and he showed a six-legged uh robot
that walked very

386
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280
that walked very
 

387
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,029
that walked very
slowly um it always had at least three

388
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:06,039
slowly um it always had at least three
 

389
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:07,710
slowly um it always had at least three
feet on the ground so it worked like a

390
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:07,720
feet on the ground so it worked like a
 

391
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,070
feet on the ground so it worked like a
table or a chair with tripod stability

392
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
table or a chair with tripod stability
 

393
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,270
table or a chair with tripod stability
and it moved really slowly and I just

394
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:12,280
and it moved really slowly and I just
 

395
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,790
and it moved really slowly and I just
looked at that and said wow that's wrong

396
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:15,800
looked at that and said wow that's wrong
 

397
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,950
looked at that and said wow that's wrong
you know that's not that's not anything

398
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:17,960
you know that's not that's not anything
 

399
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,149
you know that's not that's not anything
like how people and animals work because

400
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:20,159
like how people and animals work because
 

401
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,830
like how people and animals work because
we bounce and fly you know we have to

402
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:22,840
we bounce and fly you know we have to
 

403
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,589
we bounce and fly you know we have to
predict what's going to happen in order

404
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:24,599
predict what's going to happen in order
 

405
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,629
predict what's going to happen in order
to keep our balance when we're taking a

406
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
to keep our balance when we're taking a
 

407
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,830
to keep our balance when we're taking a
running step or something like that we

408
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:28,840
running step or something like that we
 

409
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,670
running step or something like that we
use springiness in our in our legs you

410
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:31,680
use springiness in our in our legs you
 

411
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,110
use springiness in our in our legs you
know our muscles and our tendons and

412
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
know our muscles and our tendons and
 

413
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,509
know our muscles and our tendons and
things like that as part of the story

414
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
things like that as part of the story
 

415
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,310
things like that as part of the story
you know the energy circulates we don't

416
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:37,320
you know the energy circulates we don't
 

417
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,269
you know the energy circulates we don't
just throw it away every time so and I'm

418
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:40,279
just throw it away every time so and I'm
 

419
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,909
just throw it away every time so and I'm
not sure I understood all that when I

420
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
not sure I understood all that when I
 

421
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,990
not sure I understood all that when I
first thought but I I definitely got

422
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
first thought but I I definitely got
 

423
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,190
first thought but I I definitely got
inspired to say you know let's try the

424
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
inspired to say you know let's try the
 

425
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,670
inspired to say you know let's try the
opposite and I didn't have a clue as to

426
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
opposite and I didn't have a clue as to
 

427
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,030
opposite and I didn't have a clue as to
how to make a Hopping robot work not

428
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,040
how to make a Hopping robot work not
 

429
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,750
how to make a Hopping robot work not
really you know not balance in 3D uh in

430
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
really you know not balance in 3D uh in
 

431
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,389
really you know not balance in 3D uh in
fact when I started it was all just

432
00:08:57,389 --> 00:08:57,399
fact when I started it was all just
 

433
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,190
fact when I started it was all just
about the energy of bouncing and I was

434
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
about the energy of bouncing and I was
 

435
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,670
about the energy of bouncing and I was
going to have a springy thing in the leg

436
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
going to have a springy thing in the leg
 

437
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,990
going to have a springy thing in the leg
and some actuator so that you could get

438
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
and some actuator so that you could get
 

439
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,870
and some actuator so that you could get
an energy uh regime going of bouncing

440
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:07,880
an energy uh regime going of bouncing
 

441
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,269
an energy uh regime going of bouncing
and the idea that balance was an

442
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
and the idea that balance was an
 

443
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,990
and the idea that balance was an
important part of it didn't come until a

444
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,000
important part of it didn't come until a
 

445
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,350
important part of it didn't come until a
little later uh and then you know might

446
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
little later uh and then you know might
 

447
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,150
little later uh and then you know might
made the the one-legged the pogo stick

448
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
made the the one-legged the pogo stick
 

449
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,590
made the the one-legged the pogo stick
robots now I think that we need to do

450
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:18,600
robots now I think that we need to do
 

451
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,269
robots now I think that we need to do
that in manipulation if you look at

452
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
that in manipulation if you look at
 

453
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,790
that in manipulation if you look at
robot manipulation we've been working we

454
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:23,800
robot manipulation we've been working we
 

455
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,230
robot manipulation we've been working we
a community has been working on it for

456
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:25,240
a community has been working on it for
 

457
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,590
a community has been working on it for
50 years we're nowhere near human levels

458
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:28,600
50 years we're nowhere near human levels
 

459
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,110
50 years we're nowhere near human levels
of manipulation I mean we can you know

460
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
of manipulation I mean we can you know
 

461
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,190
of manipulation I mean we can you know
it's come along but I think it's all too

462
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:34,200
it's come along but I think it's all too
 

463
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,190
it's come along but I think it's all too
safe and I think trying to break out of

464
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
safe and I think trying to break out of
 

465
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,710
safe and I think trying to break out of
that safety thing of static grasping you

466
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
that safety thing of static grasping you
 

467
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,750
that safety thing of static grasping you
know if you look at the a lot of work

468
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:42,760
know if you look at the a lot of work
 

469
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,670
know if you look at the a lot of work
that goes on it's about the geometry of

470
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:44,680
that goes on it's about the geometry of
 

471
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,470
that goes on it's about the geometry of
the part and then and then you figure

472
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
the part and then and then you figure
 

473
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,509
the part and then and then you figure
out how to move your hand so that you

474
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:48,519
out how to move your hand so that you
 

475
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,389
out how to move your hand so that you
can position it with respect to that and

476
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
can position it with respect to that and
 

477
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,069
can position it with respect to that and
then you grasp it carefully and then you

478
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:52,079
then you grasp it carefully and then you
 

479
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:54,470
then you grasp it carefully and then you
move it well that's not anything like

480
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
move it well that's not anything like
 

481
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,470
move it well that's not anything like
how people and animals work you know we

482
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
how people and animals work you know we
 

483
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,829
how people and animals work you know we
juggle in our hands we had multiple

484
00:09:58,829 --> 00:09:58,839
juggle in our hands we had multiple
 

485
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,430
juggle in our hands we had multiple
object objects and can sort them um so

486
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
object objects and can sort them um so
 

487
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,829
object objects and can sort them um so
now to be

488
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:04,839
now to be
 

489
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:07,110
now to be
fair uh being more aggressive is going

490
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
fair uh being more aggressive is going
 

491
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,509
fair uh being more aggressive is going
to mean things aren't going to work very

492
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:08,519
to mean things aren't going to work very
 

493
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,750
to mean things aren't going to work very
well for a while so it's a long it's a

494
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:10,760
well for a while so it's a long it's a
 

495
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,230
well for a while so it's a long it's a
longer term approach to the problem um

496
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
longer term approach to the problem um
 

497
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,829
longer term approach to the problem um
but that and that's just Theory now you

498
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
but that and that's just Theory now you
 

499
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,509
but that and that's just Theory now you
know maybe that won't pay off but that's

500
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
know maybe that won't pay off but that's
 

501
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,069
know maybe that won't pay off but that's
sort of how I'm trying to think about it

502
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:19,079
sort of how I'm trying to think about it
 

503
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,550
sort of how I'm trying to think about it
trying to uh encourage our group to to

504
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:21,560
trying to uh encourage our group to to
 

505
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,990
trying to uh encourage our group to to
go at it well yeah I mean we'll talk

506
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
go at it well yeah I mean we'll talk
 

507
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,590
go at it well yeah I mean we'll talk
about what it means to what is the

508
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:26,600
about what it means to what is the
 

509
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,430
about what it means to what is the
actual thing we're trying to optimize

510
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:28,440
actual thing we're trying to optimize
 

511
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,069
actual thing we're trying to optimize
and uh for a robot you know sometimes

512
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:31,079
and uh for a robot you know sometimes
 

513
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,190
and uh for a robot you know sometimes
especially with human robot interaction

514
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
especially with human robot interaction
 

515
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,670
especially with human robot interaction
maybe flaws is a good thing Perfection

516
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:36,680
maybe flaws is a good thing Perfection
 

517
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,110
maybe flaws is a good thing Perfection
is not necessarily the right thing to be

518
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,120
is not necessarily the right thing to be
 

519
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,350
is not necessarily the right thing to be
chasing just like you said maybe maybe

520
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:40,360
chasing just like you said maybe maybe
 

521
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,150
chasing just like you said maybe maybe
being good at fumbling an object uh

522
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,160
being good at fumbling an object uh
 

523
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,990
being good at fumbling an object uh
being good at fumbling might be the

524
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,000
being good at fumbling might be the
 

525
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,310
being good at fumbling might be the
right thing to optimize versus per

526
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:47,320
right thing to optimize versus per
 

527
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,310
right thing to optimize versus per
perfect modeling of the object and

528
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
perfect modeling of the object and
 

529
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,110
perfect modeling of the object and
perfect movement of the arm to gr grasp

530
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
perfect movement of the arm to gr grasp
 

531
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,470
perfect movement of the arm to gr grasp
that object cuz uh maybe Perfection is

532
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:55,480
that object cuz uh maybe Perfection is
 

533
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,030
that object cuz uh maybe Perfection is
not supposed to exist in the real world

534
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
not supposed to exist in the real world
 

535
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,590
not supposed to exist in the real world
I don't know if you know my friend Matt

536
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:58,600
I don't know if you know my friend Matt
 

537

Mason who's uh who was the director of

538
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
Mason who's uh who was the director of
 

539
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,550
Mason who's uh who was the director of
the robotics Institute at Carnegie melon

540
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:03,560
the robotics Institute at Carnegie melon
 

541
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,230
the robotics Institute at Carnegie melon
and we go back to graduate school

542
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:05,240
and we go back to graduate school
 

543
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,910
and we go back to graduate school
together but he analyzed um a movie of

544
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:08,920
together but he analyzed um a movie of
 

545
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,310
together but he analyzed um a movie of
Julia Child's doing a cooking thing and

546
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
Julia Child's doing a cooking thing and
 

547
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,509
Julia Child's doing a cooking thing and
she did I think he said something like

548
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:14,519
she did I think he said something like
 

549
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,910
she did I think he said something like
there were 40 different ways that she

550
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:16,920
there were 40 different ways that she
 

551
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,190
there were 40 different ways that she
handled a thing and none of them was

552
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
handled a thing and none of them was
 

553
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,550
handled a thing and none of them was
grasping he would she would nudge roll

554
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560
grasping he would she would nudge roll
 

555
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,790
grasping he would she would nudge roll
flatten with her you know knife things

556
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
flatten with her you know knife things
 

557
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,190
flatten with her you know knife things
like that and none of them was grasping

558
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:28,200
like that and none of them was grasping
 

559
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,269
like that and none of them was grasping
so okay let's go back to the early days

560
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:30,279
so okay let's go back to the early days
 

561
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,430
so okay let's go back to the early days
first of all you've uh created and led

562
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:32,440
first of all you've uh created and led
 

563
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,030
first of all you've uh created and led
the the leg lab the legendary leg Lab at

564
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
the the leg lab the legendary leg Lab at
 

565
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,350
the the leg lab the legendary leg Lab at
MIT so what what was that first hopping

566
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
MIT so what what was that first hopping
 

567
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,590
MIT so what what was that first hopping
robot can you but first of all the leg

568
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
robot can you but first of all the leg
 

569
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,190
robot can you but first of all the leg
lab actually started at Carnegie melon

570
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
lab actually started at Carnegie melon
 

571
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,269
lab actually started at Carnegie melon
Carnegie melon so I was a professor

572
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
Carnegie melon so I was a professor
 

573
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,829
Carnegie melon so I was a professor
there starting uh in 1980 uh in to about

574
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
there starting uh in 1980 uh in to about
 

575
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,430
there starting uh in 1980 uh in to about
1986 and uh so that's where the first

576
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:50,440
1986 and uh so that's where the first
 

577
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,230
1986 and uh so that's where the first
topping machines were built uh starting

578
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,240
topping machines were built uh starting
 

579
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,030
topping machines were built uh starting
I guess we got the first one working in

580
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
I guess we got the first one working in
 

581
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,829
I guess we got the first one working in
about

582
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
about
 

583
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,430
about
1982 something like that that was a

584
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:58,440
1982 something like that that was a
 

585
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,430
1982 something like that that was a
simplified SP one then we got a

586
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:00,440
simplified SP one then we got a
 

587
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,310
simplified SP one then we got a
three-dimensional one in

588
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
three-dimensional one in
 

589
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,829
three-dimensional one in
1983 the quadruped that uh we built at

590
00:12:05,829 --> 00:12:05,839
1983 the quadruped that uh we built at
 

591
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,590
1983 the quadruped that uh we built at
the leg lab the first version was built

592
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:08,600
the leg lab the first version was built
 

593
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,790
the leg lab the first version was built
in about

594
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:09,800
in about
 

595
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,430
in about
19845 and really only got going about 86

596
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:14,440
19845 and really only got going about 86
 

597
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,590
19845 and really only got going about 86
or so and took years of development to

598
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:16,600
or so and took years of development to
 

599
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,509
or so and took years of development to
get it to let's just pause here for

600
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:18,519
get it to let's just pause here for
 

601
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,550
get it to let's just pause here for
people who don't know I'm talking to

602
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:19,560
people who don't know I'm talking to
 

603
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,550
people who don't know I'm talking to
Mark rabert founder Boston Dynamics but

604
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
Mark rabert founder Boston Dynamics but
 

605
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,269
Mark rabert founder Boston Dynamics but
before that you were a professor

606
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
before that you were a professor
 

607
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,110
before that you were a professor
developing some of the most incredible

608
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,120
developing some of the most incredible
 

609
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,150
developing some of the most incredible
robots for 15 years and before that of

610
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,160
robots for 15 years and before that of
 

611
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,870
robots for 15 years and before that of
course a grud and all that so you've

612
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:30,880
course a grud and all that so you've
 

613
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,230
course a grud and all that so you've
been doing this for a really long time

614
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:32,240
been doing this for a really long time
 

615
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,430
been doing this for a really long time
so you like skipped over this but like

616
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:34,440
so you like skipped over this but like
 

617
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,310
so you like skipped over this but like
go go to the first hopping robot there's

618
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
go go to the first hopping robot there's
 

619
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,550
go go to the first hopping robot there's
videos of some of this I mean these are

620
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
videos of some of this I mean these are
 

621
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,990
videos of some of this I mean these are
incredible robots you talked about the F

622
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
incredible robots you talked about the F
 

623
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,030
incredible robots you talked about the F
the very first step was to get a thing

624
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
the very first step was to get a thing
 

625
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,910
the very first step was to get a thing
hopping up and down right and then you

626
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
hopping up and down right and then you
 

627
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,030
hopping up and down right and then you
realized well balancing is the thing you

628
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,040
realized well balancing is the thing you
 

629
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,230
realized well balancing is the thing you
should care about and it's actually a

630
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:52,240
should care about and it's actually a
 

631
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,470
should care about and it's actually a
solvable problem so can you just go

632
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
solvable problem so can you just go
 

633
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,350
solvable problem so can you just go
through how to create that robot what

634
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,360
through how to create that robot what
 

635
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,389
through how to create that robot what
was what sure what was involved in

636
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
was what sure what was involved in
 

637
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,470
was what sure what was involved in
creating that robot well I'm going to

638
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:00,480
creating that robot well I'm going to
 

639
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,710
creating that robot well I'm going to
start on the not the technical side but

640
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:03,720
start on the not the technical side but
 

641
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,949
start on the not the technical side but
the uh I guess we could call it the

642
00:13:05,949 --> 00:13:05,959
the uh I guess we could call it the
 

643
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,150
the uh I guess we could call it the
motivational side or the funding side so

644
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,160
motivational side or the funding side so
 

645
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,269
motivational side or the funding side so
before Carnegie melon I was actually at

646
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
before Carnegie melon I was actually at
 

647
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,269
before Carnegie melon I was actually at
JPL at the jet propulsion lab for three

648
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
JPL at the jet propulsion lab for three
 

649
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,350
JPL at the jet propulsion lab for three
years and while I was there I connected

650
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:16,360
years and while I was there I connected
 

651
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,150
years and while I was there I connected
up with Ivan southernland who is

652
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
up with Ivan southernland who is
 

653
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,030
up with Ivan southernland who is
sometimes regarded as the father of

654
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,040
sometimes regarded as the father of
 

655
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,189
sometimes regarded as the father of
computer Graphics because of work he did

656
00:13:24,189 --> 00:13:24,199
computer Graphics because of work he did
 

657
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:26,470
computer Graphics because of work he did
both at MIT and then University of Utah

658
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480
both at MIT and then University of Utah
 

659
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,629
both at MIT and then University of Utah
and Evans and Southerland anyway

660
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:29,639
and Evans and Southerland anyway
 

661
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,990
and Evans and Southerland anyway
um I got to know him and at one point he

662
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,000
um I got to know him and at one point he
 

663
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,509
um I got to know him and at one point he
said uh he encouraged me to uh do some

664
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:36,519
said uh he encouraged me to uh do some
 

665
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,829
said uh he encouraged me to uh do some
kind of project uh at Caltech even

666
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:38,839
kind of project uh at Caltech even
 

667
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,629
kind of project uh at Caltech even
though I was at JPL you know those are

668
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
though I was at JPL you know those are
 

669
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,990
though I was at JPL you know those are
kind of related

670
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,000
kind of related
 

671
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,189
kind of related
institutions and uh so I I thought about

672
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
institutions and uh so I I thought about
 

673
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,110
institutions and uh so I I thought about
it uh and I made up a list of three

674
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:50,120
it uh and I made up a list of three
 

675
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,110
it uh and I made up a list of three
possible projects and I purposely made

676
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
possible projects and I purposely made
 

677
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,710
possible projects and I purposely made
the top one and the bottom one really

678
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
the top one and the bottom one really
 

679
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,949
the top one and the bottom one really
boring sounding and in the middle I put

680
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:57,959
boring sounding and in the middle I put
 

681
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,910
boring sounding and in the middle I put
uh pogo stick robot and when he looked

682
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:00,920
uh pogo stick robot and when he looked
 

683
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,670
uh pogo stick robot and when he looked
at it you know Ivan is a a brilliant uh

684
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:04,680
at it you know Ivan is a a brilliant uh
 

685
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,269
at it you know Ivan is a a brilliant uh
you know brilliant guy brilliant

686
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:06,279
you know brilliant guy brilliant
 

687
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,870
you know brilliant guy brilliant
engineer and uh real cultivator of

688
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:08,880
engineer and uh real cultivator of
 

689
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,230
engineer and uh real cultivator of
people he looked at it and knew right

690
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:10,240
people he looked at it and knew right
 

691
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,790
people he looked at it and knew right
away what the thing that was worth doing

692
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
away what the thing that was worth doing
 

693
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,710
away what the thing that was worth doing
and so he you know he had an endowed

694
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
and so he you know he had an endowed
 

695
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,710
and so he you know he had an endowed
shair so he had about $3,000 that he

696
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
shair so he had about $3,000 that he
 

697
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,829
shair so he had about $3,000 that he
gave me to build the first model which I

698
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
gave me to build the first model which I
 

699
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,230
gave me to build the first model which I
went you know I went to the shop and

700
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,240
went you know I went to the shop and
 

701
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,389
went you know I went to the shop and
with my own hands kind of made a first

702
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:23,399
with my own hands kind of made a first
 

703
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:27,110
with my own hands kind of made a first
model which which didn't work uh and was

704
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
model which which didn't work uh and was
 

705
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,670
model which which didn't work uh and was
just you know a beginning

706
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
just you know a beginning
 

707
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,230
just you know a beginning
uh shot at it and uh Ivan and I took

708
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:33,240
uh shot at it and uh Ivan and I took
 

709
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,990
uh shot at it and uh Ivan and I took
that to Washington and in those days you

710
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
that to Washington and in those days you
 

711
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,790
that to Washington and in those days you
could just walk into DARPA and walk down

712
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:37,800
could just walk into DARPA and walk down
 

713
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,710
could just walk into DARPA and walk down
the hallway and see who's there and Ivan

714
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:40,720
the hallway and see who's there and Ivan
 

715
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,670
the hallway and see who's there and Ivan
who had been there in his previous life

716
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680
who had been there in his previous life
 

717
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,749
who had been there in his previous life
and so we walked around and uh we looked

718
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:45,759
and so we walked around and uh we looked
 

719
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,389
and so we walked around and uh we looked
in offices of course I didn't know

720
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:47,399
in offices of course I didn't know
 

721
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,110
in offices of course I didn't know
anything you know I was basically a kid

722
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
anything you know I was basically a kid
 

723
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,069
anything you know I was basically a kid
but Ivan knew his way around and we

724
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:51,079
but Ivan knew his way around and we
 

725
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,269
but Ivan knew his way around and we
found Craig Fields uh in his office

726
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:54,279
found Craig Fields uh in his office
 

727
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,110
found Craig Fields uh in his office
Craig later became the director of DARPA

728
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,120
Craig later became the director of DARPA
 

729
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,470
Craig later became the director of DARPA
but in those days he was a program

730
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:57,480
but in those days he was a program
 

731
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,590
but in those days he was a program
manager and so we went in I had a little

732
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600
manager and so we went in I had a little
 

733
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,749
manager and so we went in I had a little
Samsonite suitcase we opened and it had

734
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:02,759
Samsonite suitcase we opened and it had
 

735
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,110
Samsonite suitcase we opened and it had
just the skeleton of this uh on lugged

736
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
just the skeleton of this uh on lugged
 

737
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,509
just the skeleton of this uh on lugged
hopping robot and we showed it to him

738
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
hopping robot and we showed it to him
 

739
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,829
hopping robot and we showed it to him
and uh you could almost see the drool

740
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
and uh you could almost see the drool
 

741
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,829
and uh you could almost see the drool
going down his chin ex excitement and he

742
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:12,839
going down his chin ex excitement and he
 

743
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,030
going down his chin ex excitement and he
sent me $250,000 he said okay uh I'll uh

744
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:18,040
sent me $250,000 he said okay uh I'll uh
 

745
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,509
sent me $250,000 he said okay uh I'll uh
I want to fund this uh and I was between

746
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:20,519
I want to fund this uh and I was between
 

747
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,069
I want to fund this uh and I was between
institutions I was just about to leave

748
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
institutions I was just about to leave
 

749
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,910
institutions I was just about to leave
JPL and I hadn't decided yet where I was

750
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:24,920
JPL and I hadn't decided yet where I was
 

751
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,350
JPL and I hadn't decided yet where I was
going next and then when I landed at CMU

752
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:28,360
going next and then when I landed at CMU
 

753
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,790
going next and then when I landed at CMU
he sent $250,000 which in 1980 was a lot

754
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:31,800
he sent $250,000 which in 1980 was a lot
 

755
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,430
he sent $250,000 which in 1980 was a lot
of a lot of research money did you see

756
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:34,440
of a lot of research money did you see
 

757
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,430
of a lot of research money did you see
the possibility of where this is going

758
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:36,440
the possibility of where this is going
 

759
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,550
the possibility of where this is going
why this is an important problem no the

760
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:39,560
why this is an important problem no the
 

761
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,910
why this is an important problem no the
balancing I mean it's legged it it has

762
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:41,920
balancing I mean it's legged it it has
 

763
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,069
balancing I mean it's legged it it has
to do with legged Locomotion I mean it

764
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
to do with legged Locomotion I mean it
 

765
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,430
to do with legged Locomotion I mean it
has to do with all these problems that

766
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:46,440
has to do with all these problems that
 

767
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,670
has to do with all these problems that
that that are the human body solves them

768
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:48,680
that that are the human body solves them
 

769
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,069
that that are the human body solves them
when we're walking for example like all

770
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
when we're walking for example like all
 

771
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,389
when we're walking for example like all
the fundamentals are there yeah I mean I

772
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
the fundamentals are there yeah I mean I
 

773
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,470
the fundamentals are there yeah I mean I
think that was the motivation to try and

774
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
think that was the motivation to try and
 

775
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,990
think that was the motivation to try and
get more at the fundamentals of how

776
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,000
get more at the fundamentals of how
 

777
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,150
get more at the fundamentals of how
animals work but the idea that it would

778
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
animals work but the idea that it would
 

779
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,430
animals work but the idea that it would
result in you know machines that were

780
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:00,440
result in you know machines that were
 

781
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,910
result in you know machines that were
anything like practical uh like we're

782
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:02,920
anything like practical uh like we're
 

783
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,710
anything like practical uh like we're

00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
robot so what was on the technical side
 

797
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,350
robot so what was on the technical side
what are the some of the challenges of

798
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
what are the some of the challenges of
 

799
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,710
what are the some of the challenges of
getting a getting to the point where we

800
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:23,720
getting a getting to the point where we
 

801
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,829
getting a getting to the point where we
saw like in the video the the pogo stick

802
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:26,839
saw like in the video the the pogo stick
 

803
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,150
saw like in the video the the pogo stick
robot that's actually successfully

804
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
robot that's actually successfully
 

805
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,829
robot that's actually successfully
hopping and then eventually doing flips

806
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
hopping and then eventually doing flips
 

807
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,749
hopping and then eventually doing flips
and all this kind of stuff well in the

808
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
and all this kind of stuff well in the
 

809
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,910
and all this kind of stuff well in the
very early days I needed some better

810
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
very early days I needed some better
 

811
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,150
very early days I needed some better
engineering than I had than I could do

812
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
engineering than I had than I could do
 

813
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,829
engineering than I had than I could do
myself and I hired uh Ben Brown we we

814
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
myself and I hired uh Ben Brown we we
 

815
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,949
myself and I hired uh Ben Brown we we
each had our way of contributing to the

816
00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:41,959
each had our way of contributing to the
 

817
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,309
each had our way of contributing to the
design and we came up with a thing that

818
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:44,319
design and we came up with a thing that
 

819
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,910
design and we came up with a thing that
could could start to work I had some

820
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:46,920
could could start to work I had some
 

821
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,949
could could start to work I had some
stupid ideas about how the actuation

822
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
stupid ideas about how the actuation
 

823
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,350
stupid ideas about how the actuation
system should work and uh we you know we

824
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
system should work and uh we you know we
 

825
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,749
system should work and uh we you know we
sorted that out it wasn't that hard to

826
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
sorted that out it wasn't that hard to
 

827
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,110
sorted that out it wasn't that hard to
make it Balan once you get the the

828
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,120
make it Balan once you get the the
 

829
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,790
make it Balan once you get the the
physical machine to be working well

830
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:57,800
physical machine to be working well
 

831
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,990
physical machine to be working well
enough uh and have enough control over

832
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
enough uh and have enough control over
 

833
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,150
enough uh and have enough control over
the degrees of freedom uh and then we

834
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,160
the degrees of freedom uh and then we
 

835
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,949
the degrees of freedom uh and then we
very quickly you know we started out by

836
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959
very quickly you know we started out by
 

837
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,150
very quickly you know we started out by
having it floating on an inclined air

838
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,160
having it floating on an inclined air
 

839
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,990
having it floating on an inclined air
table and then uh that only gave us like

840
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
table and then uh that only gave us like
 

841
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,949
table and then uh that only gave us like
six foot of travel so once it started

842
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:11,959
six foot of travel so once it started
 

843
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:14,710
six foot of travel so once it started
working we switched to a thing that

844
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:14,720
working we switched to a thing that
 

845
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,069
working we switched to a thing that
could run around the room on a another

846
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,079
could run around the room on a another
 

847
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,590
could run around the room on a another
device it's hard to explain these

848
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,600
device it's hard to explain these
 

849
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,150
device it's hard to explain these
without you seeing them but you probably

850
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
without you seeing them but you probably
 

851
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,549
without you seeing them but you probably
know what I'm talking about a plan

852
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:21,559
know what I'm talking about a plan
 

853
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:24,590
know what I'm talking about a plan
ariser and uh and then the next big step

854
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:24,600
ariser and uh and then the next big step
 

855
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,750
ariser and uh and then the next big step
was to make it work in 3D which that was

856
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:26,760
was to make it work in 3D which that was
 

857
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,150
was to make it work in 3D which that was
really the scary part would the simple

858
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,160
really the scary part would the simple
 

859
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,430
really the scary part would the simple
things you know people had inverted

860
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,440
things you know people had inverted
 

861
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,669
things you know people had inverted
pendulums at the time for for years and

862
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:32,679
pendulums at the time for for years and
 

863
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,230
pendulums at the time for for years and
they could control them by driving a

864
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
they could control them by driving a
 

865
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,150
they could control them by driving a
cart back and forth but could you make

866
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,160
cart back and forth but could you make
 

867
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,470
cart back and forth but could you make
it work in three dimensions while it's

868
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
it work in three dimensions while it's
 

869
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,630
it work in three dimensions while it's
bouncing and all that and uh but it

870
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:40,640
bouncing and all that and uh but it
 

871
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,390
bouncing and all that and uh but it
turned out you know not to be that hard

872
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
turned out you know not to be that hard
 

873
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,710
turned out you know not to be that hard
to do uh at least at the level of

874
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
to do uh at least at the level of
 

875
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,789
to do uh at least at the level of
performance we achieved at the time so

876
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
performance we achieved at the time so
 

877
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,430
performance we achieved at the time so
okay you mentioned inverted pendulum but

878
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:48,440
okay you mentioned inverted pendulum but
 

879
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,950
okay you mentioned inverted pendulum but
like uh can you explain how a Hopping

880
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:51,960
like uh can you explain how a Hopping
 

881
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,630
like uh can you explain how a Hopping
stick in 3D can

882
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:55,640
stick in 3D can
 

883
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,630
stick in 3D can
control can balance itself yeah what

884
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:58,640
control can balance itself yeah what
 

885
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,230
control can balance itself yeah what
what does the actuation look like uh you

886
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,240
what does the actuation look like uh you
 

887
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,750
what does the actuation look like uh you
know the simple story is that there's

888
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:02,760
know the simple story is that there's
 

889
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,110
know the simple story is that there's
three things going on there's something

890
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
three things going on there's something
 

891
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,789
three things going on there's something
making it bounce and you know we we had

892
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:07,799
making it bounce and you know we we had
 

893
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,630
making it bounce and you know we we had
a system that was uh estimating how high

894
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:11,640
a system that was uh estimating how high
 

895
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,070
a system that was uh estimating how high
the robot was off the ground and using

896
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
the robot was off the ground and using
 

897
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,310
the robot was off the ground and using
that you know uh there's energy that can

898
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:17,320
that you know uh there's energy that can
 

899
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,710
that you know uh there's energy that can
be in three places in a in a pogo stick

900
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:19,720
be in three places in a in a pogo stick
 

901
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,990
be in three places in a in a pogo stick
one is in the spring one is in the

902
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
one is in the spring one is in the
 

903
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,909
one is in the spring one is in the
altitude and the other is in the

904
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
altitude and the other is in the
 

905
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,149
altitude and the other is in the
velocity and so when at the top of the

906
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:26,159
velocity and so when at the top of the
 

907
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:29,510
velocity and so when at the top of the
Hop it's all in the the a height and so

908
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
Hop it's all in the the a height and so
 

909
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,149
Hop it's all in the the a height and so
you could just measure how high you're

910
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:31,159
you could just measure how high you're
 

911
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,950
you could just measure how high you're
going and thereby thereby have an idea

912
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:33,960
going and thereby thereby have an idea
 

913
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,909
going and thereby thereby have an idea
of a lot about the cycle and you could

914
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:35,919
of a lot about the cycle and you could
 

915
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,070
of a lot about the cycle and you could
decide whether to put more energy in or

916
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
decide whether to put more energy in or
 

917
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,390
decide whether to put more energy in or
less so that was one element then

918
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
less so that was one element then
 

919
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,390
less so that was one element then
there's a part that you decide where to

920
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
there's a part that you decide where to
 

921
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,510
there's a part that you decide where to
put the foot and if you think when

922
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:44,520
put the foot and if you think when
 

923
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,870
put the foot and if you think when
you're landing on the ground with

924
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:45,880
you're landing on the ground with
 

925
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,630
you're landing on the ground with
respect to the center Mass so if you

926
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:47,640
respect to the center Mass so if you
 

927
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,029
respect to the center Mass so if you
think of a pole vter the key thing the

928
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:50,039
think of a pole vter the key thing the
 

929
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,789
think of a pole vter the key thing the
pole vter has to do is get its body to

930
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:53,799
pole vter has to do is get its body to
 

931
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,190
pole vter has to do is get its body to
the right place when the pole gets stuck

932
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,200
the right place when the pole gets stuck
 

933
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,990
the right place when the pole gets stuck
if they're too far forward uh they kind

934
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,000
if they're too far forward uh they kind
 

935
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,310
if they're too far forward uh they kind
of get thrown backwards if they're too

936
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:01,320
of get thrown backwards if they're too
 

937
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,710
of get thrown backwards if they're too
far back they go you know over and what

938
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:03,720
far back they go you know over and what
 

939
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,110
far back they go you know over and what
they need to do is get it so that they

940
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
they need to do is get it so that they
 

941
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,789
they need to do is get it so that they
go mostly up to get over the thing and

942
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:07,799
go mostly up to get over the thing and
 

943
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,950
go mostly up to get over the thing and
you know High jumpers is the same kind

944
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:09,960
you know High jumpers is the same kind
 

945
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,710
you know High jumpers is the same kind
of thing so there's a calculation about

946
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:12,720
of thing so there's a calculation about
 

947
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,470
of thing so there's a calculation about
where to put the foot and we did

948
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
where to put the foot and we did
 

949
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,549
where to put the foot and we did
something you know relatively simple and

950
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
something you know relatively simple and
 

951
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,230
something you know relatively simple and
then there's a third part to keep the

952
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
then there's a third part to keep the
 

953
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,310
then there's a third part to keep the
body at an attitude that's upright

954
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
body at an attitude that's upright
 

955
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,110
body at an attitude that's upright
because if it gets too far you know you

956
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,120
because if it gets too far you know you
 

957
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,669
because if it gets too far you know you
could hopen just keep rotating around

958
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:24,679
could hopen just keep rotating around
 

959
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,390
could hopen just keep rotating around
but if it gets too far then you run out

960
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:27,400
but if it gets too far then you run out
 

961
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,430
but if it gets too far then you run out
of Mo of the joints at the hips so you

962
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:30,440
of Mo of the joints at the hips so you
 

963
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,070
of Mo of the joints at the hips so you
have to do that and we did that by

964
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,080
have to do that and we did that by
 

965
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,830
have to do that and we did that by
applying a torque between the legs and

966
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:34,840
applying a torque between the legs and
 

967
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,390
applying a torque between the legs and
the body every time the foot's on the

968
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
the body every time the foot's on the
 

969
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,470
the body every time the foot's on the
ground you only can do it while the

970
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:37,480
ground you only can do it while the
 

971
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,870
ground you only can do it while the
foot's on the ground in the air you know

972
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:39,880
foot's on the ground in the air you know
 

973
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,029
foot's on the ground in the air you know
it it it the physics don't work out how

974
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:43,039
it it it the physics don't work out how
 

975
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,950
it it it the physics don't work out how
far does it have to tilt before it's too

976
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:44,960
far does it have to tilt before it's too
 

977
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,149
far does it have to tilt before it's too
late to be able to balance itself or

978
00:19:47,149 --> 00:19:47,159
late to be able to balance itself or
 

979
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:48,669
late to be able to balance itself or
it's impossible to balance itself

980
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:48,679
it's impossible to balance itself
 

981
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,350
it's impossible to balance itself
correct itself well you're you're asking

982
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
correct itself well you're you're asking
 

983
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,789
correct itself well you're you're asking
interesting question because

984
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:53,799
interesting question because
 

985
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:57,390
interesting question because
um in those days we didn't actually

986
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:57,400
um in those days we didn't actually
 

987
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,310
um in those days we didn't actually
optimize things and they probably could

988
00:19:59,310 --> 00:19:59,320
optimize things and they probably could
 

989
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,029
optimize things and they probably could
have gone much further than we did and

990
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
have gone much further than we did and
 

991
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,270
have gone much further than we did and
then had higher performance and we just

992
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,280
then had higher performance and we just
 

993
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,070
then had higher performance and we just
kind of got you know a sketch of a

994
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,080
kind of got you know a sketch of a
 

995
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,549
kind of got you know a sketch of a
solution and worked on that and then in

996
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:07,559
solution and worked on that and then in
 

997
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:09,230
solution and worked on that and then in
years since some people working for us

998
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,240
years since some people working for us
 

999
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,110
years since some people working for us
some people working for others people

1000
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
some people working for others people
 

1001
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,190
some people working for others people
came up with all kinds of uh equations

1002
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,200
came up with all kinds of uh equations
 

1003
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,710
came up with all kinds of uh equations
for or you know algorithms for how to do

1004
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:16,720
for or you know algorithms for how to do
 

1005
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,070
for or you know algorithms for how to do
a better job be able to go faster one of

1006
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
a better job be able to go faster one of
 

1007
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,470
a better job be able to go faster one of
my students worked on getting things to

1008
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:21,480
my students worked on getting things to
 

1009
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,510
my students worked on getting things to
go faster another one worked on uh

1010
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:24,520
go faster another one worked on uh
 

1011
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,950
go faster another one worked on uh
climbing over obstacles cuz when you're

1012
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
climbing over obstacles cuz when you're
 

1013
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,590
climbing over obstacles cuz when you're
running it's on the open ground it's one

1014
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:29,600
running it's on the open ground it's one
 

1015
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,470
running it's on the open ground it's one
thing if you're running like up a stair

1016
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
thing if you're running like up a stair
 

1017
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,549
thing if you're running like up a stair
uh you have to adjust where you are

1018
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:34,559
uh you have to adjust where you are
 

1019
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,990
uh you have to adjust where you are
otherwise things don't work out right

1020
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,000
otherwise things don't work out right
 

1021
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,510
otherwise things don't work out right
you land your foot on the edge of the

1022
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,520
you land your foot on the edge of the
 

1023
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,149
you land your foot on the edge of the
steps so there's other degrees of

1024
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:39,159
steps so there's other degrees of
 

1025
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:41,590
steps so there's other degrees of
freedom to control if you're getting to

1026
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
freedom to control if you're getting to
 

1027
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,029
freedom to control if you're getting to
you know more realistic practical

1028
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
you know more realistic practical
 

1029
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,510
you know more realistic practical
situations I think it's really

1030
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:44,520
situations I think it's really
 

1031
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,110
situations I think it's really
interesting to ask about the early days

1032
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,120
interesting to ask about the early days
 

1033
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,070
interesting to ask about the early days
cuz you know believing in yourself

1034
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,080
cuz you know believing in yourself
 

1035
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,110
cuz you know believing in yourself
believing that there's something

1036
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,120
believing that there's something
 

1037
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,750
believing that there's something
interesting here and then you mentioned

1038
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,760
interesting here and then you mentioned
 

1039
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,909
interesting here and then you mentioned
find finding somebody else Ben Brown

1040
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:53,919
find finding somebody else Ben Brown
 

1041
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,510
find finding somebody else Ben Brown
what's that like finding other people

1042
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:55,520
what's that like finding other people
 

1043
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,830
what's that like finding other people
with whom you can build this crazy idea

1044
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:58,840
with whom you can build this crazy idea
 

1045
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,789
with whom you can build this crazy idea
and actually make it work probably the

1046
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
and actually make it work probably the
 

1047
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,110
and actually make it work probably the
smartest thing I ever did is to find the

1048
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
smartest thing I ever did is to find the
 

1049
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,990
smartest thing I ever did is to find the
other people I mean when I look at it

1050
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,000
other people I mean when I look at it
 

1051
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,549
other people I mean when I look at it
now you know I look at Boston Dynamics

1052
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:06,559
now you know I look at Boston Dynamics
 

1053
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,350
now you know I look at Boston Dynamics
and all the really excellent engineering

1054
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
and all the really excellent engineering
 

1055
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,029
and all the really excellent engineering
there you know people who really make

1056
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039
there you know people who really make
 

1057
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,149
there you know people who really make
stuff work you know I'm I'm only the the

1058
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:15,159
stuff work you know I'm I'm only the the
 

1059
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:17,909
stuff work you know I'm I'm only the the
dreamer so when you talk about pogo

1060
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:17,919
dreamer so when you talk about pogo
 

1061
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,070
dreamer so when you talk about pogo
stick robot or legged robots whether

1062
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,080
stick robot or legged robots whether
 

1063
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,390
stick robot or legged robots whether
it's quadrupeds or humanoid robots did

1064
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
it's quadrupeds or humanoid robots did
 

1065
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,830
it's quadrupeds or humanoid robots did
people doubt that this is possible did

1066
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:26,840
people doubt that this is possible did
 

1067
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,230
people doubt that this is possible did
you experience a lot of people around

1068
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
you experience a lot of people around
 

1069
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,190
you experience a lot of people around
you kind of I don't I don't know if they

1070
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,200
you kind of I don't I don't know if they
 

1071
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,630
you kind of I don't I don't know if they
doubted whether it was possible but I

1072
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:31,640
doubted whether it was possible but I
 

1073
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,549
doubted whether it was possible but I
think they thought it was a waste of

1074
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:33,559
think they thought it was a waste of
 

1075
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,870
think they thought it was a waste of
time oh it's not even an interesting

1076
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:35,880
time oh it's not even an interesting
 

1077
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,750
time oh it's not even an interesting
problem I think for a lot of people you

1078
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:37,760
problem I think for a lot of people you
 

1079
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,630
problem I think for a lot of people you
know people who were I think it's been

1080
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
know people who were I think it's been
 

1081
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,350
know people who were I think it's been
it's been both though some people I

1082
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
it's been both though some people I
 

1083
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,789
it's been both though some people I
think I felt like they were saying oh

1084
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:45,799
think I felt like they were saying oh
 

1085
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,470
think I felt like they were saying oh
you know why you wasting your time on

1086
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:47,480
you know why you wasting your time on
 

1087
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,990
you know why you wasting your time on
this stupid problem and then but then

1088
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
this stupid problem and then but then
 

1089
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,110
this stupid problem and then but then
I've been at many things where uh people

1090
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,120
I've been at many things where uh people
 

1091
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,430
I've been at many things where uh people
have told me it's been an inspiration to

1092
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:54,440
have told me it's been an inspiration to
 

1093
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,110
have told me it's been an inspiration to
uh to go out and uh you know attack

1094
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:57,120
uh to go out and uh you know attack
 

1095
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,830
uh to go out and uh you know attack
these uh

1096
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:58,840
these uh
 

1097
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,350
these uh
these harder things and and I think it

1098
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,360
these harder things and and I think it
 

1099
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,230
these harder things and and I think it
has turned out I think legged Locomotion

1100
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,240
has turned out I think legged Locomotion
 

1101
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,470
has turned out I think legged Locomotion
has turned out to be a useful thing did

1102
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,480
has turned out to be a useful thing did
 

1103
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,190
has turned out to be a useful thing did
you ever have like doubt about bringing

1104
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:09,200
you ever have like doubt about bringing
 

1105
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,909
you ever have like doubt about bringing
Atlas to life for example or or or with

1106
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:11,919
Atlas to life for example or or or with
 

1107
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,190
Atlas to life for example or or or with
big dog just every step of the way did

1108
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,200
big dog just every step of the way did
 

1109
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,669
big dog just every step of the way did
you have doubt like what this is this is

1110
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:16,679
you have doubt like what this is this is
 

1111
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,630
you have doubt like what this is this is
too hard of a problem I mean at first I

1112
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:19,640
too hard of a problem I mean at first I
 

1113
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,710
too hard of a problem I mean at first I
wasn't an Enthusiast for the humanoids

1114
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:21,720
wasn't an Enthusiast for the humanoids
 

1115
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,310
wasn't an Enthusiast for the humanoids
because again it goes back to saying

1116
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
because again it goes back to saying
 

1117
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,750
because again it goes back to saying
what's the functionality and the form

1118
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:26,760
what's the functionality and the form
 

1119
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,750
what's the functionality and the form
wasn't as important as the

1120
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:28,760
wasn't as important as the
 

1121
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,750
wasn't as important as the
functionality uh and I and also you know

1122
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:32,760
functionality uh and I and also you know
 

1123
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,110
functionality uh and I and also you know
there's a an aspect to humanoid robots

1124
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
there's a an aspect to humanoid robots
 

1125
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,029
there's a an aspect to humanoid robots
that's about uh all about the Cosmetics

1126
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:38,039
that's about uh all about the Cosmetics
 

1127
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,269
that's about uh all about the Cosmetics
where there isn't really other

1128
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:39,279
where there isn't really other
 

1129
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,870
where there isn't really other
functionality and that kind of is

1130
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:40,880
functionality and that kind of is
 

1131
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,990
functionality and that kind of is
offputting for me uh as a roboticist I

1132
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
offputting for me uh as a roboticist I
 

1133
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,990
offputting for me uh as a roboticist I
think the functionality really matters

1134
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,000
think the functionality really matters
 

1135
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,549
think the functionality really matters
so probably that's why I avoided uh

1136
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
so probably that's why I avoided uh
 

1137
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,909
so probably that's why I avoided uh
human robots humanoid robots to start

1138
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:50,919
human robots humanoid robots to start
 

1139
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:54,669
human robots humanoid robots to start
with but I'll tell you um now you know

1140
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:54,679
with but I'll tell you um now you know
 

1141
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:55,950
with but I'll tell you um now you know
after we started working on them you

1142
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:55,960
after we started working on them you
 

1143
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,630
after we started working on them you
could see that the the connection and

1144
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:57,640
could see that the the connection and
 

1145
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,510
could see that the the connection and
the impact with with other people

1146
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:00,520
the impact with with other people
 

1147
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,310
the impact with with other people
whether they're lay people or even other

1148
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:03,320
whether they're lay people or even other
 

1149
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,669
whether they're lay people or even other
technical people uh there's a there's a

1150
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
technical people uh there's a there's a
 

1151
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,470
technical people uh there's a there's a
a special thing that goes on uh even

1152
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
a special thing that goes on uh even
 

1153
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,789
a special thing that goes on uh even
though most of the humanoid robots

1154
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:09,799
though most of the humanoid robots
 

1155
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,789
though most of the humanoid robots
aren't that much like a person but we

1156
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:11,799
aren't that much like a person but we
 

1157
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,470
aren't that much like a person but we
anthropomorphize and we see the humanity

1158
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:15,480
anthropomorphize and we see the humanity
 

1159
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,149
anthropomorphize and we see the humanity
U but also like with with spot you can

1160
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
U but also like with with spot you can
 

1161
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,870
U but also like with with spot you can
see not the humanity but the what

1162
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
see not the humanity but the what
 

1163
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,390
see not the humanity but the what
whatever we find compelling about social

1164
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:23,400
whatever we find compelling about social
 

1165
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,350
whatever we find compelling about social
interactions there in spot as well I'll

1166
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,360
interactions there in spot as well I'll
 

1167
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,549
interactions there in spot as well I'll
tell you you know I go around giving

1168
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
tell you you know I go around giving
 

1169
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,510
tell you you know I go around giving
talks and take spot to to a lot of them

1170
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
talks and take spot to to a lot of them
 

1171
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,750
talks and take spot to to a lot of them
and it's amazing the media likes to say

1172
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:31,760
and it's amazing the media likes to say
 

1173
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,630
and it's amazing the media likes to say
that they're terrifying and and that

1174
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:33,640
that they're terrifying and and that
 

1175
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,950
that they're terrifying and and that
people are afraid and and YouTube

1176
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:35,960
people are afraid and and YouTube
 

1177
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,990
people are afraid and and YouTube
commenters like to say that it's

1178
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,000
commenters like to say that it's
 

1179
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,350
commenters like to say that it's
frightening but when you take a spot out

1180
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:40,360
frightening but when you take a spot out
 

1181
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,789
frightening but when you take a spot out
there now maybe it's self- selecting but

1182
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:42,799
there now maybe it's self- selecting but
 

1183
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,710
there now maybe it's self- selecting but
you get a crowd of people who want to

1184
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:44,720
you get a crowd of people who want to
 

1185
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,190
you get a crowd of people who want to
take pictures want to pose for selfies

1186
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,200
take pictures want to pose for selfies
 

1187
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,269
take pictures want to pose for selfies
want to operate the robot want to pet it

1188
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
want to operate the robot want to pet it
 

1189
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,750
want to operate the robot want to pet it
want to put clothes on it uh it's

1190
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
want to put clothes on it uh it's
 

1191
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,549
want to put clothes on it uh it's
amazing yeah love spot so if we uh move

1192
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:55,559
amazing yeah love spot so if we uh move
 

1193
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,750
amazing yeah love spot so if we uh move
around history a little bit so you said

1194
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:58,760
around history a little bit so you said
 

1195
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,110
around history a little bit so you said
I think in the early days of Boston

1196
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,120
I think in the early days of Boston
 

1197
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,710
I think in the early days of Boston
Dynamics that you quietly worked on

1198
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:01,720
Dynamics that you quietly worked on
 

1199
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,470
Dynamics that you quietly worked on
making a running version of IBO yeah

1200

interesting uh little tidbit of history

1204
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:09,440
interesting uh little tidbit of history
 

1205
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,470
interesting uh little tidbit of history
for me um what what what like what

1206
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
for me um what what what like what
 

1207
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,110
for me um what what what like what
stands out to your memory from that task

1208
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
stands out to your memory from that task
 

1209
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,070
stands out to your memory from that task
for people don't know that little dog

1210
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,080
for people don't know that little dog

robot moves slowly how did that become

1212
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
robot moves slowly how did that become
 

1213
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,430
robot moves slowly how did that become
big dog what was involved there what was

1214
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:22,440
big dog what was involved there what was
 

1215
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,190
big dog what was involved there what was
the dance between how do we make this

1216
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:24,200
the dance between how do we make this
 

1217
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,070
the dance between how do we make this
cute little dog versus a thing that can

1218
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
cute little dog versus a thing that can
 

1219
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,590
cute little dog versus a thing that can
actually carry a lot of payload to move

1220
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
actually carry a lot of payload to move
 

1221
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,430
actually carry a lot of payload to move
fast and stuff like that what the

1222
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,440
fast and stuff like that what the
 

1223
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,669
fast and stuff like that what the
connection was is that at that point

1224
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,679
connection was is that at that point
 

1225
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,269

Boston Dynamics was mostly a

1226
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
Boston Dynamics was mostly a
 

1227
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,789
Boston Dynamics was mostly a
physics-based simulation company so when

1228
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:35,799
physics-based simulation company so when
 

1229
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:39,070
physics-based simulation company so when
I left MIT to start Boston Dynamics you

1230
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,080
I left MIT to start Boston Dynamics you
 

1231
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,430
I left MIT to start Boston Dynamics you
know there was a few years of overlap

1232
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:40,440
know there was a few years of overlap
 

1233
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,149
know there was a few years of overlap
but the concept wasn't to start a robot

1234
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
but the concept wasn't to start a robot
 

1235
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,549
but the concept wasn't to start a robot
company the concept was to use this uh

1236
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:45,559
company the concept was to use this uh
 

1237
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,149
company the concept was to use this uh
Dynamic simulation tool that we

1238
00:24:47,149 --> 00:24:47,159
Dynamic simulation tool that we
 

1239
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,990
Dynamic simulation tool that we
developed to do robotics to for other

1240
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
developed to do robotics to for other
 

1241
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,990
developed to do robotics to for other
things uh but working with Sony we got

1242
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,000
things uh but working with Sony we got
 

1243
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,470
things uh but working with Sony we got
back into robotics uh by doing the IBO

1244
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,480
back into robotics uh by doing the IBO
 

1245
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,909
back into robotics uh by doing the IBO
Runner by we programmed we made made

1246
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
Runner by we programmed we made made
 

1247
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,549
Runner by we programmed we made made
some tools for programming curio uh

1248
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:00,559
some tools for programming curio uh
 

1249
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,310
some tools for programming curio uh
which was a small a humanoid this big uh

1250
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,320
which was a small a humanoid this big uh
 

1251
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,269
which was a small a humanoid this big uh
that could do some dancing and and other

1252
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
that could do some dancing and and other
 

1253
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,230
that could do some dancing and and other
kinds of fun stuff and I don't think it

1254
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:07,240
kinds of fun stuff and I don't think it
 

1255
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,350
kinds of fun stuff and I don't think it
ever reached the market even though they

1256
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
ever reached the market even though they
 

1257
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,470
ever reached the market even though they
they did show it um you know when I look

1258
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:12,480
they did show it um you know when I look
 

1259
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,230
they did show it um you know when I look
back I say that we got us back where we

1260
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
back I say that we got us back where we
 

1261
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,909
back I say that we got us back where we
belonged yeah you rediscovered the soul

1262
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:16,919
belonged yeah you rediscovered the soul
 

1263
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,389
belonged yeah you rediscovered the soul
of the company that's right and so from

1264
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:19,399
of the company that's right and so from
 

1265
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:22,310
of the company that's right and so from
there it was always about robots

1266
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:22,320
there it was always about robots
 

1267
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,590
there it was always about robots
yeah uh so you started Boston Dynamics

1268
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:25,600
yeah uh so you started Boston Dynamics
 

1269
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,510
yeah uh so you started Boston Dynamics
in

1270
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:26,520
in
 

1271
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,190
in
1992 right uh what are some fond

1272
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,200
1992 right uh what are some fond
 

1273
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,950
1992 right uh what are some fond
memories from the early

1274
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:30,960
memories from the early
 

1275
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,710
memories from the early
days uh one of the robots that we built

1276
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
days uh one of the robots that we built
 

1277
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,990
days uh one of the robots that we built
wasn't wasn't actually robot it was a

1278
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,000
wasn't wasn't actually robot it was a
 

1279
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,590
wasn't wasn't actually robot it was a
surgical simulator but it had force

1280
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
surgical simulator but it had force
 

1281
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,350
surgical simulator but it had force
feedback so it had all the techniques of

1282
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,360
feedback so it had all the techniques of
 

1283
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,110
feedback so it had all the techniques of
Robotics and you look down into this uh

1284
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,120
Robotics and you look down into this uh
 

1285
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,190
Robotics and you look down into this uh
mirror it actually was and it looked

1286
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:48,200
mirror it actually was and it looked
 

1287
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,230
mirror it actually was and it looked
like you were looking down onto the body

1288
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
like you were looking down onto the body
 

1289
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,870
like you were looking down onto the body
you were working on your hands were

1290
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:51,880
you were working on your hands were
 

1291
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,510
you were working on your hands were
underneath the mirror so there were

1292
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
underneath the mirror so there were
 

1293
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,830
underneath the mirror so there were
where you were looking and you had Tools

1294
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:55,840
where you were looking and you had Tools
 

1295
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,630
where you were looking and you had Tools
in your hands that were connected up to

1296
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:57,640
in your hands that were connected up to
 

1297
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,350
in your hands that were connected up to
to these force feedback devices made by

1298
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:00,360
to these force feedback devices made by
 

1299
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,630
to these force feedback devices made by
uh another MIT spinout sensible

1300
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
uh another MIT spinout sensible
 

1301
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,549
uh another MIT spinout sensible
Technologies so they made the force

1302
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
Technologies so they made the force
 

1303
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,310
Technologies so they made the force
feedback device we attached the tools

1304
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
feedback device we attached the tools
 

1305
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,630
feedback device we attached the tools
and we wrote all the software and did

1306
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
and we wrote all the software and did
 

1307
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,190
and we wrote all the software and did
all the graphics so we had 3D computer

1308
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,200
all the graphics so we had 3D computer
 

1309
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,950
all the graphics so we had 3D computer
Graphics it was in the old days when

1310
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960
Graphics it was in the old days when
 

1311
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,710
Graphics it was in the old days when
this was in the late 90s when you had uh

1312
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:15,720
this was in the late 90s when you had uh
 

1313
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,669
this was in the late 90s when you had uh
the Silicon Graphics computer that was

1314
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
the Silicon Graphics computer that was
 

1315
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,669
the Silicon Graphics computer that was
about this big uh you know it was the

1316
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:20,679
about this big uh you know it was the
 

1317
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:24,230
about this big uh you know it was the
heater in the office basically and uh

1318
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
heater in the office basically and uh
 

1319
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,669
heater in the office basically and uh
and we were doing uh surgical operations

1320
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:26,679
and we were doing uh surgical operations
 

1321
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,830
and we were doing uh surgical operations
Anastos is which was uh stitching tubes

1322
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:29,840
Anastos is which was uh stitching tubes
 

1323
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,269
Anastos is which was uh stitching tubes
together you know tubes like blood

1324
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:31,279
together you know tubes like blood
 

1325
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,630
together you know tubes like blood
vessels or other things in their body

1326
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:33,640
vessels or other things in their body
 

1327
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,830
vessels or other things in their body
and you could feel and you could see the

1328
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:35,840
and you could feel and you could see the
 

1329
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,710
and you could feel and you could see the
tissues move and it was really exciting

1330
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
tissues move and it was really exciting
 

1331
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,669
tissues move and it was really exciting
and the idea was to make a trainer to

1332
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:40,679
and the idea was to make a trainer to
 

1333
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,149
and the idea was to make a trainer to
teach surgeons how to do stuff we built

1334
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:43,159
teach surgeons how to do stuff we built
 

1335
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:45,669
teach surgeons how to do stuff we built
a scoring system because we interviewed

1336
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:45,679
a scoring system because we interviewed
 

1337
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,510
a scoring system because we interviewed
uh surgeons that told us you know what

1338
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:48,520
uh surgeons that told us you know what
 

1339
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,510
uh surgeons that told us you know what
you're supposed to do and what you're

1340
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
you're supposed to do and what you're
 

1341
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,870
you're supposed to do and what you're
not supposed to do you're not supposed

1342
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
not supposed to do you're not supposed
 

1343
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,990
not supposed to do you're not supposed
to tear the tissue you're not supposed

1344
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,000
to tear the tissue you're not supposed
 

1345
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,750
to tear the tissue you're not supposed
to touch it in any place except for

1346
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:54,760
to touch it in any place except for
 

1347
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,269
to touch it in any place except for
where you're trying to engage there were

1348
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:56,279
where you're trying to engage there were
 

1349
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,470
where you're trying to engage there were
a bunch of rules so we built this thing

1350
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
a bunch of rules so we built this thing
 

1351
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,669
a bunch of rules so we built this thing
and took it to a trade show uh a

1352
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:00,679
and took it to a trade show uh a
 

1353
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:03,110
and took it to a trade show uh a
surgical trade show and the surgeons

1354
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
surgical trade show and the surgeons
 

1355
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,590
surgical trade show and the surgeons
were practically lined up well we we

1356
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:05,600
were practically lined up well we we
 

1357
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,070
were practically lined up well we we
kept the score and we posted their

1358
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:07,080
kept the score and we posted their
 

1359
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,149
kept the score and we posted their
scores like on a video game and those

1360
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:09,159
scores like on a video game and those
 

1361
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,909
scores like on a video game and those
guys are so competitive that they really

1362
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
guys are so competitive that they really
 

1363
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,909
guys are so competitive that they really
uh really love doing it and they would

1364
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:13,919
uh really love doing it and they would
 

1365
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,269
uh really love doing it and they would
come around and they see someone's score

1366
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
come around and they see someone's score
 

1367
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,950
come around and they see someone's score
was higher there so they would come back

1368
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:17,960
was higher there so they would come back
 

1369
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,909
was higher there so they would come back
but we figured out shortly after that we

1370
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:20,919
but we figured out shortly after that we
 

1371
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:23,190
but we figured out shortly after that we
thought surgeons were going to pay us to

1372
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
thought surgeons were going to pay us to
 

1373
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,590
thought surgeons were going to pay us to
get trained on these things and the

1374
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
get trained on these things and the
 

1375
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,909
get trained on these things and the
surgeons thought we should pay them in

1376
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:27,919
surgeons thought we should pay them in
 

1377
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,029
surgeons thought we should pay them in
order to uh so they could teach us about

1378
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:31,039
order to uh so they could teach us about
 

1379
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,830
order to uh so they could teach us about
the thing and there was no money from

1380
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:32,840
the thing and there was no money from
 

1381
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,029
the thing and there was no money from
the surgeons and we looked at it and

1382
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
the surgeons and we looked at it and
 

1383
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,669
the surgeons and we looked at it and
thought well maybe we could sell it to

1384
00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:36,679
thought well maybe we could sell it to
 

1385
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:38,230
thought well maybe we could sell it to
hospitals that would teach train their

1386
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
hospitals that would teach train their
 

1387
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,350
hospitals that would teach train their
surgeons and then we said well we're

1388
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:40,360
surgeons and then we said well we're
 

1389
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,230
surgeons and then we said well we're
this at the time we were probably a 12

1390
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:42,240
this at the time we were probably a 12
 

1391
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,950
this at the time we were probably a 12
person company or maybe 15 people I

1392
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:43,960
person company or maybe 15 people I
 

1393
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,710
person company or maybe 15 people I
don't remember uh you there's no way we

1394
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
don't remember uh you there's no way we
 

1395
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,110
don't remember uh you there's no way we
could go after a marketing activity you

1396
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,120
could go after a marketing activity you
 

1397
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,870
could go after a marketing activity you
know the company was all bootstrapped in

1398
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:50,880
know the company was all bootstrapped in
 

1399
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,029
know the company was all bootstrapped in
those years we we never had investors

1400
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
those years we we never had investors
 

1401
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,190
those years we we never had investors
until Google bought us which was after

1402
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
until Google bought us which was after
 

1403
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,549
until Google bought us which was after
20 years so we didn't have any resour

1404
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:57,559
20 years so we didn't have any resour
 

1405
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:00,630
20 years so we didn't have any resour
sources to uh to go after hospitals so

1406
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
sources to uh to go after hospitals so
 

1407
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,190
sources to uh to go after hospitals so
we at one sort of at one day Rob and I

1408
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,200
we at one sort of at one day Rob and I
 

1409
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,630
we at one sort of at one day Rob and I
were looking at that and we said we

1410
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:06,640
were looking at that and we said we
 

1411
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,990
were looking at that and we said we
built another Simulator for knee

1412
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:09,000
built another Simulator for knee
 

1413
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,149
built another Simulator for knee
arthoscopy and we said this isn't going

1414
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:11,159
arthoscopy and we said this isn't going
 

1415
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,630
arthoscopy and we said this isn't going
to work and we killed it and we moved on

1416
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
to work and we killed it and we moved on
 

1417
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,630
to work and we killed it and we moved on
and that was really a milestone in the

1418
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:16,640
and that was really a milestone in the
 

1419
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,870
and that was really a milestone in the
company because we you know we sort of

1420
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
company because we you know we sort of
 

1421
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,149
company because we you know we sort of
understood who we were and uh and what

1422
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:21,159
understood who we were and uh and what
 

1423
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:22,669
understood who we were and uh and what
would work and what wouldn't even though

1424
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:22,679
would work and what wouldn't even though
 

1425
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,389
would work and what wouldn't even though
technically it was really a fascinating

1426
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:24,399
technically it was really a fascinating
 

1427
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,630
technically it was really a fascinating
thing what was that meeting like were

1428
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:26,640
thing what was that meeting like were
 

1429
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,029
thing what was that meeting like were
you just like sit at a table you know

1430
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
you just like sit at a table you know
 

1431
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,470
you just like sit at a table you know
what probably we're going to Pivot

1432
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:31,480
what probably we're going to Pivot
 

1433
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,590
what probably we're going to Pivot
completely we're going to let go of this

1434
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:34,600
completely we're going to let go of this
 

1435
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,430
completely we're going to let go of this
thing we put so much hard work into and

1436
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
thing we put so much hard work into and
 

1437
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,750
thing we put so much hard work into and
then go back to the thing it just always

1438
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:39,760
then go back to the thing it just always
 

1439
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,190
then go back to the thing it just always
felt right once we did it you know just

1440
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:42,200
felt right once we did it you know just
 

1441
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,789
felt right once we did it you know just
look at each other and said let's let's

1442
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:43,799
look at each other and said let's let's
 

1443
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,070
look at each other and said let's let's
build robots yeah what was the first

1444
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,080
build robots yeah what was the first
 

1445
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,110
build robots yeah what was the first
robot you built under the the flag of

1446
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
robot you built under the the flag of
 

1447
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,269
robot you built under the the flag of
Boston Dynamics big dog well there was

1448
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:52,279
Boston Dynamics big dog well there was
 

1449
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,269
Boston Dynamics big dog well there was
the ibow uh runner but it wasn't even a

1450
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
the ibow uh runner but it wasn't even a
 

1451
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,470
the ibow uh runner but it wasn't even a
whole robot it was just legs that we we

1452
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:57,480
whole robot it was just legs that we we
 

1453
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,269
whole robot it was just legs that we we
took off the legs on eyeballs and

1454
00:28:59,269 --> 00:28:59,279
took off the legs on eyeballs and
 

1455
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,789
took off the legs on eyeballs and
attached uh legs we'd made and um you

1456
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:02,799
attached uh legs we'd made and um you
 

1457
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,350
attached uh legs we'd made and um you
know we got that working and showed it

1458
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:04,360
know we got that working and showed it
 

1459
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,110
know we got that working and showed it
to the Sony people uh we worked pretty

1460
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
to the Sony people uh we worked pretty
 

1461
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,230
to the Sony people uh we worked pretty
closely with Sony in those years one of

1462
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:09,240
closely with Sony in those years one of
 

1463
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,750
closely with Sony in those years one of
the interesting things is that uh it was

1464
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
the interesting things is that uh it was
 

1465
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,509
the interesting things is that uh it was
before the internet and zoom and

1466
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:14,519
before the internet and zoom and
 

1467
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,710
before the internet and zoom and
anything like that so we had six ISDN

1468
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:17,720
anything like that so we had six ISDN
 

1469
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,909
anything like that so we had six ISDN
lines installed and we would have a

1470
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
lines installed and we would have a
 

1471
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,750
lines installed and we would have a
telecon every week that worked at very

1472
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:22,760
telecon every week that worked at very
 

1473
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,950
telecon every week that worked at very
low frame rate something like 10 Hertz

1474
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:25,960
low frame rate something like 10 Hertz
 

1475
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,990
low frame rate something like 10 Hertz
uh you know Engish

1476
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
uh you know Engish
 

1477
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,870
uh you know Engish
across the boundary with uh Japan was a

1478
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
across the boundary with uh Japan was a
 

1479
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,350
across the boundary with uh Japan was a
challenge trying to understand what what

1480
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
challenge trying to understand what what
 

1481
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,110
challenge trying to understand what what
each of us was saying and have meetings

1482
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
each of us was saying and have meetings
 

1483
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,029
each of us was saying and have meetings
every week uh for for several years uh

1484
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:38,039
every week uh for for several years uh
 

1485
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,310
every week uh for for several years uh
doing that and uh it was a pleasure

1486
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:41,320
doing that and uh it was a pleasure
 

1487
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,630
doing that and uh it was a pleasure
working with them they were really

1488
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:42,640
working with them they were really
 

1489
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,070
working with them they were really
supporters they they seemed to like us

1490
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:45,080
supporters they they seemed to like us
 

1491
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,190
supporters they they seemed to like us
and what we were doing that was the real

1492
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:47,200
and what we were doing that was the real
 

1493
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,990
and what we were doing that was the real
transition from us being a simulation

1494
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,000
transition from us being a simulation
 

1495
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,190
transition from us being a simulation
company into being a robotics company

1496
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
company into being a robotics company
 

1497
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,590
company into being a robotics company
again it was a quadruped the the legs

1498
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
again it was a quadruped the the legs
 

1499
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,909
again it was a quadruped the the legs
were four legs or two legs four legs

1500
00:29:55,909 --> 00:29:55,919
were four legs or two legs four legs
 

1501
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,590
were four legs or two legs four legs
yeah and what did you learn from that

1502
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,600
yeah and what did you learn from that
 

1503
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,789
yeah and what did you learn from that
experience of uh building a basically a

1504
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
experience of uh building a basically a
 

1505
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,750
experience of uh building a basically a
fast-moving

1506
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:02,760
fast-moving
 

1507
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,070
fast-moving
quadraped mostly we learn that something

1508
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,080
quadraped mostly we learn that something
 

1509
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,070
quadraped mostly we learn that something
that's

1510
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
that's
 

1511
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,669
that's
small uh doesn't look very exciting when

1512
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:08,679
small uh doesn't look very exciting when
 

1513
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:10,509
small uh doesn't look very exciting when
it's running it's like it's scampering

1514
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:10,519
it's running it's like it's scampering
 

1515
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,710
it's running it's like it's scampering
and you had to you had to watch a

1516
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:11,720
and you had to you had to watch a
 

1517
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,950
and you had to you had to watch a
slow-mo for it to look like it was

1518
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:13,960
slow-mo for it to look like it was
 

1519
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,509
slow-mo for it to look like it was
interesting if you watch it fast it was

1520
00:30:16,509 --> 00:30:16,519
interesting if you watch it fast it was
 

1521
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:19,310
interesting if you watch it fast it was
just like a funny one of my things was

1522
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,320
just like a funny one of my things was
 

1523
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,350
just like a funny one of my things was
to show stuff in video even from the

1524
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
to show stuff in video even from the
 

1525
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,990
to show stuff in video even from the
very early days of the hopping machines

1526
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
very early days of the hopping machines
 

1527
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,470
very early days of the hopping machines
um and so I was always focused on how's

1528
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
um and so I was always focused on how's
 

1529
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,310
um and so I was always focused on how's
this going to look through the

1530
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,320
this going to look through the
 

1531
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,990
this going to look through the
viewfinder and uh running eyebow didn't

1532
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,000
viewfinder and uh running eyebow didn't
 

1533
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,509
viewfinder and uh running eyebow didn't
look so cool through the

1534
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:31,519
look so cool through the
 

1535
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,110
look so cool through the
viewfinder so uh what what came next in

1536
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
viewfinder so uh what what came next in
 

1537
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,230
viewfinder so uh what what came next in
terms of uh what was a big next

1538
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:37,240
terms of uh what was a big next
 

1539
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,070
terms of uh what was a big next
milestone in terms of a robot you built

1540
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,080
milestone in terms of a robot you built
 

1541
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,149
milestone in terms of a robot you built
I mean you got to say that big dog was

1542
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:42,159
I mean you got to say that big dog was
 

1543
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,750
I mean you got to say that big dog was
you know sort of put us on the map and

1544
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:44,760
you know sort of put us on the map and
 

1545
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,149
you know sort of put us on the map and
got our heads really pulled together we

1546
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:47,159
got our heads really pulled together we
 

1547
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,590
got our heads really pulled together we
scaled up the company big dog was the

1548
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:49,600
scaled up the company big dog was the
 

1549
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,430
scaled up the company big dog was the
result of uh Allan Rudolph at DARPA uh

1550
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
result of uh Allan Rudolph at DARPA uh
 

1551
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,590
result of uh Allan Rudolph at DARPA uh
starting a biotics program and he put

1552
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:57,600
starting a biotics program and he put
 

1553
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,470
starting a biotics program and he put
out a you know a request for proposals

1554
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:00,480
out a you know a request for proposals
 

1555
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,350
out a you know a request for proposals
and uh I think there were 42 proposals

1556
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:04,360
and uh I think there were 42 proposals
 

1557
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,269
and uh I think there were 42 proposals
written and three got funded one was Big

1558
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
written and three got funded one was Big
 

1559
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,350
written and three got funded one was Big
Dog one was a climbing robot rise and

1560
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:10,360
Dog one was a climbing robot rise and
 

1561
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,269
Dog one was a climbing robot rise and
you know that put things in motion we we

1562
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:12,279
you know that put things in motion we we
 

1563
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,269
you know that put things in motion we we
hired uh Martin buer he was a professor

1564
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:15,279
hired uh Martin buer he was a professor
 

1565
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,669
hired uh Martin buer he was a professor
at M in Montreal at McGill he was uh

1566
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:18,679
at M in Montreal at McGill he was uh
 

1567
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:21,470
at M in Montreal at McGill he was uh
incredibly important for getting big dog

1568
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:21,480
incredibly important for getting big dog
 

1569
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,710
incredibly important for getting big dog
uh out of the lab and into the mud which

1570
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:23,720
uh out of the lab and into the mud which
 

1571
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,029
uh out of the lab and into the mud which
is a you know was a key step to really

1572
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:26,039
is a you know was a key step to really
 

1573
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,669
is a you know was a key step to really
be willing to go out there and uh and

1574
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:28,679
be willing to go out there and uh and
 

1575
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,430
be willing to go out there and uh and
build it break it fix it which is sort

1576
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:30,440
build it break it fix it which is sort
 

1577
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,430
build it break it fix it which is sort
of one of our mots at the company so

1578
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:32,440
of one of our mots at the company so
 

1579
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,350
of one of our mots at the company so
testing it in the real world for people

1580
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:34,360
testing it in the real world for people
 

1581
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,230
testing it in the real world for people
for people who don't know Big Dog maybe

1582
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
for people who don't know Big Dog maybe
 

1583
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,509
for people who don't know Big Dog maybe
you can correct me but it's a it's a big

1584
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:38,519
you can correct me but it's a it's a big
 

1585
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,909
you can correct me but it's a it's a big
quadruped four-leg robot that it looks

1586
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
quadruped four-leg robot that it looks
 

1587
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,430
quadruped four-leg robot that it looks
big could probably carry a lot of weight

1588
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:44,440
big could probably carry a lot of weight
 

1589
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,029
big could probably carry a lot of weight
not the most weight that Boston dyam

1590
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:47,039
not the most weight that Boston dyam
 

1591
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,350
not the most weight that Boston dyam
have built but a lot well it's the first

1592
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:49,360
have built but a lot well it's the first
 

1593
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,990
have built but a lot well it's the first
thing that worked so let's see if we go

1594
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,000
thing that worked so let's see if we go
 

1595
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,549
thing that worked so let's see if we go
back to the leg lab we built a quadruped

1596
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:53,559
back to the leg lab we built a quadruped
 

1597
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:54,830
back to the leg lab we built a quadruped
that could do many of the things that

1598
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:54,840
that could do many of the things that
 

1599
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,190
that could do many of the things that
big dog did but it had uh a hydraulic

1600
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:58,200
big dog did but it had uh a hydraulic
 

1601
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,909
big dog did but it had uh a hydraulic
pump sitting in the room with hoses

1602
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919
pump sitting in the room with hoses
 

1603
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,629
pump sitting in the room with hoses
connected to the robot it had a vax

1604
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:02,639
connected to the robot it had a vax
 

1605
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:04,350
connected to the robot it had a vax
computer in the Next Room it needed its

1606
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:04,360
computer in the Next Room it needed its
 

1607
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,269
computer in the Next Room it needed its
own room because it was this giant thing

1608
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:06,279
own room because it was this giant thing
 

1609
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,149
own room because it was this giant thing
with air conditioning and it had this

1610
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:08,159
with air conditioning and it had this
 

1611
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,070
with air conditioning and it had this
very complicated uh bus connected to the

1612
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:11,080
very complicated uh bus connected to the
 

1613
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,669
very complicated uh bus connected to the
robot and the robot itself just had the

1614
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
robot and the robot itself just had the
 

1615
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,549
robot and the robot itself just had the
actuators it had gyroscopes for sensing

1616
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:16,559
actuators it had gyroscopes for sensing
 

1617
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,269
actuators it had gyroscopes for sensing
and other some other sensors uh but all

1618
00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:19,279
and other some other sensors uh but all
 

1619
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,430
and other some other sensors uh but all
the power and Computing was offboard big

1620
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:22,440
the power and Computing was offboard big
 

1621
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,430
the power and Computing was offboard big
dog had all that stuff integrated uh on

1622
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,440
dog had all that stuff integrated uh on
 

1623
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,909
dog had all that stuff integrated uh on
the platform it had a gas engine for

1624
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:27,919
the platform it had a gas engine for
 

1625
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,350
the platform it had a gas engine for
power which was a very complicated thing

1626
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,360
power which was a very complicated thing
 

1627
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,190
power which was a very complicated thing
to to undertake it had to convert the

1628
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200
to to undertake it had to convert the
 

1629
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,470
to to undertake it had to convert the
rotation of the engine into hydraulic

1630
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:35,480
rotation of the engine into hydraulic
 

1631
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,909
rotation of the engine into hydraulic
power which is how we uh actuated uh it

1632
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:38,919
power which is how we uh actuated uh it
 

1633
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,149
power which is how we uh actuated uh it
so there was a lot of learning just on

1634
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:41,159
so there was a lot of learning just on
 

1635
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,070
so there was a lot of learning just on
the uh you know building the physical

1636
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,080
the uh you know building the physical
 

1637
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,830
the uh you know building the physical
robot and and the system integration for

1638
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:45,840
robot and and the system integration for
 

1639
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,269
robot and and the system integration for
that and then there was the controls uh

1640
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:48,279
that and then there was the controls uh
 

1641
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,629
that and then there was the controls uh
of it so for Big Dog you brought it all

1642
00:32:50,629 --> 00:32:50,639
of it so for Big Dog you brought it all
 

1643
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:53,470
of it so for Big Dog you brought it all
together on one platform right and then

1644
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:53,480
together on one platform right and then
 

1645
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,950
together on one platform right and then
so you could you could you could take it

1646
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:54,960
so you could you could you could take it
 

1647
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,710
so you could you could you could take it
out in the woods yeah and you did we did

1648
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:57,720
out in the woods yeah and you did we did
 

1649
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,070
out in the woods yeah and you did we did
we spent a lot of time down at the uh

1650
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
we spent a lot of time down at the uh
 

1651
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,110
we spent a lot of time down at the uh
Marine Corps Base in quano where there

1652
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,120
Marine Corps Base in quano where there
 

1653
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,669
Marine Corps Base in quano where there
was a trail called The gule Canal Trail

1654
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:05,679
was a trail called The gule Canal Trail
 

1655
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:09,029
was a trail called The gule Canal Trail
and our uh Milestone that DARPA had

1656
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,039
and our uh Milestone that DARPA had
 

1657
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,350
and our uh Milestone that DARPA had
specified was that we could go on this

1658
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,360
specified was that we could go on this
 

1659
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,789
specified was that we could go on this
one particular trail that involved you

1660
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:13,799
one particular trail that involved you
 

1661
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,870
one particular trail that involved you
know a lot of Challenge and we spent a

1662
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:15,880
know a lot of Challenge and we spent a
 

1663
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,070
know a lot of Challenge and we spent a
lot of time our team spent a lot of time

1664
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
lot of time our team spent a lot of time
 

1665
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,830
lot of time our team spent a lot of time
down there those were fun days hiking

1666
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:20,840
down there those were fun days hiking
 

1667
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,750
down there those were fun days hiking
with the robot so what did you learn

1668
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:22,760
with the robot so what did you learn
 

1669
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,310
with the robot so what did you learn
about like what it takes to balance a

1670
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
about like what it takes to balance a
 

1671
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,990
about like what it takes to balance a
robot like that on a trail on a hiking

1672
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,000
robot like that on a trail on a hiking
 

1673
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,350
robot like that on a trail on a hiking
trail in the woods basically forget the

1674
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:30,360
trail in the woods basically forget the
 

1675
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,870
trail in the woods basically forget the
woods just the real world that's the big

1676
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:32,880
woods just the real world that's the big
 

1677
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,269
woods just the real world that's the big
leap into testing in the real world yeah

1678
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:36,279
leap into testing in the real world yeah
 

1679
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:39,470
leap into testing in the real world yeah
as challenging as the woods were working

1680
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:39,480
as challenging as the woods were working
 

1681
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,230
as challenging as the woods were working
inside of a home or in an office is

1682
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,240
inside of a home or in an office is
 

1683
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,350
inside of a home or in an office is
really

1684
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:44,360
really
 

1685
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,310
really
harder yeah because when you're in the

1686
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:46,320
harder yeah because when you're in the
 

1687
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,750
harder yeah because when you're in the
woods you can actually take any path up

1688
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:48,760
woods you can actually take any path up
 

1689
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,350
woods you can actually take any path up
the up the hill all you have to do is

1690
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:50,360
the up the hill all you have to do is
 

1691
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,870
the up the hill all you have to do is
avoid the obstacles you there's no such

1692
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:52,880
avoid the obstacles you there's no such
 

1693
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,149
avoid the obstacles you there's no such
thing as damaging the woods at least you

1694
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:55,159
thing as damaging the woods at least you
 

1695
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,669
thing as damaging the woods at least you
know to first order whereas if you're in

1696
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:57,679
know to first order whereas if you're in
 

1697
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,509
know to first order whereas if you're in
a house you can't leave scuff marks you

1698
00:33:59,509 --> 00:33:59,519
a house you can't leave scuff marks you
 

1699
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,350
a house you can't leave scuff marks you
can't bang into the walls the robots

1700
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
can't bang into the walls the robots
 

1701
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,750
can't bang into the walls the robots
aren't very comfortable bumping into the

1702
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:02,760
aren't very comfortable bumping into the
 

1703
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,549
aren't very comfortable bumping into the
walls especially in the early days so I

1704
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:05,559
walls especially in the early days so I
 

1705
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,389
walls especially in the early days so I
think those were actually bigger

1706
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:07,399
think those were actually bigger
 

1707
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:10,349
think those were actually bigger
challenges once once we fa them uh it

1708
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:10,359
challenges once once we fa them uh it
 

1709
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:12,950
challenges once once we fa them uh it
was mostly you know getting the systems

1710
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
was mostly you know getting the systems
 

1711
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,470
was mostly you know getting the systems
uh to work well enough together the the

1712
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:15,480
uh to work well enough together the the
 

1713
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,470
uh to work well enough together the the
hardware systems to work and and the

1714
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:17,480
hardware systems to work and and the
 

1715
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,669
hardware systems to work and and the
controls in those days we did have a

1716
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
controls in those days we did have a
 

1717
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,430
controls in those days we did have a
human operator who did all the visual

1718
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:22,440
human operator who did all the visual
 

1719
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,829
human operator who did all the visual
perception uh going up the guad Canal

1720
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:24,839
perception uh going up the guad Canal
 

1721
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:26,710
perception uh going up the guad Canal
Trail so you there was an operator who

1722
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:26,720
Trail so you there was an operator who
 

1723
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,710
Trail so you there was an operator who
was right there who was very skilled at

1724
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:29,720
was right there who was very skilled at
 

1725
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,230
was right there who was very skilled at
even though the robot was balancing

1726
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,240
even though the robot was balancing
 

1727
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,750
even though the robot was balancing
itself and placing its own feet uh if

1728
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:33,760
itself and placing its own feet uh if
 

1729
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,389
itself and placing its own feet uh if
the operator didn't do the right thing

1730
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:35,399
the operator didn't do the right thing
 

1731
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,430
the operator didn't do the right thing
it wouldn't go but years later we went

1732
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:37,440
it wouldn't go but years later we went
 

1733
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,550
it wouldn't go but years later we went
back with one of the electric the pre

1734
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:39,560
back with one of the electric the pre
 

1735
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,750
back with one of the electric the pre
precursor to spot and uh we had Advanced

1736
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:42,760
precursor to spot and uh we had Advanced
 

1737
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,230
precursor to spot and uh we had Advanced
the controls and everything so much that

1738
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,240
the controls and everything so much that
 

1739
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,909
the controls and everything so much that
uh an amateur complete amateur could

1740
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:47,919
uh an amateur complete amateur could
 

1741
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,589
uh an amateur complete amateur could
operate the robot the first time up and

1742
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:50,599
operate the robot the first time up and
 

1743
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,909
operate the robot the first time up and
down and up and down whereas it taken us

1744
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:52,919
down and up and down whereas it taken us
 

1745
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,990
down and up and down whereas it taken us
years to to get there in the previous

1746
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,000
years to to get there in the previous
 

1747
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,710
years to to get there in the previous
robot so if you fast forward big dog

1748
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:57,720
robot so if you fast forward big dog
 

1749
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,550
robot so if you fast forward big dog
eventually became spot so big dog became

1750
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
eventually became spot so big dog became
 

1751
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,109
eventually became spot so big dog became
LS3 which is the big load carrying one

1752
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:03,119
LS3 which is the big load carrying one
 

1753
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,550
LS3 which is the big load carrying one
just just a quick pause it can carry 400

1754
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:06,560
just just a quick pause it can carry 400
 

1755
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,270
just just a quick pause it can carry 400
lb it was designed to carry 400 but we

1756
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,280
lb it was designed to carry 400 but we
 

1757
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,109
lb it was designed to carry 400 but we
had it carrying about a th000 pounds one

1758
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:12,119
had it carrying about a th000 pounds one
 

1759
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,990
had it carrying about a th000 pounds one
of course you did just we had one

1760
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,000
of course you did just we had one
 

1761
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,390
of course you did just we had one
carrying the other one we had two of

1762
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
carrying the other one we had two of
 

1763
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,030
carrying the other one we had two of
them so we had one carrying the other

1764
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,040
them so we had one carrying the other
 

1765
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,349
them so we had one carrying the other
one there's a little clip of that we

1766
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:19,359
one there's a little clip of that we
 

1767
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,030
one there's a little clip of that we
should put that out somewhere that's

1768
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,040
should put that out somewhere that's
 

1769
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,470
should put that out somewhere that's
from like 20 years ago but wow wow and

1770
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:24,480
from like 20 years ago but wow wow and
 

1771
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,270
from like 20 years ago but wow wow and
it it can go for very long distances you

1772
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:26,280
it it can go for very long distances you
 

1773
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,390
it it can go for very long distances you
can travel 20 mies yeah uh gasoline

1774
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,400
can travel 20 mies yeah uh gasoline
 

1775
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,190
can travel 20 mies yeah uh gasoline
gasoline yeah and that that event just

1776
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
gasoline yeah and that that event just
 

1777
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,430
gasoline yeah and that that event just
okay sorry so LS3 then what uh how did

1778
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:36,440
okay sorry so LS3 then what uh how did
 

1779
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,069
okay sorry so LS3 then what uh how did
that lead to spot so big dog and LS3 had

1780
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:42,079
that lead to spot so big dog and LS3 had
 

1781
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,750
that lead to spot so big dog and LS3 had
uh engine power and hydraulic

1782
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,760
uh engine power and hydraulic
 

1783
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,950
uh engine power and hydraulic
actuation then we made uh a robot that

1784
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:49,960
actuation then we made uh a robot that
 

1785
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,589
actuation then we made uh a robot that
was electric uh Power so there's a

1786
00:35:53,589 --> 00:35:53,599
was electric uh Power so there's a
 

1787
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,870
was electric uh Power so there's a
battery driving a motor driving a pump

1788
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:56,880
battery driving a motor driving a pump
 

1789
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,670
battery driving a motor driving a pump
but still hydraulic actuation yeah Larry

1790
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
but still hydraulic actuation yeah Larry
 

1791
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,910
but still hydraulic actuation yeah Larry
sort of asked us could you make

1792
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:00,920
sort of asked us could you make
 

1793
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,510
sort of asked us could you make
something that weighed 60 pounds that

1794
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:02,520
something that weighed 60 pounds that
 

1795
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,829
something that weighed 60 pounds that
would not be so intimidating if you had

1796
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:04,839
would not be so intimidating if you had
 

1797
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:07,150
would not be so intimidating if you had
it in a house uh where there were people

1798
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:07,160
it in a house uh where there were people
 

1799
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,390
it in a house uh where there were people
and that was the inspiration behind uh

1800
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:09,400
and that was the inspiration behind uh
 

1801
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,230
and that was the inspiration behind uh
the spot pretty much as it exists today

1802
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:11,240
the spot pretty much as it exists today
 

1803
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,470
the spot pretty much as it exists today
we did a prototype the same size that

1804
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:13,480
we did a prototype the same size that
 

1805
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,550
we did a prototype the same size that
was the first all El electric um nonel

1806
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:17,560
was the first all El electric um nonel
 

1807
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,470
was the first all El electric um nonel
non-hydraulic robot what was the

1808
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:19,480
non-hydraulic robot what was the
 

1809
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,870
non-hydraulic robot what was the
conversation with Larry paage like about

1810
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:21,880
conversation with Larry paage like about
 

1811
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,790
conversation with Larry paage like about
so here's a guy that kind of is very

1812
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:24,800
so here's a guy that kind of is very
 

1813
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,390
so here's a guy that kind of is very
product focused and can can see a for

1814
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:27,400
product focused and can can see a for
 

1815
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,190
product focused and can can see a for
like what the future holds that's just

1816
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,200
like what the future holds that's just
 

1817
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,950
like what the future holds that's just
interesting kind of aside what was the

1818
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:31,960
interesting kind of aside what was the
 

1819
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,109
interesting kind of aside what was the
brainstorm about the future robotics

1820
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:34,119
brainstorm about the future robotics
 

1821
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,390
brainstorm about the future robotics
with him like I mean it was almost as

1822
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400
with him like I mean it was almost as
 

1823
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,230
with him like I mean it was almost as
simple as what I just said he you know

1824
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,240
simple as what I just said he you know
 

1825
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,069
simple as what I just said he you know
we having meeting he said yeah gez you

1826
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:41,079
we having meeting he said yeah gez you
 

1827
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,109
we having meeting he said yeah gez you
know do you think you could make a

1828
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:42,119
know do you think you could make a
 

1829
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,430
know do you think you could make a
smaller one that wouldn't be so

1830
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:43,440
smaller one that wouldn't be so
 

1831
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,790
smaller one that wouldn't be so
intimidating you like a big dog yeah uh

1832
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:46,800
intimidating you like a big dog yeah uh
 

1833
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,150
intimidating you like a big dog yeah uh
if it was in your house and I said yeah

1834
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,160
if it was in your house and I said yeah
 

1835
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,030
if it was in your house and I said yeah
we could do that and we started and and

1836
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,040
we could do that and we started and and
 

1837
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,550
we could do that and we started and and
did is there a lot of technical

1838
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:53,560
did is there a lot of technical
 

1839
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,790
did is there a lot of technical
challenges to go from hydraulic to

1840
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:55,800
challenges to go from hydraulic to
 

1841
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,270
challenges to go from hydraulic to
Electric you know I had been in love

1842
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:58,280
Electric you know I had been in love
 

1843
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,710
Electric you know I had been in love
with hydraulics and still uh love

1844
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
with hydraulics and still uh love
 

1845
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,109
with hydraulics and still uh love
Hydraulics uh you know it's it's a great

1846
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:03,119
Hydraulics uh you know it's it's a great
 

1847
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,589
Hydraulics uh you know it's it's a great
technology it's too bad that the somehow

1848
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
technology it's too bad that the somehow
 

1849
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,470
technology it's too bad that the somehow
the the world out there looks at it like

1850
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:08,480
the the world out there looks at it like
 

1851
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,470
the the world out there looks at it like
it's oldfashioned or that it's um icky

1852
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
it's oldfashioned or that it's um icky
 

1853
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,230
it's oldfashioned or that it's um icky
and it's true that you do it is very

1854
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
and it's true that you do it is very
 

1855
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,910
and it's true that you do it is very
hard to keep it from having some amount

1856
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
hard to keep it from having some amount
 

1857
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,030
hard to keep it from having some amount
of dripping from time to time uh but if

1858
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,040
of dripping from time to time uh but if
 

1859
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,309
of dripping from time to time uh but if
you look at the performance uh you know

1860
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:21,319
you look at the performance uh you know
 

1861
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:23,550
you look at the performance uh you know
how strong you can get in a lightweight

1862
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:23,560
how strong you can get in a lightweight
 

1863
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,630
how strong you can get in a lightweight
package and of course we did a huge

1864
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:25,640
package and of course we did a huge
 

1865
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,630
package and of course we did a huge
amount of innovation most of hydraulic

1866
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
amount of innovation most of hydraulic
 

1867
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,710
amount of innovation most of hydraulic
uh control that is the valve that

1868
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:30,720
uh control that is the valve that
 

1869
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,990
uh control that is the valve that
controls the flow of oil had been

1870
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,000
controls the flow of oil had been
 

1871
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,470
controls the flow of oil had been
designed in the ' 50s for airplanes it

00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:36,480
designed in the ' 50s for airplanes it
 

1873
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,790
designed in the ' 50s for airplanes it
had been made robust enough safe enough

00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:39,800
had been made robust enough safe enough
 

1875
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,150
had been made robust enough safe enough
that you could count on it so that

1876
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,160
that you could count on it so that
 

1877
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,270
that you could count on it so that
humans could fly in airplanes and very

1878
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:45,280
humans could fly in airplanes and very
 

1879
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,670

little Innovation had happened you know

1880
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:47,680
little Innovation had happened you know
 

1881
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,030
little Innovation had happened you know
that might not be fair to the people who

1882
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:49,040
that might not be fair to the people who
 

1883
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,230
that might not be fair to the people who
make the valves I'm sure that they did

1884
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:51,240
make the valves I'm sure that they did
 

1885
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,829
make the valves I'm sure that they did
innovate but the basic design had stayed

1886
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:53,839
innovate but the basic design had stayed
 

1887
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,230
innovate but the basic design had stayed
the same and there was so much more you

1888
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,240
the same and there was so much more you
 

1889
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,230
the same and there was so much more you
could do and so our Engineers designed

1890
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,240
could do and so our Engineers designed
 

1891
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,550
could do and so our Engineers designed
valves uh the ones that are in uh in

efficient use they were much smaller and

1900
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:10,319
efficient use they were much smaller and
 

1901
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:11,990
efficient use they were much smaller and
lighter so the whole robot could be

1902
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000
lighter so the whole robot could be
 

1903
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,430
lighter so the whole robot could be
smaller and lighter uh we made a

1904
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:14,440
smaller and lighter uh we made a
 

1905
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,630
smaller and lighter uh we made a

Boston Dynamics have created is how

1930
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
Boston Dynamics have created is how
 

1931
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,829
Boston Dynamics have created is how
beautiful the movement is how natural

1932

flipping with throwing is so maybe you

1936
00:38:58,309 --> 00:38:58,319
flipping with throwing is so maybe you
 

1937
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:00,790
flipping with throwing is so maybe you
can talk about what what's involved in

1938
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:00,800
can talk about what what's involved in
 

1939
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,470
can talk about what what's involved in
making it look natural well I think

1940
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:03,480
making it look natural well I think
 

1941
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,790
making it look natural well I think
having good Hardware is part of the

1942
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:05,800
having good Hardware is part of the
 

1943
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,750
having good Hardware is part of the
story and people who think you don't

1944
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:07,760
story and people who think you don't
 

1945
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,510
story and people who think you don't
need to innovate Hardware anymore are

1946
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:10,520
need to innovate Hardware anymore are
 

1947
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,990
need to innovate Hardware anymore are
wrong in my opinion um so I think one of

1948
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,000
wrong in my opinion um so I think one of
 

1949
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,470
wrong in my opinion um so I think one of
the things certainly in the early years

1950
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:15,480
the things certainly in the early years
 

1951
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,150
the things certainly in the early years
for me taking a dynamic approach where

1952
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
for me taking a dynamic approach where
 

1953
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,349
for me taking a dynamic approach where
you think about what's the evolution of

1954
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:21,359
you think about what's the evolution of
 

1955
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,030
you think about what's the evolution of
the motion of the thing going to be uh

1956
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,040
the motion of the thing going to be uh
 

1957
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,270
the motion of the thing going to be uh
in the future and having a prediction of

1958
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:26,280
in the future and having a prediction of
 

1959
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,630
in the future and having a prediction of
that that's used at the time that you're

1960
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:28,640
that that's used at the time that you're
 

1961
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,950
that that's used at the time that you're
giving signals to it as opposed to it

1962
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:30,960
giving signals to it as opposed to it
 

1963
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,750
giving signals to it as opposed to it
all being serving which is servoing is

1964
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:32,760
all being serving which is servoing is
 

1965
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,589
all being serving which is servoing is
sort of backward looking it says okay

1966
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:34,599
sort of backward looking it says okay
 

1967
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,990
sort of backward looking it says okay
where am I now I'm gonna I'm G to try

1968
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,000
where am I now I'm gonna I'm G to try
 

1969
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,390
where am I now I'm gonna I'm G to try
and adjust for that but you really need

1970
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,400
and adjust for that but you really need
 

1971
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,990
and adjust for that but you really need
to think about what's coming so how far

1972
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,000
to think about what's coming so how far
 

1973
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,790
to think about what's coming so how far
ahead do you do you have to look in time

1974
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:43,800
ahead do you do you have to look in time
 

1975
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,150
ahead do you do you have to look in time
uh it's interesting I think that the

1976
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,160
uh it's interesting I think that the
 

1977
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,910
uh it's interesting I think that the
number is only a couple of seconds for

1978
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
number is only a couple of seconds for
 

1979
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,950
number is only a couple of seconds for
spot so there's a limited Horizon uh

1980
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:51,960
spot so there's a limited Horizon uh
 

1981
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,790
spot so there's a limited Horizon uh
type approach where you're recalculating

1982
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:54,800
type approach where you're recalculating
 

1983
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,630
type approach where you're recalculating
assuming what's going to happen in the

1984
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:56,640
assuming what's going to happen in the
 

1985
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,390
assuming what's going to happen in the
next a second or second and a half and

1986
00:39:59,390 --> 00:39:59,400
next a second or second and a half and
 

1987
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,230
next a second or second and a half and
then you keep iterating you know at the

1988
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,240
then you keep iterating you know at the
 

1989
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,030
then you keep iterating you know at the
next even though a tenth of a second

1990
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:03,040
next even though a tenth of a second
 

1991
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,950
next even though a tenth of a second
later you'll say okay let's do that

1992
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:04,960
later you'll say okay let's do that
 

1993
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,510
later you'll say okay let's do that
again and see what's happening and

1994
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:06,520
again and see what's happening and
 

1995
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,190
again and see what's happening and
you're looking at what the obstacles are

1996
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,200
you're looking at what the obstacles are
 

1997
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,109
you're looking at what the obstacles are
where the feet are going to be placed

1998
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:10,119
where the feet are going to be placed
 

1999
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,990
where the feet are going to be placed
how to you know you have to coordinate a

2000
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,000
how to you know you have to coordinate a
 

2001
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,190
how to you know you have to coordinate a
lot of things if you have obstacles and

2002
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,200
lot of things if you have obstacles and
 

2003
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,470
lot of things if you have obstacles and
you're balancing at the same time and

2004
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
you're balancing at the same time and
 

2005
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,589
you're balancing at the same time and
it's that uh limited Horizon type

2006
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:18,599
it's that uh limited Horizon type
 

2007
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,870
it's that uh limited Horizon type
calculation that's doing a lot of that

2008
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:20,880
calculation that's doing a lot of that
 

2009
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,190
calculation that's doing a lot of that
but if you're doing something like a

2010
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,200
but if you're doing something like a
 

2011
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,309
but if you're doing something like a
somersault you're looking out a lot

2012
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319
somersault you're looking out a lot
 

2013
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,910
somersault you're looking out a lot
further right if you want to stick the

2014
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:25,920
further right if you want to stick the
 

2015
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,589
further right if you want to stick the
landing you have to get the you you have

2016
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:28,599
landing you have to get the you you have
 

2017
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,550
landing you have to get the you you have
to at the time of launch have uh you

2018
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:31,560
to at the time of launch have uh you
 

2019
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,990
to at the time of launch have uh you
know momentum and uh rotation all those

2020
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,000
know momentum and uh rotation all those
 

2021
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,910
know momentum and uh rotation all those
things coordinated so that a landing is

2022
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:36,920
things coordinated so that a landing is
 

2023
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,470
things coordinated so that a landing is
Within Reach how hard is it to stick a

2024
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:39,480
Within Reach how hard is it to stick a
 

2025
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:43,109
Within Reach how hard is it to stick a
landing I mean it's very much undere

2026
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:43,119
landing I mean it's very much undere
 

2027
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:47,309
landing I mean it's very much undere
actuated like you once you've in the air

2028
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:47,319
actuated like you once you've in the air
 

2029
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,270
actuated like you once you've in the air
you don't have as much control about

2030
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,280
you don't have as much control about
 

2031
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,349
you don't have as much control about
anything so how hard is it to get that

2032
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:53,359
anything so how hard is it to get that
 

2033
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,390
anything so how hard is it to get that
to work you first of all did flips with

2034
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:55,400
to work you first of all did flips with
 

2035
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,510
to work you first of all did flips with
a Hopping robot

2036
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:57,520
a Hopping robot
 

2037
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,109
a Hopping robot
if you look at the first time we ever

2038
00:40:59,109 --> 00:40:59,119
if you look at the first time we ever
 

2039
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,630
if you look at the first time we ever
made a robot do a somersault it was in a

2040
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:01,640
made a robot do a somersault it was in a
 

2041
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,150
made a robot do a somersault it was in a
planer robot you know it had a boom uh

2042
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:05,160
planer robot you know it had a boom uh
 

2043
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,670
planer robot you know it had a boom uh
so it could only it was restricted to

2044
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:06,680
so it could only it was restricted to
 

2045
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,270
so it could only it was restricted to
the surface of a sphere we call that

2046
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:08,280
the surface of a sphere we call that
 

2047
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,550
the surface of a sphere we call that
planer so it could move for and a it

2048
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
planer so it could move for and a it
 

2049
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,790
planer so it could move for and a it
could go up and down and it could rotate

2050
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:12,800
could go up and down and it could rotate
 

2051
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,470
could go up and down and it could rotate
and so the calculation of what you need

2052
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:14,480
and so the calculation of what you need
 

2053
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,870
and so the calculation of what you need
to do to get a to stick a landing isn't

2054
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
to do to get a to stick a landing isn't
 

2055
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,910
to do to get a to stick a landing isn't
all that complicated you have to look at

2056
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
all that complicated you have to look at
 

2057
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,990
all that complicated you have to look at
you know you have to get time to make

2058
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
you know you have to get time to make
 

2059
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,069
you know you have to get time to make
the rotation so how hard you jump how

2060
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
the rotation so how hard you jump how
 

2061
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,510
the rotation so how hard you jump how
high you jump gives you time uh you look

2062
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,520
high you jump gives you time uh you look
 

2063
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,430
high you jump gives you time uh you look
at how quickly you can rotate and so you

2064
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:30,440
at how quickly you can rotate and so you
 

2065
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,390
at how quickly you can rotate and so you
know if you get those two right then

2066
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,400
know if you get those two right then
 

2067
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,030
know if you get those two right then
when you land you have the feet in the

2068
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:34,040
when you land you have the feet in the
 

2069
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,870
when you land you have the feet in the
right place and you have to get rid of

2070
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:35,880
right place and you have to get rid of
 

2071
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,670
right place and you have to get rid of
all that rotational and uh linear

2072
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:38,680
all that rotational and uh linear
 

2073
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,390
all that rotational and uh linear
momentum but you know that's not too

2074
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:41,400
momentum but you know that's not too
 

2075
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,390
momentum but you know that's not too
hard to figure out and we made you know

2076
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:43,400
hard to figure out and we made you know
 

2077
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,550
hard to figure out and we made you know
back in uh about 1985 or six I can't

2078
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
back in uh about 1985 or six I can't
 

2079
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,309
back in uh about 1985 or six I can't
remember we had a simple robot doing

2080
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:49,319
remember we had a simple robot doing
 

2081
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:52,270
remember we had a simple robot doing
somersaults to do it in 3D really the

2082
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:52,280
somersaults to do it in 3D really the
 

2083
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,870
somersaults to do it in 3D really the
calculation is the same you just have to

2084
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:53,880
calculation is the same you just have to
 

2085
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,430
calculation is the same you just have to
be balancing in the other degrees of

2086
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
be balancing in the other degrees of
 

2087
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,109
be balancing in the other degrees of
freedom if you just doing a somersault

2088
00:41:57,109 --> 00:41:57,119
freedom if you just doing a somersault
 

2089
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,150
freedom if you just doing a somersault
it's just a a planer thing R Rob was my

2090
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,160
it's just a a planer thing R Rob was my
 

2091
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,910
it's just a a planer thing R Rob was my
graduate student and we were at MIT

2092
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:01,920
graduate student and we were at MIT
 

2093
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,750
graduate student and we were at MIT
which is when we made you know a

2094
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
which is when we made you know a
 

2095
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,910
which is when we made you know a
two-legged robot do a 3D somersault for

2096
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:05,920
two-legged robot do a 3D somersault for
 

2097
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,510
two-legged robot do a 3D somersault for
the first time um there we in order to

2098
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:09,520
the first time um there we in order to
 

2099
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,109
the first time um there we in order to
get enough rotation rate you needed to

2100
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:11,119
get enough rotation rate you needed to
 

2101
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,230
get enough rotation rate you needed to
do tucking also uh you know withdraw the

2102
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,240
do tucking also uh you know withdraw the
 

2103
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,510
do tucking also uh you know withdraw the
legs in order to accelerate it and he

2104
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:16,520
legs in order to accelerate it and he
 

2105
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,950
legs in order to accelerate it and he
did some really fascinating work on on

2106
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:18,960
did some really fascinating work on on
 

2107
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,710
did some really fascinating work on on
how you stabilize more complicated

2108
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:20,720
how you stabilize more complicated
 

2109
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,069
how you stabilize more complicated
Maneuvers remember he was a gymnast a

2110
00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:23,079
Maneuvers remember he was a gymnast a
 

2111
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:25,470
Maneuvers remember he was a gymnast a
champion gymnast before he'd come to me

2112
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:25,480
champion gymnast before he'd come to me
 

2113
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,510
champion gymnast before he'd come to me
so he had he had the physical abilities

2114
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:28,520
so he had he had the physical abilities
 

2115
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,630
so he had he had the physical abilities
and he was a you know an engineer so he

2116
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:30,640
and he was a you know an engineer so he
 

2117
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,069
and he was a you know an engineer so he
could translate some of that into the

2118
00:42:33,069 --> 00:42:33,079
could translate some of that into the
 

2119
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:36,230
could translate some of that into the
math and the algorithms that you need to

2120
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:36,240
math and the algorithms that you need to
 

2121
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,630
math and the algorithms that you need to
to do that he knew how humans do it he

2122
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:38,640
to do that he knew how humans do it he
 

2123
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,109
to do that he knew how humans do it he
just had to get robots to do the same

2124
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
just had to get robots to do the same
 

2125
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,910
just had to get robots to do the same
unfortunately though when you humans

2126
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:42,920
unfortunately though when you humans
 

2127
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,030
unfortunately though when you humans
don't really know how they do it yeah

2128
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,040
don't really know how they do it yeah
 

2129
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,270
don't really know how they do it yeah
right we we're coached we we have ways

2130
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:48,280
right we we're coached we we have ways
 

2131
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,710
right we we're coached we we have ways
of learning but do we really understand

2132
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
of learning but do we really understand
 

2133
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,270
of learning but do we really understand
in a physical in a physics way uh what

2134
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
in a physical in a physics way uh what
 

2135
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,430
in a physical in a physics way uh what
we're doing probably most gymnast and

2136
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:56,440
we're doing probably most gymnast and
 

2137
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,069
we're doing probably most gymnast and
athletes don't know so in some way by

2138
00:42:59,069 --> 00:42:59,079
athletes don't know so in some way by
 

2139
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,990
athletes don't know so in some way by
building robots you are in part

2140
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,000
building robots you are in part
 

2141
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,390
building robots you are in part
understanding how humans do like walking

2142
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:04,400
understanding how humans do like walking
 

2143
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,549
understanding how humans do like walking
most of us walk without considering how

2144
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:06,559
most of us walk without considering how
 

2145
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,069
most of us walk without considering how
we walk really right and how we make it

2146
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:09,079
we walk really right and how we make it
 

2147
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:10,670
we walk really right and how we make it
so natural and efficient all those kinds

2148
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:10,680
so natural and efficient all those kinds
 

2149
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,510
so natural and efficient all those kinds
of things at still doesn't walk like a

2150
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:12,520
of things at still doesn't walk like a
 

2151
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,270
of things at still doesn't walk like a
person and it still doesn't walk quite

2152
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:14,280
person and it still doesn't walk quite
 

2153
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,349
person and it still doesn't walk quite
as gracefully as a person even though

2154
00:43:16,349 --> 00:43:16,359
as gracefully as a person even though
 

2155
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:18,510
as gracefully as a person even though
it's been getting closer and closer the

2156
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:18,520
it's been getting closer and closer the
 

2157
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,309
it's been getting closer and closer the
running might be close to a human but

2158
00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:21,319
running might be close to a human but
 

2159
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:23,710
running might be close to a human but
the Walking is Still a challenge that's

2160
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:23,720
the Walking is Still a challenge that's
 

2161
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,670
the Walking is Still a challenge that's
interesting right that running is closer

2162
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:25,680
interesting right that running is closer
 

2163
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,750
interesting right that running is closer
to a human

2164
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:26,760
to a human
 

2165
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,470
to a human
it just shows that the more aggressive

2166
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:29,480
it just shows that the more aggressive
 

2167
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,309
it just shows that the more aggressive
and kind of the more you leap into the

2168
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:33,319
and kind of the more you leap into the
 

2169
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,230
and kind of the more you leap into the
unknown the more natural it is I mean

2170
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:35,240
unknown the more natural it is I mean
 

2171
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,589
unknown the more natural it is I mean
walking is kind of falling always right

2172
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:37,599
walking is kind of falling always right
 

2173
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,750
walking is kind of falling always right
and something weird about the knee that

2174
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:39,760
and something weird about the knee that
 

2175
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,109
and something weird about the knee that
you can kind of do this folding and

2176
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:42,119
you can kind of do this folding and
 

2177
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,670
you can kind of do this folding and
unfolding and get it to work out just a

2178
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:44,680
unfolding and get it to work out just a
 

2179
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,349
unfolding and get it to work out just a
human can get it to work out just right

2180
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:46,359
human can get it to work out just right
 

2181
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:48,790
human can get it to work out just right
there's compliances compliance means

2182
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:48,800
there's compliances compliance means
 

2183
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,589
there's compliances compliance means

quadruped probably of course it was

2210
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
quadruped probably of course it was
 

2211
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,829
quadruped probably of course it was
probably the loudest too so we had this

2212
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
probably the loudest too so we had this
 

2213
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,270
probably the loudest too so we had this

the leg lab I believe most of the robots

2222
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:34,880
the leg lab I believe most of the robots
 

2223
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,150
the leg lab I believe most of the robots
didn't have

didn't have
 

2225
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,829
didn't have
knees how what's the how do you figure

2226
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:39,839
knees how what's the how do you figure
 

2227
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,309
knees how what's the how do you figure
out what is the right number of

2228
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:41,319
out what is the right number of
 

2229
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:43,190
out what is the right number of
actuators what what are the joints to

2230
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,200
actuators what what are the joints to
 

2231
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,750
actuators what what are the joints to
have what do you need to have uh you

2232
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
have what do you need to have uh you
 

2233
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,230
have what do you need to have uh you
know we humans have knees and all kinds

2234
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:49,240
know we humans have knees and all kinds
 

2235
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,589
know we humans have knees and all kinds
of interesting stuff on the feet the toe

2236
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
of interesting stuff on the feet the toe
 

2237
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,190
of interesting stuff on the feet the toe
is an important part I guess for humans

2238
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:54,200
is an important part I guess for humans
 

2239
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,349
is an important part I guess for humans
or maybe it's not I inured my my toe

2240
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:56,359
or maybe it's not I inured my my toe
 

2241
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:58,109
or maybe it's not I inured my my toe
recently and it made running very

2242
00:44:58,109 --> 00:44:58,119
recently and it made running very
 

2243
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,270
recently and it made running very
unpleasant so that seems to be kind of

2244
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:00,280
unpleasant so that seems to be kind of
 

2245
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,230
unpleasant so that seems to be kind of
important so how do you figure out for

2246
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,240
important so how do you figure out for
 

2247
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,990
important so how do you figure out for

2317
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,750
no most of it's up in the feathers but
there's a huge amount going on in the

2318
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:36,760
there's a huge amount going on in the
 

2319
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,030
there's a huge amount going on in the
feathers including a knee joint the knee

2320
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:39,040
feathers including a knee joint the knee
 

2321
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,670
feathers including a knee joint the knee
joint's way up there the thing that's

2322
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:40,680
joint's way up there the thing that's
 

2323
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,510
joint's way up there the thing that's
halfway down the leg that looks like a

2324
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:43,520
halfway down the leg that looks like a
 

2325
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,589
halfway down the leg that looks like a
backwards knee is actually the ankle the

2326
00:46:46,589 --> 00:46:46,599
backwards knee is actually the ankle the
 

2327
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:48,670
backwards knee is actually the ankle the
thing on the ground which looks like the

2328
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:48,680
thing on the ground which looks like the
 

2329
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,549
thing on the ground which looks like the
foot is actually the toes it's an

2330
00:46:50,549 --> 00:46:50,559
foot is actually the toes it's an
 

2331
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:53,270
foot is actually the toes it's an
extended toe fascinating but you know

2332
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
extended toe fascinating but you know
 

2333
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,910
extended toe fascinating but you know
the basic morphology is in is the same

2334
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:55,920
the basic morphology is in is the same
 

2335
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,150
the basic morphology is in is the same
in in uh all these animals what do you

2336
00:46:59,150 --> 00:46:59,160
in in uh all these animals what do you
 

2337
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,750
in in uh all these animals what do you
think is the the most beautiful movement

2338
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:02,760
think is the the most beautiful movement
 

2339
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,069
think is the the most beautiful movement
of an animal like what animal you think

2340
00:47:05,069 --> 00:47:05,079
of an animal like what animal you think
 

2341
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:07,670
of an animal like what animal you think
is the coolest land animal let's gool

2342
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
is the coolest land animal let's gool
 

2343
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,150
is the coolest land animal let's gool
cuz fish is pretty cool like the way

2344
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:09,160
cuz fish is pretty cool like the way
 

2345
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,950
cuz fish is pretty cool like the way
fish goes to water but like legged

2346
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:10,960
fish goes to water but like legged
 

2347
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,910
fish goes to water but like legged
Locomotion you know the slow MOS of

2348
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:12,920
Locomotion you know the slow MOS of
 

2349
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,030
Locomotion you know the slow MOS of
cheetah's running are are incredible you

2350
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
cheetah's running are are incredible you
 

2351
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,270
cheetah's running are are incredible you
know they're they there's so much back

2352
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
know they're they there's so much back
 

2353
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,069
know they're they there's so much back
motion and uh you know Grace and they of

2354
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:21,079
motion and uh you know Grace and they of
 

2355
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:24,109
motion and uh you know Grace and they of
course they're moving very fast uh the

2356
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:24,119
course they're moving very fast uh the
 

2357
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:25,829
course they're moving very fast uh the
animals running away from the cheetah

2358
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
animals running away from the cheetah
 

2359
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,069
animals running away from the cheetah
pretty exciting you know the prong Horn

2360
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:28,079
pretty exciting you know the prong Horn
 

2361
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,829
pretty exciting you know the prong Horn
uh which you know they they do this all

2362
00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:30,839
uh which you know they they do this all
 

2363
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:33,430
uh which you know they they do this all
four legs at once jump called the prong

2364
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:33,440
four legs at once jump called the prong
 

2365
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,990
four legs at once jump called the prong
to kind of confuse the especially if

2366
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,000
to kind of confuse the especially if
 

2367
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,750
to kind of confuse the especially if
there's a group of them to confuse

2368
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:37,760
there's a group of them to confuse
 

2369
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,790
there's a group of them to confuse
whoever's chasing them so they do like a

2370
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:39,800
whoever's chasing them so they do like a
 

2371
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,549
whoever's chasing them so they do like a
misdirection type of thing yep they do

2372
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:41,559
misdirection type of thing yep they do
 

2373
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,750
misdirection type of thing yep they do
MISD Direction thing the Fronton views

2374
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
MISD Direction thing the Fronton views
 

2375
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,349
MISD Direction thing the Fronton views
of the cheetah is running fast where the

2376
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
of the cheetah is running fast where the
 

2377
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,750
of the cheetah is running fast where the
tail is whipping around to help in the

2378
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:47,760
tail is whipping around to help in the
 

2379
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,270
tail is whipping around to help in the
turns to help us stabilize in the turns

2380
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:50,280
turns to help us stabilize in the turns
 

2381
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,750
turns to help us stabilize in the turns
so that's pretty exciting cuz they spend

2382
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:51,760
so that's pretty exciting cuz they spend
 

2383
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,549
so that's pretty exciting cuz they spend
a lot of time in the air I guess as

2384
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:53,559
a lot of time in the air I guess as
 

2385
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:55,390
a lot of time in the air I guess as
they're running that fast but they also

2386
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:55,400
they're running that fast but they also
 

2387
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,950
they're running that fast but they also
turn very fast is that a tail thing or

2388
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:57,960
turn very fast is that a tail thing or
 

2389
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,710
turn very fast is that a tail thing or
is that do you have to have contact with

2390
00:47:59,710 --> 00:47:59,720
is that do you have to have contact with
 

2391
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,549
is that do you have to have contact with
the ground oh everything in the body is

2392
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:01,559
the ground oh everything in the body is
 

2393
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:03,069
the ground oh everything in the body is
probably helping turn because they're

2394
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:03,079
probably helping turn because they're
 

2395
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,470
probably helping turn because they're
chasing something that's trying to get

2396
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:04,480
chasing something that's trying to get
 

2397
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,589
chasing something that's trying to get
away that's also zigzagging around but I

2398
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:08,599
away that's also zigzagging around but I
 

2399
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:10,470
away that's also zigzagging around but I
I I would be remiss if I didn't say you

2400
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,480
I I would be remiss if I didn't say you
 

2401
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,670
I I would be remiss if I didn't say you
know humans are are pretty pretty good

2402
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:12,680
know humans are are pretty pretty good
 

2403
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,710

too you know you watch gymnast uh

2404
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,720
too you know you watch gymnast uh
 

2405
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,270
too you know you watch gymnast uh
especially these days they're doing just

2406
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:17,280
especially these days they're doing just
 

2407
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,069
especially these days they're doing just
incredible uh stuff well like especially

2408
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:20,079
incredible uh stuff well like especially
 

2409
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,710
incredible uh stuff well like especially
like Olympic level gymnast see but there

2410
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:22,720
like Olympic level gymnast see but there
 

2411
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,549
like Olympic level gymnast see but there
could be I there could be cheetah their

2412
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559
could be I there could be cheetah their
 

2413
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,390
could be I there could be cheetah their
Olympic level we might be watching the

2414
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:26,400
Olympic level we might be watching the
 

2415
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,510
Olympic level we might be watching the
average cheetah versus like that could

2416
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:28,520
average cheetah versus like that could
 

2417
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,390
average cheetah versus like that could
be like a really special cheetah that

2418
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:30,400
be like a really special cheetah that
 

2419
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,710
be like a really special cheetah that
can do like you're right when did the

2420
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:32,720
can do like you're right when did the
 

2421
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,069
can do like you're right when did the
knees first come to play in in you

2422
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:36,079
knees first come to play in in you
 

2423
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,710
knees first come to play in in you
building legged robots uh in Big Dog big

2424
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
building legged robots uh in Big Dog big
 

2425
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,750
building legged robots uh in Big Dog big
dog yeah big dog came first and then

2426
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:40,760
dog yeah big dog came first and then
 

2427
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,470
dog yeah big dog came first and then
little dog was later and you know there

2428
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:43,480
little dog was later and you know there
 

2429
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,109
little dog was later and you know there
was a there's a big compromise there uh

2430
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:47,119
was a there's a big compromise there uh
 

2431
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,990
was a there's a big compromise there uh
human knees have multiple muscles and

2432
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:51,000
human knees have multiple muscles and
 

2433
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,710
human knees have multiple muscles and
you could argue that

2434
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:52,720
you could argue that
 

2435
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,750
you could argue that
there's uh I mean it's a technical thing

2436
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:55,760
there's uh I mean it's a technical thing
 

2437
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,589
there's uh I mean it's a technical thing
about negative work uh when you're when

2438
00:48:58,589 --> 00:48:58,599
about negative work uh when you're when
 

2439
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,710
about negative work uh when you're when
you're Contracting a joint but you're

2440
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:00,720
you're Contracting a joint but you're
 

2441
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,910
you're Contracting a joint but you're
pushing out that's negative work and if

2442
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:03,920
pushing out that's negative work and if
 

2443
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,750
pushing out that's negative work and if
you don't have a place to store that it

2444
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760
you don't have a place to store that it
 

2445
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,390
you don't have a place to store that it
can be very expensive to do negative

2446
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:07,400
can be very expensive to do negative
 

2447
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,630
can be very expensive to do negative
work and most of and in Big Dog there

2448
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:09,640
work and most of and in Big Dog there
 

2449
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,030
work and most of and in Big Dog there
was no place to store negative work uh

2450
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,040
was no place to store negative work uh
 

2451
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,789
was no place to store negative work uh
in the

2452
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:13,799
in the
 

2453
00:49:13,799 --> 00:49:18,030
in the
knees but big dog also had pogo stick uh

2454
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:18,040
knees but big dog also had pogo stick uh
 

2455
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,750

Springs down below so part of the action

2456
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:20,760
Springs down below so part of the action
 

2457
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,589

was to comply in a bouncing motion you

2458

was to comply in a bouncing motion you
 

2459
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,829
was to comply in a bouncing motion you
know later on in spot we we took that

2460
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:25,839
know later on in spot we we took that
 

2461
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:28,109
know later on in spot we we took that
out and as we got further and further

away from the leg lab uh we had more uh
 

2465
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,789
away from the leg lab uh we had more uh
you know energy-driven

00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:33,799
you know energy-driven
 

2467
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:35,870

2469
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,870
controls is there something to be said
about like knees that go uh forward

2470
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
about like knees that go uh forward
 

2471
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,150
about like knees that go uh forward
versus backward sure there's this idea

2472
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:43,160
versus backward sure there's this idea
 

2473
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:46,230
versus backward sure there's this idea
called the passive Dynamics which says

2474
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,240
called the passive Dynamics which says
 

2475
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,030
called the passive Dynamics which says
that although although you can use

2476
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:48,040
that although although you can use
 

2477
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,589
that although although you can use
computers and actuators to make a motion

2478
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:50,599
computers and actuators to make a motion
 

2479
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:52,750
computers and actuators to make a motion
a me a mechanical system can make a

2480
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:52,760
a me a mechanical system can make a
 

2481
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,950
a me a mechanical system can make a
motion just by itself if it gets

2482
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
motion just by itself if it gets
 

2483
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,750
motion just by itself if it gets
stimulated the right way uh so uh Tad

2484
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:58,760
stimulated the right way uh so uh Tad
 

2485
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,789
stimulated the right way uh so uh Tad
mcgear in the uh I think in the mid 80s

2486
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:02,799
mcgear in the uh I think in the mid 80s
 

2487
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,549
mcgear in the uh I think in the mid 80s
uh maybe it was in the late 80s starting

2488
00:50:04,549 --> 00:50:04,559
uh maybe it was in the late 80s starting
 

2489
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,190
uh maybe it was in the late 80s starting
to started to work on that and he made

2490
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:07,200
to started to work on that and he made
 

2491
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,950
to started to work on that and he made
this uh legged system that could walk

2492
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:09,960
this uh legged system that could walk
 

2493
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,349
this uh legged system that could walk
down an inclined plane where the legs

2494
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:12,359
down an inclined plane where the legs
 

2495
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:14,549
down an inclined plane where the legs
folded and unfolded and swung forward

2496
00:50:14,549 --> 00:50:14,559
folded and unfolded and swung forward
 

2497
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,309
folded and unfolded and swung forward
you know do the whole walk Walking

2498
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:16,319
you know do the whole walk Walking
 

2499
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,470
you know do the whole walk Walking
motion where the only thing there was no

2500
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:18,480
motion where the only thing there was no
 

2501
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,030
motion where the only thing there was no
computer there were some adjustments to

2502
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:21,040
computer there were some adjustments to
 

2503
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,270
computer there were some adjustments to
the mechanics so that there were dampers

2504
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:23,280
the mechanics so that there were dampers
 

2505
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,349
the mechanics so that there were dampers
and springs in some places that help the

2506
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:26,359
and springs in some places that help the
 

2507
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:28,589
and springs in some places that help the
uh the mechanical action happen it was

2508
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:28,599
uh the mechanical action happen it was
 

2509
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:30,870
uh the mechanical action happen it was
essentially a mechanical computer and

2510
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
essentially a mechanical computer and
 

2511
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,109
essentially a mechanical computer and
the idea the interesting idea there is

2512
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:34,119
the idea the interesting idea there is
 

2513
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:36,789
the idea the interesting idea there is
that it's not all about the brain uh

2514
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:36,799
that it's not all about the brain uh
 

2515
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:38,630
that it's not all about the brain uh
telling dictating to the body what the

2516
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,640
telling dictating to the body what the
 

2517
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,950
telling dictating to the body what the
body should do the body is a participant

2518
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:40,960
body should do the body is a participant
 

2519
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,190
body should do the body is a participant
in the motion so a a great design for a

2520
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:44,200
in the motion so a a great design for a
 

2521
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,950
in the motion so a a great design for a
robot has a mechanical component where

2522
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:46,960
robot has a mechanical component where
 

2523
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,710
robot has a mechanical component where
the movement is efficient even without a

2524
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,720
the movement is efficient even without a
 

2525
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,390
the movement is efficient even without a
brain yes how do you design that I think

2526
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:52,400
brain yes how do you design that I think
 

2527
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,470
brain yes how do you design that I think
that these days most robots aren't doing

2528
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
that these days most robots aren't doing
 

2529
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,910
that these days most robots aren't doing
that most robots are are basically using

2530
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:57,920
that most robots are are basically using
 

2531
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,829
that most robots are are basically using
the computer to to govern the motion now

2532
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:00,839
the computer to to govern the motion now
 

2533
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:03,589
the computer to to govern the motion now
the the brain though is taking into

2534
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:03,599
the the brain though is taking into
 

2535
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,829
the the brain though is taking into
account what the mechanical thing can do

2536
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:06,839
account what the mechanical thing can do
 

2537
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,190
account what the mechanical thing can do
uh and how it's going to behave

2538
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:08,200
uh and how it's going to behave
 

2539
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,030
uh and how it's going to behave
otherwise it would have to really

2540
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,040
otherwise it would have to really
 

2541
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,710
otherwise it would have to really
forcefully move everything around all

2542
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:12,720
forcefully move everything around all
 

2543
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,510
forcefully move everything around all
the time which probably some solutions

2544
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,520
the time which probably some solutions
 

2545
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,789
the time which probably some solutions
do but I think you end up with a more

2546
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:17,799
do but I think you end up with a more
 

2547
00:51:17,799 --> 00:51:19,589
do but I think you end up with a more
efficient and more graceful thing if

2548
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:19,599
efficient and more graceful thing if
 

2549
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,030
efficient and more graceful thing if
you're taking into account what the what

2550
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:22,040
you're taking into account what the what
 

2551
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,309
you're taking into account what the what
the machine wants to do so this might be

2552
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:24,319
the machine wants to do so this might be
 

2553
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,789
the machine wants to do so this might be
a good place to mention you're

2554
00:51:26,789 --> 00:51:26,799
a good place to mention you're
 

2555
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:29,789
a good place to mention you're
now uh leading up the the Boston

00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:29,799
now uh leading up the the Boston

Dynamics AI Institute newly formed which

2558
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:33,400
Dynamics AI Institute newly formed which
 

2559
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,190
Dynamics AI Institute newly formed which
is focused more on designing the robots

2560
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:36,200
is focused more on designing the robots
 

2561
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,150
is focused more on designing the robots
of the

2562
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:37,160
of the
 

2563
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,829
of the
future I think one of the things maybe

2564
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:39,839
future I think one of the things maybe
 

2565
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,670
future I think one of the things maybe
you can tell me the big vision for

2566
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:41,680
you can tell me the big vision for
 

2567
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,990
you can tell me the big vision for
what's going on but one of the things is

2568
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:45,000
what's going on but one of the things is
 

2569
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,950
what's going on but one of the things is
uh this idea that Hardware still matters

2570
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:47,960
uh this idea that Hardware still matters
 

2571
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,589
uh this idea that Hardware still matters
with with Organic design and so on maybe

2572
00:51:50,589 --> 00:51:50,599
with with Organic design and so on maybe
 

2573
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:53,430
with with Organic design and so on maybe
before that can you zoom out and tell me

2574
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:53,440
before that can you zoom out and tell me
 

2575
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,950
before that can you zoom out and tell me
what the vision is for the AI in

2576
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:55,960
what the vision is for the AI in
 

2577
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,510
what the vision is for the AI in
Institute you know I like to talk about

2578
00:51:58,510 --> 00:51:58,520
Institute you know I like to talk about
 

2579
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,390
Institute you know I like to talk about
intelligence having two parts an

2580
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:00,400
intelligence having two parts an
 

2581
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:04,510
intelligence having two parts an
athletic part and a cognitive part and

2582
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:04,520
athletic part and a cognitive part and
 

2583
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,510
athletic part and a cognitive part and
uh I think you know Boston Dynamics in

2584
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:06,520
uh I think you know Boston Dynamics in
 

2585
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,430
uh I think you know Boston Dynamics in
my view has sort of set the standard for

2586
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
my view has sort of set the standard for
 

2587
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,069
my view has sort of set the standard for
uh what athletic intelligence can be and

2588
00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:12,079
uh what athletic intelligence can be and
 

2589
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,069
uh what athletic intelligence can be and
you know it has to do with all the

2590
00:52:13,069 --> 00:52:13,079
you know it has to do with all the
 

2591
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,549
you know it has to do with all the
things we've been talking about the the

2592
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:15,559
things we've been talking about the the
 

2593
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:18,390
things we've been talking about the the
mechanical design the the real-time

2594
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
mechanical design the the real-time
 

2595
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,470
mechanical design the the real-time
control the energetics and that kind of

2596
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:20,480
control the energetics and that kind of
 

2597
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,150
control the energetics and that kind of
stuff but obviously uh people have

2598
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:23,160
stuff but obviously uh people have
 

2599
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,829
stuff but obviously uh people have
another kind of intelligence and and

2600
00:52:24,829 --> 00:52:24,839
another kind of intelligence and and
 

2601
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:25,870
another kind of intelligence and and
animals have another kind of

2602
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:25,880
animals have another kind of
 

2603
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,710
animals have another kind of
intelligence you know we can make a plan

2604
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:28,720
intelligence you know we can make a plan
 

2605
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,829
intelligence you know we can make a plan
uh our meeting started at at 9:30 I

2606
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:31,839
uh our meeting started at at 9:30 I
 

2607
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,910
uh our meeting started at at 9:30 I
looked up on Google Maps how long it

2608
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:33,920
looked up on Google Maps how long it
 

2609
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,390
looked up on Google Maps how long it
took to walk over here was you know 20

2610
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:36,400
took to walk over here was you know 20
 

2611
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,349
took to walk over here was you know 20
minutes so uh I decided okay I'd leave

2612
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
minutes so uh I decided okay I'd leave
 

2613
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,470
minutes so uh I decided okay I'd leave
my house at 9ine which is what I did um

2614
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:42,480
my house at 9ine which is what I did um
 

2615
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,470
my house at 9ine which is what I did um
you know simple intelligence but we use

2616
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,480
you know simple intelligence but we use
 

2617
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,510
you know simple intelligence but we use
that kind of stuff all the time it's

2618
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:46,520
that kind of stuff all the time it's
 

2619
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:48,069
that kind of stuff all the time it's
sort of what we think of as going on in

2620
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:48,079
sort of what we think of as going on in
 

2621
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:52,309
sort of what we think of as going on in
our heads um and I think that's in short

2622
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:52,319
our heads um and I think that's in short
 

2623
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,470
our heads um and I think that's in short
supply for robots most robots are pretty

2624
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:54,480
supply for robots most robots are pretty
 

2625
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,630
supply for robots most robots are pretty
dumb and as a result it takes a lot of

2626
00:52:57,630 --> 00:52:57,640
dumb and as a result it takes a lot of
 

2627
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,150
dumb and as a result it takes a lot of
skilled people to program them to do

2628
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,160
skilled people to program them to do
 

2629
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,910
skilled people to program them to do
everything they do and it takes a long

2630
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:02,920
everything they do and it takes a long
 

2631
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,870
everything they do and it takes a long
time and if robots are going to you know

2632
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:05,880
time and if robots are going to you know
 

2633
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,309
time and if robots are going to you know
satisfy our dreams uh they need to be

2634
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:09,319
satisfy our dreams uh they need to be
 

2635
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:15,150
satisfy our dreams uh they need to be
smarter uh so the in AI Institute is

2636
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:15,160
smarter uh so the in AI Institute is
 

2637
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,069
smarter uh so the in AI Institute is
designed to combine that physicality of

2638
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
designed to combine that physicality of
 

2639
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,950
designed to combine that physicality of
the athletic side with uh the cognitive

2640
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:20,960
the athletic side with uh the cognitive
 

2641
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,549
the athletic side with uh the cognitive
side so for instance we're trying to

2642
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:23,559
side so for instance we're trying to
 

2643
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:26,510
side so for instance we're trying to
make robots that can walk a human do a

2644
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:26,520
make robots that can walk a human do a
 

2645
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,789
make robots that can walk a human do a
task uh understand what it's seeing and

2646
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:29,799
task uh understand what it's seeing and
 

2647
00:53:29,799 --> 00:53:32,270
task uh understand what it's seeing and
then do the task itself so sort of OJT

2648
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:32,280
then do the task itself so sort of OJT
 

2649
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,309
then do the task itself so sort of OJT
for Rob on the job training for robots

2650
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:35,319
for Rob on the job training for robots
 

2651
00:53:35,319 --> 00:53:36,390
for Rob on the job training for robots
uh as a

2652
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
uh as a
 

2653
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,670
uh as a
paradigm uh now you know that's pretty

2654
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:38,680
paradigm uh now you know that's pretty
 

2655
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:41,230
paradigm uh now you know that's pretty
hard uh and it's it's sort of Science

2656
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:41,240
hard uh and it's it's sort of Science
 

2657
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:44,950
hard uh and it's it's sort of Science
Fiction but our idea is to work on a

2658
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:44,960
Fiction but our idea is to work on a
 

2659
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,190
Fiction but our idea is to work on a
longer time frame and and work on uh

2660
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:47,200
longer time frame and and work on uh
 

2661
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,990
longer time frame and and work on uh
solving those kinds of problems and I

2662
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:49,000
solving those kinds of problems and I
 

2663
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,190
solving those kinds of problems and I
have a whole list of things that are

2664
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:50,200
have a whole list of things that are
 

2665
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,230
have a whole list of things that are
kind of like in that in that vein maybe

2666
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:53,240
kind of like in that in that vein maybe
 

2667
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,829
kind of like in that in that vein maybe
we can just take many of the things you

2668
00:53:56,829 --> 00:53:56,839
we can just take many of the things you
 

2669
00:53:56,839 --> 00:53:59,190
we can just take many of the things you
mention just take it as a tangent okay

2670
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,200
mention just take it as a tangent okay
 

2671
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,750
mention just take it as a tangent okay
first of all athletic intelligence is a

2672
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:00,760
first of all athletic intelligence is a
 

2673
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:04,430
first of all athletic intelligence is a
super cool term uh and that's that

2674
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:04,440
super cool term uh and that's that
 

2675
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,270
super cool term uh and that's that
really is intelligence we humans kind of

2676
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:06,280
really is intelligence we humans kind of
 

2677
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,230
really is intelligence we humans kind of
take it for granted that we're so good

2678
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:08,240
take it for granted that we're so good
 

2679
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,109
take it for granted that we're so good
at walking and moving about the world

2680
00:54:10,109 --> 00:54:10,119
at walking and moving about the world
 

2681
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:11,990
at walking and moving about the world
and using our hands you know the

2682
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
and using our hands you know the
 

2683
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,789
and using our hands you know the
mechanics of interacting with all you

2684
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:13,799
mechanics of interacting with all you
 

2685
00:54:13,799 --> 00:54:15,470
mechanics of interacting with all you
know these parts I'll take these two

2686
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:15,480
know these parts I'll take these two
 

2687
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,670
know these parts I'll take these two
things you know you never touched those

2688
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:17,680
things you know you never touched those
 

2689
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,270
things you know you never touched those
before never tou well I've touched ones

2690
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,280
before never tou well I've touched ones
 

2691
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,309
before never tou well I've touched ones
like this look at all the things I can

2692
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:21,319
like this look at all the things I can
 

2693
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:23,109
like this look at all the things I can
do right I can juggle and I'm rotating

2694
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
do right I can juggle and I'm rotating
 

2695
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,630
do right I can juggle and I'm rotating
this way I can rotate it without looking

2696
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:25,640
this way I can rotate it without looking
 

2697
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:27,069
this way I can rotate it without looking
I could fetch these things out of my

2698
00:54:27,069 --> 00:54:27,079
I could fetch these things out of my
 

2699
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:28,789
I could fetch these things out of my
pocket and figure out which one was

2700
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:28,799
pocket and figure out which one was
 

2701
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:31,630
pocket and figure out which one was
which and all that kind of stuff and uh

2702
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:31,640
which and all that kind of stuff and uh
 

2703
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,510
which and all that kind of stuff and uh
I don't think we have much of a clue how

2704
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
I don't think we have much of a clue how
 

2705
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,390
I don't think we have much of a clue how
all that works yet right and that's I

2706
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:36,400
all that works yet right and that's I
 

2707
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,789
all that works yet right and that's I
really like putting that under the

2708
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:37,799
really like putting that under the
 

2709
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:40,349
really like putting that under the
banner of athletic uh

2710
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:40,359
banner of athletic uh
 

2711
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:42,789
banner of athletic uh
intelligence what are the big open

2712
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:42,799
intelligence what are the big open
 

2713
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,990
intelligence what are the big open
problems in athletic intelligence so

2714
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:45,000
problems in athletic intelligence so
 

2715
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,309

Dynamics with spot with Atlas just have

2718
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:49,280
Dynamics with spot with Atlas just have
 

2719
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,030
Dynamics with spot with Atlas just have
shown time and time again like push the

2720
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:52,040
shown time and time again like push the
 

2721
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,870
shown time and time again like push the
limits of what we think is possible with

2722
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:53,880
limits of what we think is possible with
 

2723
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,549
limits of what we think is possible with
robots but Where Do We Stand actually if

2724
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:56,559
robots but Where Do We Stand actually if
 

2725
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,109
robots but Where Do We Stand actually if
we kind of zoom out what are the big

2726
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
we kind of zoom out what are the big
 

2727
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:00,390
we kind of zoom out what are the big
open problems on the athletic

2728
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
open problems on the athletic
 

2729
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,390
open problems on the athletic
intelligence side I mean one question

2730
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
intelligence side I mean one question
 

2731
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,470
intelligence side I mean one question
you could ask isn't my question but you

2732
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:04,480
you could ask isn't my question but you
 

2733
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,470
you could ask isn't my question but you
know are they commercially uh viable uh

2734
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:07,480
know are they commercially uh viable uh
 

2735
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,990
know are they commercially uh viable uh
could will they increase productivity

2736
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:10,000
could will they increase productivity
 

2737
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,870
could will they increase productivity
yeah and I think you know we're getting

2738
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:11,880
yeah and I think you know we're getting
 

2739
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,109
yeah and I think you know we're getting
very close to that uh I don't think

2740
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:14,119
very close to that uh I don't think
 

2741
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:16,150
very close to that uh I don't think
we're quite there still you know most of

2742
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:16,160
we're quite there still you know most of
 

2743
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,390
we're quite there still you know most of
the robotics companies it's it's a it's

2744
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:18,400
the robotics companies it's it's a it's
 

2745
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,109
the robotics companies it's it's a it's
a struggle you know it's really the lack

2746
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,119
a struggle you know it's really the lack
 

2747
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,549
a struggle you know it's really the lack
of the cognitive side that probably is

2748
00:55:23,549 --> 00:55:23,559
of the cognitive side that probably is
 

2749
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:25,230
of the cognitive side that probably is
the biggest barrier at the moment even

2750
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:25,240
the biggest barrier at the moment even
 

2751
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,270
the biggest barrier at the moment even
for the physically successful robots but

2752
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:28,280
for the physically successful robots but
 

2753
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,710
for the physically successful robots but
uh you know your questions good I mean

2754
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:29,720
uh you know your questions good I mean
 

2755
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,549
uh you know your questions good I mean
you can always do a thing that's uh more

2756
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,559
you can always do a thing that's uh more
 

2757
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,230
you can always do a thing that's uh more
efficient lighter more reliable I'd say

2758
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:35,240
efficient lighter more reliable I'd say
 

2759
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,470
efficient lighter more reliable I'd say
reliability you know I know that spot

2760
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:37,480
reliability you know I know that spot
 

2761
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,470
reliability you know I know that spot
they've been working very hard uh on

2762
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:40,480
they've been working very hard uh on
 

2763
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,230
they've been working very hard uh on
getting the the tail of the reliability

2764
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:43,240
getting the the tail of the reliability
 

2765
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:46,109
getting the the tail of the reliability
curve up and they've made huge progress

2766
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:46,119
curve up and they've made huge progress
 

2767
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:48,670
curve up and they've made huge progress
so the robots you know there's a 1500 of

2768
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:48,680
so the robots you know there's a 1500 of
 

2769
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,150
so the robots you know there's a 1500 of
them out there now uh many of them being

2770
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:51,160
them out there now uh many of them being
 

2771
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,670
them out there now uh many of them being
used in uh practical applications stay

2772
00:55:54,670 --> 00:55:54,680
used in uh practical applications stay
 

2773
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,710
used in uh practical applications stay
in in day out uh where you know where

2774
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:57,720
in in day out uh where you know where
 

2775
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,670
in in day out uh where you know where
they have to work reliably and uh you

2776
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:00,680
they have to work reliably and uh you
 

2777
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,230
they have to work reliably and uh you
know it's very exciting that they've

2778
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,240
know it's very exciting that they've
 

2779
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,829
know it's very exciting that they've
done that but it takes a huge effort to

2780
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:03,839
done that but it takes a huge effort to
 

2781
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,190
done that but it takes a huge effort to
get that kind of reliability uh in the

2782
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:06,200
get that kind of reliability uh in the
 

2783
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,510
get that kind of reliability uh in the
robot there's cost too you know you'd

2784
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:08,520
robot there's cost too you know you'd
 

2785
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,990
robot there's cost too you know you'd
like to get the cost down uh spots are

2786
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,000
like to get the cost down uh spots are
 

2787
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,230
like to get the cost down uh spots are
still pretty

2788
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,240
still pretty
 

2789
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,549
still pretty
expensive uh and I don't think that they

2790
00:56:14,549 --> 00:56:14,559
expensive uh and I don't think that they
 

2791
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,750
expensive uh and I don't think that they
have to be but it takes you know a

2792
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
have to be but it takes you know a
 

2793
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,029
have to be but it takes you know a
different kind of activity to do that

2794
00:56:21,029 --> 00:56:21,039
different kind of activity to do that
 

2795
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,349
different kind of activity to do that
now that uh you know I think you know

2796
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:24,359
now that uh you know I think you know
 

2797
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:26,630
now that uh you know I think you know
that uh Boston Dynamics is owned

2798
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:26,640
that uh Boston Dynamics is owned
 

2799
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,910
that uh Boston Dynamics is owned
primarily by Hyundai now and I think

2800
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:28,920
primarily by Hyundai now and I think
 

2801
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,630
primarily by Hyundai now and I think
that the skills of Hyundai in making

2802
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:31,640
that the skills of Hyundai in making
 

2803
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,109
that the skills of Hyundai in making
cars can be brought to bear in uh uh

2804
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:35,119
cars can be brought to bear in uh uh
 

2805
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:37,750
cars can be brought to bear in uh uh
making robots that are less expensive

2806
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:37,760
making robots that are less expensive
 

2807
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,230
making robots that are less expensive
and more reliable and those kinds of

2808
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:39,240
and more reliable and those kinds of
 

2809
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,750
and more reliable and those kinds of
things so on the cognitive side uh for

2810
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:42,760
things so on the cognitive side uh for
 

2811
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,390
things so on the cognitive side uh for
the I institute what's what's the

2812
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
the I institute what's what's the
 

2813
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,390
the I institute what's what's the
tradeoff between moonshot projects for

2814
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:47,400
tradeoff between moonshot projects for
 

2815
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,510
tradeoff between moonshot projects for
you and maybe incremental progress

2816
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:50,520
you and maybe incremental progress
 

2817
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,390
you and maybe incremental progress
that's a good question I think we're

2818
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,400
that's a good question I think we're
 

2819
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,390
that's a good question I think we're
we're using the Paradigm called Stepping

2820
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
we're using the Paradigm called Stepping
 

2821
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,990
we're using the Paradigm called Stepping
Stones to to moonshots I don't I don't

2822
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:57,000
Stones to to moonshots I don't I don't
 

2823
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,750
Stones to to moonshots I don't I don't
believe and that that was in my original

2824
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
believe and that that was in my original
 

2825
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,309
believe and that that was in my original
proposal for The Institute Stepping

2826
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:01,319
proposal for The Institute Stepping
 

2827
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,870
proposal for The Institute Stepping
Stones to moonshots I think if you go

2828
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:03,880
Stones to moonshots I think if you go
 

2829
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,710
Stones to moonshots I think if you go
more than a year without seeing a

2830
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
more than a year without seeing a
 

2831
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,950
more than a year without seeing a
tangible status report of where you are

2832
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:09,960
tangible status report of where you are
 

2833
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,309
tangible status report of where you are
which is the stepping ststone uh and it

2834
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:12,319
which is the stepping ststone uh and it
 

2835
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,109
which is the stepping ststone uh and it
could be a simplification right you

2836
00:57:14,109 --> 00:57:14,119
could be a simplification right you
 

2837
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:16,549
could be a simplification right you
don't necessarily have to solve all the

2838
00:57:16,549 --> 00:57:16,559
don't necessarily have to solve all the
 

2839
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,390
don't necessarily have to solve all the
problems of your target goal even though

2840
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:18,400
problems of your target goal even though
 

2841
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,630
problems of your target goal even though
your target goal is going to take

2842
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:19,640
your target goal is going to take
 

2843
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,589
your target goal is going to take
several years uh you know those those

2844
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:22,599
several years uh you know those those
 

2845
00:57:22,599 --> 00:57:25,190
several years uh you know those those
stepping stone results give you feedback

2846
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,200
stepping stone results give you feedback
 

2847
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,990
stepping stone results give you feedback
uh give motivation because usually

2848
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:27,000
uh give motivation because usually
 

2849
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,109
uh give motivation because usually
there's some success in there uh and so

2850
00:57:30,109 --> 00:57:30,119
there's some success in there uh and so
 

2851
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:32,150
there's some success in there uh and so
you know that's the Mantra uh we've been

2852
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:32,160
you know that's the Mantra uh we've been
 

2853
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,270
you know that's the Mantra uh we've been
working on and that's pretty much how uh

2854
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
working on and that's pretty much how uh
 

2855
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,589
working on and that's pretty much how uh
you know i' I'd say Boston Dynamics has

2856
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:37,599
you know i' I'd say Boston Dynamics has
 

2857
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,230
you know i' I'd say Boston Dynamics has
worked uh you know where you make

2858
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,240
worked uh you know where you make
 

2859
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,390
worked uh you know where you make
progress uh and show it as you go show

2860
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:43,400
progress uh and show it as you go show
 

2861
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,910
progress uh and show it as you go show
it to yourself if not to the world what

understand do the project I mentioned
 

2873
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,630

before you know we've broken that down

2874
00:57:57,630 --> 00:57:57,640
before you know we've broken that down
 

2875
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,710
before you know we've broken that down
into uh getting some progress with what

00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
into uh getting some progress with what
 

2877
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,789

is meaningfully watching something mean
 

2879
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:06,390
is meaningfully watching something mean
uh breaking down uh an observation of a

you know you watch me do something I'm

2886
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:12,680
you know you watch me do something I'm
 

2887
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,230
you know you watch me do something I'm
gonna pick up this thing and put it down

2888
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:14,240
gonna pick up this thing and put it down
 

2889
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,349
gonna pick up this thing and put it down
here and stack this on it well it's not

2890
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:16,359
here and stack this on it well it's not
 

2891
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:19,349
here and stack this on it well it's not
obvious if you just look at the raw data

2892
00:58:19,349 --> 00:58:19,359
obvious if you just look at the raw data
 

2893
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,910
obvious if you just look at the raw data
uh uh what the sequence of Acts are it's

2894
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:21,920
uh uh what the sequence of Acts are it's
 

2895
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,150
uh uh what the sequence of Acts are it's
it's really a creative intelligent act

2896
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,160
it's really a creative intelligent act
 

2897
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,349
it's really a creative intelligent act
for you to to break that down into the

2898
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:26,359
for you to to break that down into the
 

2899
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:28,589
for you to to break that down into the
pieces and understand them in a way so

2900
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:28,599
pieces and understand them in a way so
 

2901
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:31,390
pieces and understand them in a way so
you could say okay what skill do I need

2902
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:31,400
you could say okay what skill do I need
 

2903
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,270
you could say okay what skill do I need
to accomplish each of those things uh so

2904
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:34,280
to accomplish each of those things uh so
 

2905
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,870
to accomplish each of those things uh so
we're working on you know the front end

2906
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:35,880
we're working on you know the front end
 

2907
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,829
we're working on you know the front end
of of that kind of a problem where we

2908
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:37,839
of of that kind of a problem where we
 

2909
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:42,150
of of that kind of a problem where we
observe and translate the if it may be

2910
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:42,160
observe and translate the if it may be
 

2911
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,670
observe and translate the if it may be
video it may be live into uh a

2915
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:48,870
description of what we think is going on
and then try and map that into skills to

2916
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:48,880
and then try and map that into skills to
 

2917
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,470
and then try and map that into skills to
accomplish that and we been developing

2918
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:50,480
accomplish that and we been developing
 

2919
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,230
accomplish that and we been developing
skills as well so you know we have kind

2920
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:52,240
skills as well so you know we have kind
 

2921
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,870
skills as well so you know we have kind
of multiple stabs at the pieces of of

2922
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
of multiple stabs at the pieces of of
 

2923
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,630
of multiple stabs at the pieces of of
doing that and this is usually video of

2924
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:57,640
doing that and this is usually video of
 

2925
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,710
doing that and this is usually video of

00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,750
out with bicycle repair some simple
bicycle repair tasks that seems

2932
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
bicycle repair tasks that seems
 

2933
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,029
bicycle repair tasks that seems
complicated that seems really

2934
00:59:07,029 --> 00:59:07,039
complicated that seems really
 

2935
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:08,750
complicated that seems really
complicated it is but but there's some

2936
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:08,760
complicated it is but but there's some
 

2937
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,270
complicated it is but but there's some
parts of it that aren't like uh putting

2938
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280
parts of it that aren't like uh putting
 

2939
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,190
parts of it that aren't like uh putting
the seat in you know into the you know

2940
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:14,200
the seat in you know into the you know
 

2941
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,670
the seat in you know into the you know
you have a tube that goes inside of

2942
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:15,680
you have a tube that goes inside of
 

2943
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,549
you have a tube that goes inside of
another tube and there's a latch you

2944
00:59:17,549 --> 00:59:17,559
another tube and there's a latch you
 

2945
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:19,670
another tube and there's a latch you
know that's that should be within range

2946
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
know that's that should be within range
 

2947
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,270
know that's that should be within range
is it possible to to observe to watch a

2948
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:22,280
is it possible to to observe to watch a
 

2949
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,710
is it possible to to observe to watch a
video like this without having explicit

2950
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
video like this without having explicit
 

2951
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,670
video like this without having explicit
model of what a bicycle looks like I

2952
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:26,680
model of what a bicycle looks like I
 

2953
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,910
model of what a bicycle looks like I
think it is and I think that's the kind

2954
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:28,920
think it is and I think that's the kind
 

2955
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,109
think it is and I think that's the kind
of thing that people don't recognize let

2956
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:31,119
of thing that people don't recognize let
 

2957
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,549
of thing that people don't recognize let
me translate it to navigation you know

2958
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:34,559
me translate it to navigation you know
 

2959
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,190
me translate it to navigation you know
uh I think the basic Paradigm for

2960
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:37,200
uh I think the basic Paradigm for
 

2961
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,630
uh I think the basic Paradigm for
navigating a space is to get some kind

2962
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:39,640
navigating a space is to get some kind
 

2963
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,430
navigating a space is to get some kind
of sensor that tells you where an

2964
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:41,440
of sensor that tells you where an
 

2965
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,270
of sensor that tells you where an
obstacle is and what's open build a map

2966
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:44,280
obstacle is and what's open build a map
 

2967
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,789
obstacle is and what's open build a map
and then go through the space but if I

2968
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:46,799
and then go through the space but if I
 

2969
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:48,390
and then go through the space but if I
if we were doing on the job training

2970
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,400
if we were doing on the job training
 

2971
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,190
if we were doing on the job training
where I was giving you a task I wouldn't

2972
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:50,200
where I was giving you a task I wouldn't
 

2973
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,710
where I was giving you a task I wouldn't
have to say anything about the room

2974
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:51,720
have to say anything about the room
 

2975
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,870
have to say anything about the room
right we came in here uh all we did is

2976
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:53,880
right we came in here uh all we did is
 

2977
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,950
right we came in here uh all we did is
adjust the chair but we didn't say

2978
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:55,960
adjust the chair but we didn't say
 

2979
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,549
adjust the chair but we didn't say
anything about the room and you know we

2980
00:59:57,549 --> 00:59:57,559
anything about the room and you know we
 

2981
00:59:57,559 --> 00:59:59,430
anything about the room and you know we
could navigate it so I think there's

2982
00:59:59,430 --> 00:59:59,440
could navigate it so I think there's
 

2983
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,069
could navigate it so I think there's
opportunities to build that kind of

2984
01:00:01,069 --> 01:00:01,079
opportunities to build that kind of
 

2985
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:04,109
opportunities to build that kind of
navigation skill into robots uh and

2986
01:00:04,109 --> 01:00:04,119
navigation skill into robots uh and
 

2987
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:06,270
navigation skill into robots uh and
we're you know we're hoping to be able

2988
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:06,280
we're you know we're hoping to be able
 

2989
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,870
we're you know we're hoping to be able
to do that so operate successfully under

2990
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:08,880
to do that so operate successfully under
 

2991
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,549
to do that so operate successfully under
a lot of uncertainty like yeah and and

2992
01:00:11,549 --> 01:00:11,559
a lot of uncertainty like yeah and and
 

2993
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:13,549
a lot of uncertainty like yeah and and
lack of specification lack of

2994
01:00:13,549 --> 01:00:13,559
lack of specification lack of
 

2995
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,390
lack of specification lack of
specification I mean that's what sort of

2996
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:15,400
specification I mean that's what sort of
 

2997
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,549
specification I mean that's what sort of
intelligence is right kind of dealing

2998
01:00:17,549 --> 01:00:17,559
intelligence is right kind of dealing
 

2999
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:20,109
intelligence is right kind of dealing
with a Sit understanding a situation

3000
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:20,119
with a Sit understanding a situation
 

3001
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:22,789
with a Sit understanding a situation
even though it wasn't explained so H how

3002
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:22,799
even though it wasn't explained so H how
 

3003
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,270
even though it wasn't explained so H how
big of a role does machine learning

3004
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:25,280
big of a role does machine learning
 

3005
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,349
big of a role does machine learning
uh play in all of this is this more and

3006
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
uh play in all of this is this more and
 

3007
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,589
uh play in all of this is this more and
more learning

3008
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:29,599
more learning
 

3009
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,829
more learning
based you know since chat gbt which is a

3010
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:33,839
based you know since chat gbt which is a
 

3011
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:38,230
based you know since chat gbt which is a
year ago basically uh there's a huge

3012
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:38,240
year ago basically uh there's a huge
 

3013
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,950
year ago basically uh there's a huge
interest in that and a and a huge uh

3014
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
interest in that and a and a huge uh
 

3015
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,029
interest in that and a and a huge uh
optimism about it and I think that

3016
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:43,039
optimism about it and I think that
 

3017
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,710
optimism about it and I think that
there's a lot of things that machine

3018
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:44,720
there's a lot of things that machine
 

3019
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,470
there's a lot of things that machine
learn that kind of machine learning now

3020
01:00:46,470 --> 01:00:46,480
learn that kind of machine learning now
 

3021
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,710
learn that kind of machine learning now
Chris there's lots of different kinds of

3022
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:47,720
Chris there's lots of different kinds of
 

3023
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,670
Chris there's lots of different kinds of
machine learning I think there's a you

3024
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:49,680
machine learning I think there's a you
 

3025
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,430
machine learning I think there's a you
know a lot of interest and optimism

3026
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:51,440
know a lot of interest and optimism
 

3027
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,109
know a lot of interest and optimism
about it I think the you know the facts

3028
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:54,119
about it I think the you know the facts
 

3029
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,109
about it I think the you know the facts
on the ground are that doing physical

3030
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:57,119
on the ground are that doing physical
 

3031
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,870
on the ground are that doing physical
things with physical robots is a little

3032
01:00:58,870 --> 01:00:58,880
things with physical robots is a little
 

3033
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,630
things with physical robots is a little
bit different than language and the

3034
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:01,640
bit different than language and the
 

3035
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,910
bit different than language and the
tokens you know the tokens sort of don't

3036
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:03,920
tokens you know the tokens sort of don't
 

3037
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,670
tokens you know the tokens sort of don't
exist you know pixel pixel values aren't

3038
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:06,680
exist you know pixel pixel values aren't
 

3039
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,950
exist you know pixel pixel values aren't
like Words um but I think that there's a

3040
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:10,960
like Words um but I think that there's a
 

3041
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,829
like Words um but I think that there's a
lot that can be done there we have

3042
01:01:13,829 --> 01:01:13,839
lot that can be done there we have
 

3043
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:16,710
lot that can be done there we have
uh uh we have several people working on

3044
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:16,720
uh uh we have several people working on
 

3045
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:18,549
uh uh we have several people working on
machine learning approaches I don't know

3046
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:18,559
machine learning approaches I don't know
 

3047
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:20,470
machine learning approaches I don't know
if you know but we we opened an office

3048
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
if you know but we we opened an office
 

3049
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,630
if you know but we we opened an office
in Zurich recently and uh Marco hutter

3050
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:23,640
in Zurich recently and uh Marco hutter
 

3051
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,309
in Zurich recently and uh Marco hutter
who's one of the real leaders in uh

3052
01:01:26,309 --> 01:01:26,319
who's one of the real leaders in uh
 

3053
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,910
who's one of the real leaders in uh
reinforcement learning for robots uh is

3054
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:28,920
reinforcement learning for robots uh is
 

3055
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:31,670
reinforcement learning for robots uh is
the the director of that office he's

3056
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:31,680
the the director of that office he's
 

3057
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,789
the the director of that office he's
still halftime at uh

3058
01:01:33,789 --> 01:01:33,799
still halftime at uh
 

3059
01:01:33,799 --> 01:01:36,910
still halftime at uh
eth uh the university there where he has

3060
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:36,920
eth uh the university there where he has
 

3061
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:39,430
eth uh the university there where he has
an unbelievably fantastic lab and then

3062
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:39,440
an unbelievably fantastic lab and then
 

3063
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,510
an unbelievably fantastic lab and then
he's halftime uh leading uh will be

3064
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:42,520
he's halftime uh leading uh will be
 

3065
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,349
he's halftime uh leading uh will be
leading off efforts in the Zurich office

3066
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:45,359
leading off efforts in the Zurich office
 

3067
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:47,470
leading off efforts in the Zurich office
so we have a healthy uh learning

3068
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:47,480
so we have a healthy uh learning
 

3069
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,750
so we have a healthy uh learning
component but there's part of me that

3070
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
component but there's part of me that
 

3071
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:51,589
component but there's part of me that
still says if you look out in the world

3072
01:01:51,589 --> 01:01:51,599
still says if you look out in the world
 

3073
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:54,230
still says if you look out in the world
at what the most impressive performances

3074
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,240
at what the most impressive performances
 

3075
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,589
at what the most impressive performances
are are they're still pretty much uh I

3076
01:01:58,589 --> 01:01:58,599
are are they're still pretty much uh I
 

3077
01:01:58,599 --> 01:01:59,990
are are they're still pretty much uh I
hate to use the word traditional but

3078
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:00,000
hate to use the word traditional but
 

3079
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:00,990
hate to use the word traditional but
that's what everybody's calling it

3080
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:01,000
that's what everybody's calling it
 

3081
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,829
that's what everybody's calling it
traditional controls like model

3082
01:02:02,829 --> 01:02:02,839
traditional controls like model
 

3083
01:02:02,839 --> 01:02:04,109

predictive
control uh you know the thing the the

3086
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:06,640
control uh you know the thing the the
 

3087
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,670
control uh you know the thing the the
atlas performances that you've seen are

3088
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:08,680
atlas performances that you've seen are
 

3089
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,470
atlas performances that you've seen are
mostly model predictive control they've

3090
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480
mostly model predictive control they've
 

3091
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,910
mostly model predictive control they've
started to do some learning stuff that's

3092
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:11,920
started to do some learning stuff that's
 

3093
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,910
started to do some learning stuff that's
really incredible I don't know if it's

3094
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:13,920
really incredible I don't know if it's
 

3095
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,990
really incredible I don't know if it's
all been shown yet but you'll see it

3096
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,000
all been shown yet but you'll see it
 

3097
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,549
all been shown yet but you'll see it
over over time um and then Marco's done

3098
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:19,559
over over time um and then Marco's done
 

3099
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:21,670
over over time um and then Marco's done
some great stuff and and others so

3100
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:21,680
some great stuff and and others so
 

3101
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,430
some great stuff and and others so
especially for the athletic intelligent

3102
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:23,440
especially for the athletic intelligent
 

3103
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,349
especially for the athletic intelligent
piece uh the traditional approach seems

3104
01:02:26,349 --> 01:02:26,359
piece uh the traditional approach seems
 

3105
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:28,789
piece uh the traditional approach seems
to be the one that still performs the

3106
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:28,799
to be the one that still performs the
 

3107
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,510
to be the one that still performs the
best I think we're going to find a a

3108
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:30,520
best I think we're going to find a a
 

3109
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,390
best I think we're going to find a a
mating of the two and we'll have the

3110
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400
mating of the two and we'll have the
 

3111
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,190
mating of the two and we'll have the
best of both worlds and we're working on

3112
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:34,200
best of both worlds and we're working on
 

3113
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,549
best of both worlds and we're working on
that at the Institute too if I can talk

3114
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559
that at the Institute too if I can talk
 

3115
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:38,470
that at the Institute too if I can talk
to you about teams you've built an

3116
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:38,480
to you about teams you've built an
 

3117
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,430
to you about teams you've built an
incredible team of Boss Dynamics before

3118
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:40,440
incredible team of Boss Dynamics before
 

3119
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,190
incredible team of Boss Dynamics before
at MIT and CMU at Boston Dynamics and

3120
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,200
at MIT and CMU at Boston Dynamics and
 

3121
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,630
at MIT and CMU at Boston Dynamics and
now at the AI Institute and you said

3122
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:45,640
now at the AI Institute and you said
 

3123
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,589
now at the AI Institute and you said
that there's four components to a great

3124
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:47,599
that there's four components to a great
 

3125
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:52,190
that there's four components to a great
team uh technical fearlessness diligence

3126
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:52,200
team uh technical fearlessness diligence
 

3127
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,069
team uh technical fearlessness diligence
intrepidness and fun technical fun can

3128
01:02:55,069 --> 01:02:55,079
intrepidness and fun technical fun can
 

3129
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:57,230
intrepidness and fun technical fun can
you explain each technical fearlessness

3130
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:57,240
you explain each technical fearlessness
 

3131
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,150
you explain each technical fearlessness
what do you mean by that sure uh

3132
01:02:59,150 --> 01:02:59,160
what do you mean by that sure uh
 

3133
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,950
what do you mean by that sure uh
technical fearlessness means being

3134
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:00,960
technical fearlessness means being
 

3135
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,349
technical fearlessness means being
willing to take on a problem that you

3136
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:02,359
willing to take on a problem that you
 

3137
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:06,430
willing to take on a problem that you
don't know how to solve uh and you know

3138
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:06,440
don't know how to solve uh and you know
 

3139
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,069
don't know how to solve uh and you know
uh study it uh figure out an an entry

3140
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:10,079
uh study it uh figure out an an entry
 

3141
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,630
uh study it uh figure out an an entry
point you know maybe a simplified

3142
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:11,640
point you know maybe a simplified
 

3143
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,870
point you know maybe a simplified
version or a simplified solution or

3144
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:13,880
version or a simplified solution or
 

3145
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,789
version or a simplified solution or
something learn from the stepping stone

3146
01:03:17,789 --> 01:03:17,799
something learn from the stepping stone
 

3147
01:03:17,799 --> 01:03:22,309
something learn from the stepping stone
and uh and go back and uh

3148
01:03:22,309 --> 01:03:22,319
and uh and go back and uh
 

3149
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,829
and uh and go back and uh
eventually make a solution that

3150
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:24,839
eventually make a solution that
 

3151
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:27,150
eventually make a solution that
meets your goals and I think that's

3152
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:27,160
meets your goals and I think that's
 

3153
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,150
meets your goals and I think that's
really important the fearlessness comes

3154
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:29,160
really important the fearlessness comes
 

3155
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,510
really important the fearlessness comes
into play because some of it has never

3156
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,520
into play because some of it has never
 

3157
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,710
into play because some of it has never
been done before yeah and you don't know

3158
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:33,720
been done before yeah and you don't know
 

3159
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,870
been done before yeah and you don't know
how to do it and you know there's easier

3160
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:35,880
how to do it and you know there's easier
 

3161
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,670
how to do it and you know there's easier
stuff to do in life uh so you know I

3162
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:40,680
stuff to do in life uh so you know I
 

3163
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,870
stuff to do in life uh so you know I
mean I don't know watch understand do

3164
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:42,880
mean I don't know watch understand do
 

3165
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,990
mean I don't know watch understand do
it's a it's a mountain of a of a

3166
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:45,000
it's a it's a mountain of a of a
 

3167
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,870
it's a it's a mountain of a of a
challenge so that's the really big

3168
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:46,880
challenge so that's the really big
 

3169
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,710
challenge so that's the really big
challenge you're you're tackling now can

3170
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:48,720
challenge you're you're tackling now can
 

3171
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,230
challenge you're you're tackling now can
we watch humans at scale and have robots

3172
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:52,240
we watch humans at scale and have robots
 

3173
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:55,789
we watch humans at scale and have robots
by watching humans become effective

3174
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:55,799
by watching humans become effective
 

3175
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:58,549
by watching humans become effective
actors in the world yeah I mean we have

3176
01:03:58,549 --> 01:03:58,559
actors in the world yeah I mean we have
 

3177
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:00,470
actors in the world yeah I mean we have
others like that I we have one called

3178
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:00,480
others like that I we have one called
 

3179
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,430
others like that I we have one called
inspect diagnose fix like uh you know

3180
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,440
inspect diagnose fix like uh you know
 

3181
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,829
inspect diagnose fix like uh you know
you uh call up the mayag repairment okay

3182
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:06,839
you uh call up the mayag repairment okay
 

3183
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:08,269
you uh call up the mayag repairment okay
he's the one who you don't have to call

3184
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:08,279
he's the one who you don't have to call
 

3185
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:10,950
he's the one who you don't have to call
but you you you know you call up the the

3186
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:10,960
but you you you know you call up the the
 

3187
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,150
but you you you know you call up the the
dishwasher repair person and they come

3188
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:13,160
dishwasher repair person and they come
 

3189
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:15,109
dishwasher repair person and they come
to your house and they look at your

3190
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:15,119
to your house and they look at your
 

3191
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:18,269
to your house and they look at your
machine it's already been actually

3192
01:04:18,269 --> 01:04:18,279
machine it's already been actually
 

3193
01:04:18,279 --> 01:04:19,990
machine it's already been actually
figured out that something doesn't work

3194
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,000
figured out that something doesn't work
 

3195
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,829
figured out that something doesn't work
but they have to kind of examine it and

3196
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:21,839
but they have to kind of examine it and
 

3197
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,230
but they have to kind of examine it and
figure out what what's wrong and then

3198
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:24,240
figure out what what's wrong and then
 

3199
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,390
figure out what what's wrong and then
fix it m and uh I think robots should be

3200
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:27,400
fix it m and uh I think robots should be
 

3201
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,510
fix it m and uh I think robots should be
able to do that uh we already Boston

3202
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:30,520
able to do that uh we already Boston
 

3203
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,510
able to do that uh we already Boston
Dynamics already has spot

with the physical skills to do it yeah
 

3227
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:02,109
with the physical skills to do it yeah
and you're referring to the fixing in

3228
01:05:02,109 --> 01:05:02,119
and you're referring to the fixing in
 

3229
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:03,670
and you're referring to the fixing in
the physical world I can't wait until it

the physical world I can't wait until it
can fix the psychological problems of

01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,520
can fix the psychological problems of
 

3233

01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:10,240
yeah that's a that's a different thing
 

3237
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,190
yeah that's a that's a different thing
yeah it's a different well it's all part

3238
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:12,200
yeah it's a different well it's all part
 

3239
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,789
yeah it's a different well it's all part
of the same thing again

3240
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:14,799
of the same thing again
 

3241
01:05:14,799 --> 01:05:18,390
of the same thing again
Humanity maybe maybe you mean convincing

3242
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,400
Humanity maybe maybe you mean convincing
 

3243
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,789
Humanity maybe maybe you mean convincing
you it's okay that the dishwasher is

3244
01:05:19,789 --> 01:05:19,799
you it's okay that the dishwasher is
 

3245
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:21,430
you it's okay that the dishwasher is
broken just do

3246
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:21,440
broken just do
 

3247
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,029
broken just do
the the marketing approach yeah exactly

3248
01:05:25,029 --> 01:05:25,039
the the marketing approach yeah exactly
 

3249
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:27,549
the the marketing approach yeah exactly
it's all yeah don't s don't don't sweat

3250
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:27,559
it's all yeah don't s don't don't sweat
 

3251
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:28,750
it's all yeah don't s don't don't sweat
the small

3252
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:28,760
the small
 

3253
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,829
the small
stuff yeah as opposed to fixing the

3254
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:30,839
stuff yeah as opposed to fixing the
 

3255
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:32,349
stuff yeah as opposed to fixing the
dishwasher it'll convince you that it's

3256
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:32,359
dishwasher it'll convince you that it's
 

3257
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:34,190
dishwasher it'll convince you that it's
okay that the dishwasher is broken it's

3258
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:34,200
okay that the dishwasher is broken it's
 

3259
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,990
okay that the dishwasher is broken it's
a different

3260
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,000
a different
 

3261
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,309
a different
approach uh diligence why is diligence

3262
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:39,319
approach uh diligence why is diligence
 

3263
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:41,390
approach uh diligence why is diligence
important well if you want a real robot

3264
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:41,400
important well if you want a real robot
 

3265
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,990
important well if you want a real robot
solution it can't be uh a very narrow

3266
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,000
solution it can't be uh a very narrow
 

3267
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,950
solution it can't be uh a very narrow
Solution that's going to break at the

3268
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:47,960
Solution that's going to break at the
 

3269
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:51,470
Solution that's going to break at the
first variation in what the robot does

3270
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:51,480
first variation in what the robot does
 

3271
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,269
first variation in what the robot does
or the environment if it wasn't exactly

3272
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:53,279
or the environment if it wasn't exactly
 

3273
01:05:53,279 --> 01:05:54,950
or the environment if it wasn't exactly
as you expected it

3274
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:54,960
as you expected it
 

3275
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,549
as you expected it
so how do you get there I think uh

3276
01:05:57,549 --> 01:05:57,559
so how do you get there I think uh
 

3277
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:00,269
so how do you get there I think uh
having an approach that leaves you

3278
01:06:00,269 --> 01:06:00,279
having an approach that leaves you
 

3279
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:02,910
having an approach that leaves you
unsatisfied until you've embraced the

3280
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:02,920
unsatisfied until you've embraced the
 

3281
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,870
unsatisfied until you've embraced the
bigger problem is the is the diligence

3282
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:04,880
bigger problem is the is the diligence
 

3283
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,549
bigger problem is the is the diligence
I'm talking about and uh again I'll

3284
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:08,559
I'm talking about and uh again I'll
 

3285
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:10,069
I'm talking about and uh again I'll
point at boss Dynamics I think they've

3286
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:10,079
point at boss Dynamics I think they've
 

3287
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:12,309
point at boss Dynamics I think they've
done you know some of the videos that we

3288
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:12,319
done you know some of the videos that we
 

3289
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:15,710
done you know some of the videos that we
had showing the engineer making it hard

3290
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:15,720
had showing the engineer making it hard
 

3291
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:19,309
had showing the engineer making it hard
for the robot to do its task uh spot

3292
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:19,319
for the robot to do its task uh spot
 

3293
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:21,309
for the robot to do its task uh spot
opening a door and then the guy gets

3294
01:06:21,309 --> 01:06:21,319
opening a door and then the guy gets
 

3295
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:22,990
opening a door and then the guy gets
there and pushes on the door so it

3296
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:23,000
there and pushes on the door so it
 

3297
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,390
there and pushes on the door so it
doesn't open the way it's supposed to

3298
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,400
doesn't open the way it's supposed to
 

3299
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,390
doesn't open the way it's supposed to
pulling on the on the Rope that's

3300
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
pulling on the on the Rope that's
 

3301
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,710
pulling on the on the Rope that's
attached to the robot so it's navigation

3302
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:28,720
attached to the robot so it's navigation
 

3303
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,990
attached to the robot so it's navigation
has been screwed up uh we have one where

3304
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:31,000
has been screwed up uh we have one where
 

3305
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,950
has been screwed up uh we have one where
the robot's climbing stairs and an

3306
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:32,960
the robot's climbing stairs and an
 

3307
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,630
the robot's climbing stairs and an
engineer is tugging on a rope that's

3308
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:34,640
engineer is tugging on a rope that's
 

3309
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,789
engineer is tugging on a rope that's
pulling it back down the stairs you know

3310
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:36,799
pulling it back down the stairs you know
 

3311
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,870
pulling it back down the stairs you know
that's totally different than just the

3312
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:38,880
that's totally different than just the
 

3313
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,309
that's totally different than just the
robot seeing the stairs making a model

3314
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:41,319
robot seeing the stairs making a model
 

3315
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:43,630
robot seeing the stairs making a model
putting its feet carefully on each step

3316
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:43,640
putting its feet carefully on each step
 

3317
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,829
putting its feet carefully on each step
but that's what probably robotics needs

3318
01:06:45,829 --> 01:06:45,839
but that's what probably robotics needs
 

3319
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,910
but that's what probably robotics needs
to succeed and having that

broader that broader idea that you want
 

3323
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,430
broader that broader idea that you want
to come up with a robust solution is

3324
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:52,440
to come up with a robust solution is
 

3325
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,589
to come up with a robust solution is
what I meant by diligence

3326
01:06:54,589 --> 01:06:54,599
what I meant by diligence
 

3327
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,470
what I meant by diligence
so really testing it in all conditions

door I mean the it's it's great testing

3340
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,440
door I mean the it's it's great testing
 

3341
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,150
door I mean the it's it's great testing
but it's

3342
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:13,160
but it's
 

3343
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,029
but it's
also I don't know it's just somehow

3344

hopping machine if you just show a video

3354
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:27,880
hopping machine if you just show a video
 

3355
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,069

of it
 

3357
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:32,069
of it
hopping it's a so what if you show it

3358
01:07:32,069 --> 01:07:32,079
hopping it's a so what if you show it
 

3359
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:33,870
hopping it's a so what if you show it
falling over a couple of times and you

3360
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:33,880
falling over a couple of times and you
 

3361
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,269
falling over a couple of times and you
can see how easily and fast it falls

3362
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:36,279
can see how easily and fast it falls
 

3363
01:07:36,279 --> 01:07:38,549
can see how easily and fast it falls
over then you appreciate what the

3364
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:38,559
over then you appreciate what the
 

3365
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,710
over then you appreciate what the
robot's doing when it's when it's doing

3366
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:40,720
robot's doing when it's when it's doing
 

3367
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,990
robot's doing when it's when it's doing
its thing so I think you know you're the

3368
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:43,000
its thing so I think you know you're the
 

3369
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,430
its thing so I think you know you're the
reaction you just gave to the D the

3370
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:45,440
reaction you just gave to the D the
 

3371
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,710
reaction you just gave to the D the

01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:52,440
it's showing you the scope of the
 

3377
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,349
it's showing you the scope of the
solution the the limits of the system

3378
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:55,359

the the challenges involved in Failure
 

3381
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,750
the the challenges involved in Failure
if showing both failure and success

3382
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
if showing both failure and success
 

3383
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:01,910
if showing both failure and success
makes you appreciate the the success

3384
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:01,920
makes you appreciate the the success
 

3385
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:04,190
makes you appreciate the the success
yeah and then just the way the videos

3386
01:08:04,190 --> 01:08:04,200
yeah and then just the way the videos
 

3387
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,589
yeah and then just the way the videos
are done in Boston dyamics are

3388
01:08:05,589 --> 01:08:05,599
are done in Boston dyamics are

3394
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:12,079
production is just raw testing of the
 

3395
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,829
production is just raw testing of the
robot well you know I was the final edit

3396
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:14,839
robot well you know I was the final edit
 

3397
01:08:14,839 --> 01:08:17,590
robot well you know I was the final edit
for most of the videos up

3398
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:17,600
for most of the videos up
 

3399
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:21,390
for most of the videos up
until uh until about three years ago or

3400
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:21,400
until uh until about three years ago or
 

3401
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,309
until uh until about three years ago or
four years ago and uh you know my theory

3402
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:24,319
four years ago and uh you know my theory
 

3403
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:27,749
four years ago and uh you know my theory
of the video is no no explanation if

3404
01:08:27,749 --> 01:08:27,759
of the video is no no explanation if
 

3405
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,990
of the video is no no explanation if
they can't see it then it's not the

3406
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:31,000
they can't see it then it's not the
 

3407
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,789
they can't see it then it's not the
right thing and if you do something

3408
01:08:33,789 --> 01:08:33,799
right thing and if you do something
 

3409
01:08:33,799 --> 01:08:36,709
right thing and if you do something
Worth showing then let them see it don't

3410
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:36,719
Worth showing then let them see it don't
 

3411
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:39,950
Worth showing then let them see it don't
don't interfere with uh you know a bunch

3412
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:39,960
don't interfere with uh you know a bunch
 

3413
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,070
don't interfere with uh you know a bunch
of titles that slow you down or a bunch

3414
01:08:43,070 --> 01:08:43,080
of titles that slow you down or a bunch
 

3415
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,630
of titles that slow you down or a bunch
of distraction just you know do

3416
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:45,640
of distraction just you know do
 

3417
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,870
of distraction just you know do
something Worth showing and then show it

3418
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:47,880
something Worth showing and then show it
 

3419
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,789
something Worth showing and then show it
that's brilliant it's hard it's hard

3420
01:08:49,789 --> 01:08:49,799
that's brilliant it's hard it's hard
 

3421
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:53,510
that's brilliant it's hard it's hard
though for for people to buy into that

3422
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:53,520
though for for people to buy into that
 

3423
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,110
though for for people to buy into that
yeah I mean people always want to add

3424
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,120
yeah I mean people always want to add
 

3425
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:58,309
yeah I mean people always want to add
more stuff but the Simplicity of just do

3426
01:08:58,309 --> 01:08:58,319
more stuff but the Simplicity of just do
 

3427
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:00,110
more stuff but the Simplicity of just do
something Worth showing and show it

3428
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:00,120
something Worth showing and show it
 

3429
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,070
something Worth showing and show it
that's brilliant and don't add extra

3430
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:02,080
that's brilliant and don't add extra
 

3431
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,390
that's brilliant and don't add extra
stuff now people people have

3432
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,400
stuff now people people have
 

3433
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,349
stuff now people people have
criticized uh especially the the big dog

3434
01:09:07,349 --> 01:09:07,359
criticized uh especially the the big dog
 

3435
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:10,110
criticized uh especially the the big dog
videos where there's a human uh driving

3436
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:10,120
videos where there's a human uh driving
 

3437
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,309
videos where there's a human uh driving
the robot and and I understand the

3438
01:09:12,309 --> 01:09:12,319
the robot and and I understand the
 

3439
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,149
the robot and and I understand the
criticism now at the time we wanted to

3440
01:09:14,149 --> 01:09:14,159
criticism now at the time we wanted to
 

3441
01:09:14,159 --> 01:09:15,990
criticism now at the time we wanted to
just show look this thing's using its

3442
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,000
just show look this thing's using its
 

3443
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,789
just show look this thing's using its
legs to get up the hill so we focused on

3444
01:09:17,789 --> 01:09:17,799
legs to get up the hill so we focused on
 

3445
01:09:17,799 --> 01:09:21,269
legs to get up the hill so we focused on
showing that which was we thought the

3446
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
showing that which was we thought the
 

3447
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,229
showing that which was we thought the
the story the fact that there was a

3448
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:23,239
the story the fact that there was a
 

3449
01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:24,709
the story the fact that there was a
human so they were thinking about

3450
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:24,719
human so they were thinking about
 

3451
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,789
human so they were thinking about
autonomy whereas we were thinking about

3452
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:26,799
autonomy whereas we were thinking about
 

3453
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:27,630
autonomy whereas we were thinking about
the the

3454
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:27,640
the the
 

3455
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,910
the the
mobility uh and so you know we've we've

3456
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:30,920
mobility uh and so you know we've we've
 

3457
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,070
mobility uh and so you know we've we've
adjusted to a lot of things that we see

3458
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:33,080
adjusted to a lot of things that we see
 

3459
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,749
adjusted to a lot of things that we see
that people care about uh trying to be

3460
01:09:35,749 --> 01:09:35,759
that people care about uh trying to be
 

3461
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,550
that people care about uh trying to be
honest we've always tried to be

3462
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:37,560
honest we've always tried to be
 

3463
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:41,070
honest we've always tried to be
honest but also just show cool stuff in

3464
01:09:41,070 --> 01:09:41,080
honest but also just show cool stuff in
 

3465
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,229
honest but also just show cool stuff in
this raw form the limits of the system

3466
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:44,239
this raw form the limits of the system
 

3467
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:46,189
this raw form the limits of the system
to see the system be perturbed and be

3468
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:46,199
to see the system be perturbed and be
 

3469
01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:47,669
to see the system be perturbed and be
robust and resilient and all that kind

3470
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
robust and resilient and all that kind
 

3471
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,550
robust and resilient and all that kind
of stuff and uh and dancing with some

3472
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:52,560
of stuff and uh and dancing with some
 

3473
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,030
of stuff and uh and dancing with some
music uh uh intrepidness and fun so

3474
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:57,040
music uh uh intrepidness and fun so
 

3475
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,310
music uh uh intrepidness and fun so
Intrepid I mean it might be the most

3476
01:09:59,310 --> 01:09:59,320
Intrepid I mean it might be the most
 

3477
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,189
Intrepid I mean it might be the most
important ingredient and that is you

3478
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
important ingredient and that is you
 

3479
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,910
important ingredient and that is you
know robotics is hard it's not going to

3480
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
know robotics is hard it's not going to
 

3481
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,189
know robotics is hard it's not going to
work right right away so don't be

3482
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:06,199
work right right away so don't be
 

3483
01:10:06,199 --> 01:10:09,030
work right right away so don't be
discouraged is all it really means so

3484
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:09,040
discouraged is all it really means so
 

3485
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,910
discouraged is all it really means so
usually when I talk about these things I

3486
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:10,920
usually when I talk about these things I
 

3487
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,310
usually when I talk about these things I
show videos and I show a long string of

3488
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:13,320
show videos and I show a long string of
 

3489
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,310
show videos and I show a long string of
outakes you know and you know you have

3490
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,320
outakes you know and you know you have
 

3491
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,630
outakes you know and you know you have
to have courage to be to be Intrepid

3492
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:19,640
to have courage to be to be Intrepid
 

3493
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,830
to have courage to be to be Intrepid
when you know you work so hard you built

3494
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:21,840
when you know you work so hard you built
 

3495
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,110
when you know you work so hard you built
your machine you know and then you're

3496
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:24,120
your machine you know and then you're
 

3497
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,630
your machine you know and then you're
trying and it just doesn't do what you

3498
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:26,640
trying and it just doesn't do what you
 

3499
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,550
trying and it just doesn't do what you
thought it would do what you want it to

3500
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:28,560
thought it would do what you want it to
 

3501
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:33,149
thought it would do what you want it to
do and uh you know you have to stick to

3502
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:33,159
do and uh you know you have to stick to
 

3503
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:36,550
do and uh you know you have to stick to
it and keep trying how long I mean we

3504
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:36,560
it and keep trying how long I mean we
 

3505
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,669
it and keep trying how long I mean we
don't often see that the story behind

3506
01:10:39,669 --> 01:10:39,679
don't often see that the story behind
 

3507
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:40,790
don't often see that the story behind
spot and

3508
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:40,800
spot and
 

3509
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,630
spot and
Atlas how long how many failures was

3510
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:43,640
Atlas how long how many failures was
 

3511
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,350
Atlas how long how many failures was
there along the way to get you know a

3512
01:10:45,350 --> 01:10:45,360
there along the way to get you know a
 

3513
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,430
there along the way to get you know a
working Atlas a working spot in the

3514
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:47,440
working Atlas a working spot in the
 

3515
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,630
working Atlas a working spot in the
early days even working big dog there's

3516
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:49,640
early days even working big dog there's
 

3517
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,430
early days even working big dog there's
a video of Atlas climbing three big

3518
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:52,440
a video of Atlas climbing three big
 

3519
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,709
a video of Atlas climbing three big
steps and it's very Dynamic and it's you

3520
01:10:54,709 --> 01:10:54,719
steps and it's very Dynamic and it's you
 

3521
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,270
steps and it's very Dynamic and it's you
know it's really exciting real

3522
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:56,280
know it's really exciting real
 

3523
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,110
know it's really exciting real
accomplishment it took uh 109 tries and

3524
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:00,120
accomplishment it took uh 109 tries and
 

3525
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,470
accomplishment it took uh 109 tries and
we have video of every one of them you

3526
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:01,480
we have video of every one of them you
 

3527
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,030
we have video of every one of them you
know we shoot everything again we this

3528
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:04,040
know we shoot everything again we this
 

3529
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,390
know we shoot everything again we this
is at Boston Dynamics um uh so it took

3530
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:08,400
is at Boston Dynamics um uh so it took
 

3531
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,870
is at Boston Dynamics um uh so it took
109 tries but once it did it it had a

3532
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:11,880
109 tries but once it did it it had a
 

3533
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:14,149
109 tries but once it did it it had a
high percentage of success so it's not

3534
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:14,159
high percentage of success so it's not
 

3535
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,990
high percentage of success so it's not
like we're cheating by just showing the

3536
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000
like we're cheating by just showing the
 

3537
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,910
like we're cheating by just showing the
best one but we do show the evolved you

3538
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:18,920
best one but we do show the evolved you
 

3539
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,149
best one but we do show the evolved you
know performance not everything along

3540
01:11:21,149 --> 01:11:21,159
know performance not everything along
 

3541
01:11:21,159 --> 01:11:22,790
know performance not everything along
the way but the everything along the way

01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:22,800
the way but the everything along the way
 

3543
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,910
the way but the everything along the way
is informative and you know it shows

3544
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:24,920
is informative and you know it shows
 

3545
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,310
is informative and you know it shows
sort of uh there's you know stupid

3546
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:28,320
sort of uh there's you know stupid
 

3547
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,110
sort of uh there's you know stupid
things that go wrong like like the robot

3548
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,120
things that go wrong like like the robot
 

3549
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,590
things that go wrong like like the robot
just when you say go and it collapses

3550
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:33,600
just when you say go and it collapses
 

3551
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,270
just when you say go and it collapses
right there on the start that doesn't

3552
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,280
right there on the start that doesn't
 

3553
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,149
right there on the start that doesn't
have to do with the steps uh or the

3554
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,159
have to do with the steps uh or the
 

3555
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:39,870
have to do with the steps uh or the
perception didn't work right so you miss

3556
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:39,880
perception didn't work right so you miss
 

3557
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:42,270
perception didn't work right so you miss
the target when you jump or something

3558
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:42,280
the target when you jump or something
 

3559
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,229
the target when you jump or something
breaks and there's oil flying everywhere

3560
01:11:45,229 --> 01:11:45,239
breaks and there's oil flying everywhere
 

3561
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:48,229
breaks and there's oil flying everywhere
uh but that's fun yeah so the hardware

3562
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
uh but that's fun yeah so the hardware
 

3563
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,310
uh but that's fun yeah so the hardware
failures and and maybe some software

3564
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:50,320
failures and and maybe some software
 

3565
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:52,550
failures and and maybe some software
lots of control of evolution during that

3566
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
lots of control of evolution during that
 

3567
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,229
lots of control of evolution during that
time I think it took six weeks to get

3568
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:54,239
time I think it took six weeks to get
 

3569
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:56,990
time I think it took six weeks to get
that those uh 109 trials you know

3570
01:11:56,990 --> 01:11:57,000
that those uh 109 trials you know
 

3571
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,550
that those uh 109 trials you know
because there was there was uh

3572
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
because there was there was uh
 

3573
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,070
because there was there was uh
programming going on you know it was it

3574
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:01,080
programming going on you know it was it
 

3575
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,629
programming going on you know it was it
was actually robot learning but there

3576
01:12:03,629 --> 01:12:03,639
was actually robot learning but there
 

3577
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:05,629
was actually robot learning but there
were human in the loop helping with the

3578
01:12:05,629 --> 01:12:05,639
were human in the loop helping with the
 

3579
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:09,430
were human in the loop helping with the
learning so all data driven but uh okay

3580
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:09,440
learning so all data driven but uh okay
 

3581
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,510
learning so all data driven but uh okay
and so and you always are learning from

3582
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
and so and you always are learning from
 

3583
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,870
and so and you always are learning from
that failure so

3584
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:13,880
that failure so
 

3585
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,669
that failure so
right and how do you how do you protect

3586
01:12:17,669 --> 01:12:17,679
right and how do you how do you protect
 

3587
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,110
right and how do you how do you protect
Atlas from not getting damaged from

3588
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:20,120
Atlas from not getting damaged from
 

3589
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,470
Atlas from not getting damaged from
109 uh

3590
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,480
109 uh
 

3591
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,470
109 uh
attempts it was re it's remarkable one

3592
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:25,480
attempts it was re it's remarkable one
 

3593
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,870
attempts it was re it's remarkable one
of the accomplishments of Atlas is that

3594
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:27,880
of the accomplishments of Atlas is that
 

3595
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,030
of the accomplishments of Atlas is that
the engineers have made a machine that's

3596
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:30,040
the engineers have made a machine that's
 

3597
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,350
the engineers have made a machine that's
robust enough that it can take that kind

3598
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:32,360
robust enough that it can take that kind
 

3599
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,550
robust enough that it can take that kind
of testing where it's falling and stuff

3600
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:34,560
of testing where it's falling and stuff
 

3601
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,510
of testing where it's falling and stuff
and it doesn't break every time it still

3602
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:36,520
and it doesn't break every time it still
 

3603
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,310
and it doesn't break every time it still
breaks and we had you know part of the

3604
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:39,320
breaks and we had you know part of the
 

3605
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,310
breaks and we had you know part of the
the Paradigm is to have people to repair

3606
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:41,320
the Paradigm is to have people to repair
 

3607
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,030
the Paradigm is to have people to repair
stuff you got to figure that in if

3608
01:12:43,030 --> 01:12:43,040
stuff you got to figure that in if
 

3609
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,790
stuff you got to figure that in if
you're going to do this kind of work um

3610
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:45,800
you're going to do this kind of work um
 

3611
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,110
you're going to do this kind of work um
you know I sometimes criticize the

3612
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:48,120
you know I sometimes criticize the
 

3613
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,390
you know I sometimes criticize the
people who have their goldplated thing

3614
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
people who have their goldplated thing
 

3615
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,870
people who have their goldplated thing
and they keep it on the shelf and

3616
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:51,880
and they keep it on the shelf and
 

3617
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,709
and they keep it on the shelf and
everybody and they're afraid to kind of

3618
01:12:53,709 --> 01:12:53,719
everybody and they're afraid to kind of
 

3619
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:54,950
everybody and they're afraid to kind of
use it I don't think you can make

3620
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:54,960
use it I don't think you can make
 

3621
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,950
use it I don't think you can make
progress if you're working that way you

3622
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:56,960
progress if you're working that way you
 

3623
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,950
progress if you're working that way you
you need to be ready to have it break

3624
01:12:58,950 --> 01:12:58,960
you need to be ready to have it break
 

3625
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,070
you need to be ready to have it break
and and go in there and fix it it's part

3626
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:01,080
and and go in there and fix it it's part
 

3627
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,629
and and go in there and fix it it's part
of the thing you know plan your budget

3628
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:02,639
of the thing you know plan your budget
 

3629
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:06,229
of the thing you know plan your budget
so you have spare parts and a crew and

3630
01:13:06,229 --> 01:13:06,239
so you have spare parts and a crew and
 

3631
01:13:06,239 --> 01:13:09,750
so you have spare parts and a crew and
all that stuff yeah if it falls 10 times

3632
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:09,760
all that stuff yeah if it falls 10 times
 

3633
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,030
all that stuff yeah if it falls 10 times
it's okay wow um so Intrepid truly and

3634
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:15,040
it's okay wow um so Intrepid truly and
 

3635
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,709
it's okay wow um so Intrepid truly and
that applies to spot that applies to all

3636
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:16,719
that applies to spot that applies to all
 

3637
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,470
that applies to spot that applies to all
the other re to everything I think it

do that's worth doing yeah and
 

3643
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,350
do that's worth doing yeah and
especially with system in the real world

3644
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:24,360
especially with system in the real world
 

3645
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:28,950
especially with system in the real world
right yeah uh and so fun fun technical

3646
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:28,960
right yeah uh and so fun fun technical
 

3647
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,550
right yeah uh and so fun fun technical
fun I usually say have technical fun I

3648
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:31,560
fun I usually say have technical fun I
 

3649
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:34,390
fun I usually say have technical fun I
think that the life as an engineer is

3650
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:34,400
think that the life as an engineer is
 

3651
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,310
think that the life as an engineer is
really

3652
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:35,320
really
 

3653
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:38,830
really
satisfying I think you get to uh you

3654
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:38,840
satisfying I think you get to uh you
 

3655
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,910
satisfying I think you get to uh you
know to some degree it can be like

3656
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:40,920
know to some degree it can be like
 

3657
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,550
know to some degree it can be like
crafts work where you get to do things

3658
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:42,560
crafts work where you get to do things
 

3659
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,189
crafts work where you get to do things
with your own hands or your own design

3660
01:13:44,189 --> 01:13:44,199
with your own hands or your own design
 

3661
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:46,669
with your own hands or your own design
or whatever your you know your media is

3662
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:46,679
or whatever your you know your media is
 

3663
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:48,430
or whatever your you know your media is
and it's very satisfying to be able to

3664
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:48,440
and it's very satisfying to be able to
 

3665
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,910
and it's very satisfying to be able to
just do the work unlike you know a lot

3666
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:50,920
just do the work unlike you know a lot
 

3667
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,070
just do the work unlike you know a lot
of people who have to do something that

3668
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:53,080
of people who have to do something that
 

3669
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,830
of people who have to do something that
they don't like doing I think Engineers

3670
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:54,840
they don't like doing I think Engineers
 

3671
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,030
they don't like doing I think Engineers
typically get to do something that they

3672
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
typically get to do something that they
 

3673
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,189
typically get to do something that they
that they like and there's a lot of

3674
01:13:58,189 --> 01:13:58,199
that they like and there's a lot of
 

3675
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:01,910
that they like and there's a lot of
satisfaction from that then there's um

3676
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:01,920
satisfaction from that then there's um
 

3677
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,310
satisfaction from that then there's um
you know in many cases you can have

3678
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:04,320
you know in many cases you can have
 

3679
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,310
you know in many cases you can have
impact uh on the world somehow because

3680
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:07,320
impact uh on the world somehow because
 

3681
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,750
impact uh on the world somehow because
you've done something that other people

3682
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:08,760
you've done something that other people
 

3683
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:11,149
you've done something that other people
admire which is different from the own

3684
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:11,159
admire which is different from the own
 

3685
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:13,270
admire which is different from the own
just the craft fund of of building a

3686
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:13,280
just the craft fund of of building a
 

3687
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:17,750
just the craft fund of of building a
thing uh so that's a second way that uh

3688
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:17,760
thing uh so that's a second way that uh
 

3689
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,870
thing uh so that's a second way that uh
that being engineer is good I think the

3690
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:19,880
that being engineer is good I think the
 

3691
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,030
that being engineer is good I think the
third thing is that that if you're lucky

3692
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:22,040
third thing is that that if you're lucky
 

3693
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,590
third thing is that that if you're lucky
to be working in a team where you're uh

3694
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:24,600
to be working in a team where you're uh
 

3695
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:26,270
to be working in a team where you're uh
getting the benefit of other people's

3696
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:26,280
getting the benefit of other people's
 

3697
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:27,870
getting the benefit of other people's
skills that are helping you do your

3698
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:27,880
skills that are helping you do your
 

3699
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,629
skills that are helping you do your
thing uh you know none of us has all the

3700
01:14:30,629 --> 01:14:30,639
thing uh you know none of us has all the
 

3701
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:33,550
thing uh you know none of us has all the
skills needed to do um most of these

3702
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:33,560
skills needed to do um most of these
 

3703
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,350
skills needed to do um most of these
projects and uh if you have a team where

3704
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:36,360
projects and uh if you have a team where
 

3705
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,390
projects and uh if you have a team where
you're working well with the others that

3706
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:38,400
you're working well with the others that
 

3707
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,310
you're working well with the others that
can be very satisfying and then if

3708
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:40,320
can be very satisfying and then if
 

3709
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,110
can be very satisfying and then if
you're an engineer you also usually get

3710
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:42,120
you're an engineer you also usually get
 

3711
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,030
you're an engineer you also usually get
paid and so you kind of get paid four

3712
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:45,040
paid and so you kind of get paid four
 

3713
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:47,709
paid and so you kind of get paid four
times yeah uh in my view of the world

3714
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:47,719
times yeah uh in my view of the world
 

3715
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:49,470
times yeah uh in my view of the world
yeah so what could be better than that

3716
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:49,480
yeah so what could be better than that
 

3717
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,590
yeah so what could be better than that
get paid to have fun I mean what what do

3718
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:51,600
get paid to have fun I mean what what do
 

3719
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,430
get paid to have fun I mean what what do
you love about engineering what when you

3720
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:53,440
you love about engineering what when you
 

3721
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,790
you love about engineering what when you
say engineering what does that what does

3722
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:54,800
say engineering what does that what does
 

3723
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:56,270
say engineering what does that what does
that mean to you exactly what is this

3724
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:56,280
that mean to you exactly what is this
 

3725
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:56,910
that mean to you exactly what is this
kind

3726
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:56,920
kind
 

3727
01:14:56,920 --> 01:15:00,430
kind
of big thing that we call engineering I

3728
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:00,440
of big thing that we call engineering I
 

3729
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,470
of big thing that we call engineering I
think it's both being a scientist or

3730
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:03,480
think it's both being a scientist or
 

3731
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,189
think it's both being a scientist or
getting to use science at the same time

3732
01:15:06,189 --> 01:15:06,199
getting to use science at the same time
 

3733
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:08,350
getting to use science at the same time
as being kind of an artist or a Creator

3734
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:08,360
as being kind of an artist or a Creator
 

3735
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:09,750
as being kind of an artist or a Creator
because you're making some you know

3736
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:09,760
because you're making some you know
 

3737
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,910
because you're making some you know
scientists only get to describe to to

3738
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:11,920
scientists only get to describe to to
 

3739
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,229
scientists only get to describe to to
study what's out there and engineers get

3740
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:14,239
study what's out there and engineers get
 

3741
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:15,830
study what's out there and engineers get
get to make stuff that didn't exist

3742
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:15,840
get to make stuff that didn't exist
 

3743
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,910
get to make stuff that didn't exist
before and so it's really I think a

3744
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:17,920
before and so it's really I think a
 

3745
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,149
before and so it's really I think a
higher calling even though I think most

3746
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
higher calling even though I think most
 

3747
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:21,629
higher calling even though I think most
you know the public out there thinks

3748
01:15:21,629 --> 01:15:21,639
you know the public out there thinks
 

3749
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:23,870
you know the public out there thinks
science is top and engineering is

3750
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:23,880
science is top and engineering is
 

3751
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,229
science is top and engineering is
somehow secondary but I think it's the

3752
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:25,239
somehow secondary but I think it's the
 

3753
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:27,709
somehow secondary but I think it's the
other way around and at The Cutting Edge

3754
01:15:27,709 --> 01:15:27,719
other way around and at The Cutting Edge
 

3755
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:30,229
other way around and at The Cutting Edge
I think when you when you talk about

3756
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:30,239
I think when you when you talk about
 

3757
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:34,390
I think when you when you talk about
robotics there is possibility to do art

3758
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,400
robotics there is possibility to do art
 

3759
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,070
robotics there is possibility to do art
in that you do like the first of its

3760
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
in that you do like the first of its
 

3761
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:38,629
in that you do like the first of its
kind thing so then there's a ma

3762
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:38,639
kind thing so then there's a ma
 

3763
01:15:38,639 --> 01:15:40,629
kind thing so then there's a ma
production at scale which is its own

3764
01:15:40,629 --> 01:15:40,639
production at scale which is its own
 

3765
01:15:40,639 --> 01:15:41,950
production at scale which is its own
beautiful thing but when you do the

3766
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:41,960
beautiful thing but when you do the
 

3767
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,550
beautiful thing but when you do the
first new robot or the First new thing

3768
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:44,560
first new robot or the First new thing
 

3769
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,790
first new robot or the First new thing
that's a possibility to create something

3770
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:46,800
that's a possibility to create something
 

3771
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,270
that's a possibility to create something
totally new that is bringing metal to

3772
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:49,280
totally new that is bringing metal to
 

3773
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,270
totally new that is bringing metal to
life or a machine to life is kind of is

3774
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:52,280
life or a machine to life is kind of is
 

3775
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,790
life or a machine to life is kind of is
fun and uh

3776
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:53,800
fun and uh
 

3777
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,709
fun and uh
you know it was fun doing the D the

3778
01:15:55,709 --> 01:15:55,719
you know it was fun doing the D the
 

3779
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:59,030
you know it was fun doing the D the
dancing videos where uh got a huge you

3780
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
dancing videos where uh got a huge you
 

3781
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,550
dancing videos where uh got a huge you
know public response and we're going to

3782
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
know public response and we're going to
 

3783
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,629
know public response and we're going to
do more can do some we're doing some at

3784
01:16:02,629 --> 01:16:02,639
do more can do some we're doing some at
 

3785
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:05,470
do more can do some we're doing some at
The Institute and we'll we'll do more

3786
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:05,480
The Institute and we'll we'll do more
 

3787
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:07,390
The Institute and we'll we'll do more
well that metal to life moment I mean to

3788
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:07,400
well that metal to life moment I mean to
 

3789
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,790
well that metal to life moment I mean to
me that's still magical like uh when

3790
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:09,800
me that's still magical like uh when
 

3791
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,750
me that's still magical like uh when
when uh inanimate object comes to life

3792
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
when uh inanimate object comes to life
 

3793
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,709
when uh inanimate object comes to life
that's still like to me to this day is

3794
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:16,719
that's still like to me to this day is
 

3795
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,430
that's still like to me to this day is
still an incredible moment the human

3796
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:18,440
still an incredible moment the human
 

3797
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,030
still an incredible moment the human
intelligence can

3798
01:16:20,030 --> 01:16:20,040
intelligence can
 

3799
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:24,229
intelligence can
create systems that instill life or

3800
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:24,239
create systems that instill life or
 

3801
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:27,149
create systems that instill life or
whatever that is in into inanimate

3802
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:27,159
whatever that is in into inanimate
 

3803
01:16:27,159 --> 01:16:29,390
whatever that is in into inanimate
objects it's is really it's truly

3804
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:29,400
objects it's is really it's truly
 

3805
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,149
objects it's is really it's truly
magical especially when it's at the

3806
01:16:31,149 --> 01:16:31,159
magical especially when it's at the
 

3807
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:34,350
magical especially when it's at the
scale of that humans can perceive and

3808
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:34,360
scale of that humans can perceive and
 

3809
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,030
scale of that humans can perceive and
appreciate like

3810
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:36,040
appreciate like
 

3811
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,110
appreciate like
directly but I think sort of with it

3812
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:38,120
directly but I think sort of with it
 

3813
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,709
directly but I think sort of with it
going going back to the pieces of that

3814
01:16:40,709 --> 01:16:40,719
going going back to the pieces of that
 

3815
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:42,990
going going back to the pieces of that
you know you design a linkage that turns

3816
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:43,000
you know you design a linkage that turns
 

3817
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,910
you know you design a linkage that turns
out to be half the weight and just as

3818
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:45,920
out to be half the weight and just as
 

3819
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,629
out to be half the weight and just as
strong that's that's very satisfying and

3820
01:16:48,629 --> 01:16:48,639
strong that's that's very satisfying and
 

3821
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:50,390
strong that's that's very satisfying and
you know there people who do that and

3822
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:50,400
you know there people who do that and
 

3823
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,750
you know there people who do that and
it's it's a creative a creative act uh

3824
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
it's it's a creative a creative act uh
 

3825
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,830
it's it's a creative a creative act uh
what what do you is the most beautiful

3826
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:56,840
what what do you is the most beautiful
 

3827
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,229
what what do you is the most beautiful
about

3828
01:16:58,229 --> 01:16:58,239
about
 

3829
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,590
about
robotics sorry for the big romantic

3830
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:00,600
robotics sorry for the big romantic
 

3831
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,750
robotics sorry for the big romantic
question I think having the robots move

3832
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:02,760
question I think having the robots move
 

3833
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:06,990
question I think having the robots move
in a way that's uh uh evocative of life

3834
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:07,000
in a way that's uh uh evocative of life
 

3835
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,110
in a way that's uh uh evocative of life
is is pretty exciting so the Elegance of

3836
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
is is pretty exciting so the Elegance of
 

3837
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,950
is is pretty exciting so the Elegance of
movement yeah or or if it's a high

3838
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:10,960
movement yeah or or if it's a high
 

3839
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,709
movement yeah or or if it's a high
performance act where it's doing it you

3840
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:12,719
performance act where it's doing it you
 

3841
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:15,590
performance act where it's doing it you
know faster bigger than uh than other

3842
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:15,600
know faster bigger than uh than other
 

3843
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,430
know faster bigger than uh than other
robots usually we're not doing it bigger

3844
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:17,440
robots usually we're not doing it bigger
 

3845
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,030
robots usually we're not doing it bigger
faster than people but you know we're

3846
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:19,040
faster than people but you know we're
 

3847
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,030
faster than people but you know we're
getting there in a few narrow Dimensions

3848
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:22,040
getting there in a few narrow Dimensions
 

3849
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,430
getting there in a few narrow Dimensions
so fast are bigger

3850
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:24,440
so fast are bigger
 

3851
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,669
so fast are bigger
smoother more elegant more graceful I

3852
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:27,679
smoother more elegant more graceful I
 

3853
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,470
smoother more elegant more graceful I
mean I'd like to do dancing that that

3854
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:29,480
mean I'd like to do dancing that that
 

3855
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:32,310
mean I'd like to do dancing that that
starts you know we're nowhere near the

3856
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:32,320
starts you know we're nowhere near the
 

3857
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,510
starts you know we're nowhere near the
uh the dancing capabilities of a human

3858
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:34,520
uh the dancing capabilities of a human
 

3859
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,750
uh the dancing capabilities of a human
we we've been having a ballerina in

3860
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:36,760
we we've been having a ballerina in
 

3861
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,510
we we've been having a ballerina in
who's uh kind of a well-known ballerina

3862
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:39,520
who's uh kind of a well-known ballerina
 

3863
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,870
who's uh kind of a well-known ballerina
and she's been programming uh the robot

3864
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:41,880
and she's been programming uh the robot
 

3865
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:43,430
and she's been programming uh the robot
we've been working on the tools that can

3866
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
we've been working on the tools that can
 

3867
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,149
we've been working on the tools that can
make it so that she can use her way of

3868
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:46,159
make it so that she can use her way of
 

3869
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,709
make it so that she can use her way of
talking uh you know way of doing a

3870
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719
talking uh you know way of doing a
 

3871
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,070
talking uh you know way of doing a
choreography or something like that more

3872
01:17:51,070 --> 01:17:51,080
choreography or something like that more
 

3873
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,189
choreography or something like that more
accessible uh to uh to get the robot do

3874
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
accessible uh to uh to get the robot do
 

3875
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:56,990
accessible uh to uh to get the robot do
things and starting to produce some

3876
01:17:56,990 --> 01:17:57,000
things and starting to produce some
 

3877
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,950
things and starting to produce some
interesting stuff well we should mention

3878
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:58,960
interesting stuff well we should mention
 

3879
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,270
interesting stuff well we should mention
that there is a choreography tool there

3880
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:01,280
that there is a choreography tool there
 

3881
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:04,669
that there is a choreography tool there
is I I mean I I guess I saw versions of

3882
01:18:04,669 --> 01:18:04,679
is I I mean I I guess I saw versions of
 

3883
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:07,709
is I I mean I I guess I saw versions of
it uh which is pretty cool you can kind

3884
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:07,719
it uh which is pretty cool you can kind
 

3885
01:18:07,719 --> 01:18:10,910
it uh which is pretty cool you can kind
of at at slices of time control

3886
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:10,920
of at at slices of time control
 

3887
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:13,229
of at at slices of time control
different parts at the high level the

3888
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:13,239
different parts at the high level the
 

3889
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:15,430
different parts at the high level the
movement of the robot spot we hope to

3890
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440
movement of the robot spot we hope to
 

3891
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,390
movement of the robot spot we hope to
take that forward and make it you know

3892
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:17,400
take that forward and make it you know
 

3893
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,470
take that forward and make it you know
more tuned to how uh the Dance World

3894
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:20,480
more tuned to how uh the Dance World
 

3895
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:23,510
more tuned to how uh the Dance World
wants to talk wants to communicate and

3896
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:23,520
wants to talk wants to communicate and
 

3897
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,229
wants to talk wants to communicate and
and get better performances I mean we've

3898
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:26,239
and get better performances I mean we've
 

3899
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:27,750
and get better performances I mean we've
done done a lot but there's still a lot

3900
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:27,760
done done a lot but there's still a lot
 

3901
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,990
done done a lot but there's still a lot
possible and I'd like to have

3902
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,000
possible and I'd like to have
 

3903
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,750
possible and I'd like to have
performances where the robots are

3904
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:31,760
performances where the robots are
 

3905
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:34,590
performances where the robots are
dancing with people so right now almost

3906
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:34,600
dancing with people so right now almost
 

3907
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:37,669
dancing with people so right now almost
everything that we've done on Dancing uh

3908
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:37,679
everything that we've done on Dancing uh
 

3909
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,790
everything that we've done on Dancing uh
is to a fixed time base so once you

3910
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:40,800
is to a fixed time base so once you
 

3911
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,629
is to a fixed time base so once you
press go the robot does its thing and

3912
01:18:42,629 --> 01:18:42,639
press go the robot does its thing and
 

3913
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:45,030
press go the robot does its thing and
plays out its thing it's not listening

3914
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:45,040
plays out its thing it's not listening
 

3915
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,830
plays out its thing it's not listening
it's not watching but I think it should

3916
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:47,840
it's not watching but I think it should
 

3917
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,229
it's not watching but I think it should
do those things I think I would love to

3918
01:18:50,229 --> 01:18:50,239
do those things I think I would love to
 

3919
01:18:50,239 --> 01:18:53,669
do those things I think I would love to
see a professional ballerina like alone

3920
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:53,679
see a professional ballerina like alone
 

3921
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:55,669
see a professional ballerina like alone
in a room with a robot slowly teaching

3922
01:18:55,669 --> 01:18:55,679
in a room with a robot slowly teaching
 

3923
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:57,990
in a room with a robot slowly teaching
the robot just actually the the process

3924
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,000
the robot just actually the the process
 

3925
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,229
the robot just actually the the process
of a clueless robot trying to figure out

3926
01:19:01,229 --> 01:19:01,239
of a clueless robot trying to figure out
 

3927
01:19:01,239 --> 01:19:03,950
of a clueless robot trying to figure out
a small little piece of a dance so it's

3928
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:03,960
a small little piece of a dance so it's
 

3929
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,110
a small little piece of a dance so it's
not like because right now Atlas and

3930
01:19:06,110 --> 01:19:06,120
not like because right now Atlas and
 

3931
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,669
not like because right now Atlas and
spot have done like perfect dancing

3932
01:19:08,669 --> 01:19:08,679
spot have done like perfect dancing
 

3933
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:11,510
spot have done like perfect dancing
right uh to a beat and so on well so you

3934
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,520
right uh to a beat and so on well so you
 

3935
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,870
right uh to a beat and so on well so you
know uh to a degree but like the

3936
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:13,880
know uh to a degree but like the
 

3937
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,070
know uh to a degree but like the
learning

3938
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:15,080
learning
 

3939
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,390
learning
process of interacting with a human

3940
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:17,400
process of interacting with a human
 

3941
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,629
process of interacting with a human
would be like incredible to watch one of

3942
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:19,639
would be like incredible to watch one of
 

3943
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:21,590
would be like incredible to watch one of
the cool things going on you know that

3944
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:21,600
the cool things going on you know that
 

3945
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,750
the cool things going on you know that
there's a class at Brown university

3946
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
there's a class at Brown university
 

3947
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,709
there's a class at Brown university
called choreo robotics Sydney Sky better

3948
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
called choreo robotics Sydney Sky better
 

3949
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,189

is a Dancer uh choreographer and he he

3950
01:19:30,189 --> 01:19:30,199
is a Dancer uh choreographer and he he
 

3951
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:32,550

teamed up with Stephanie telx who's a

3952
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
teamed up with Stephanie telx who's a
 

3953
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,790
teamed up with Stephanie telx who's a
computer science professor and they

3954
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:34,800
computer science professor and they
 

3955
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,070
computer science professor and they
taught this class and I think they have

3956
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:36,080
taught this class and I think they have
 

3957
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,870
taught this class and I think they have
some uh graduate students help him teach

3958
01:19:37,870 --> 01:19:37,880
some uh graduate students help him teach
 

3959
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,709
some uh graduate students help him teach
it where they have two spots and people

3960
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:40,719
it where they have two spots and people
 

3961
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,669
it where they have two spots and people
come in most uh I think it's 5050 of uh

and uh they do they program performances
 

3967
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,709
and uh they do they program performances
that are that are very interesting I

3968
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:50,719
that are that are very interesting I
 

3969
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:51,990
that are that are very interesting I
show some of them sometimes when I give

3970
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,000
show some of them sometimes when I give
 

3971
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,390
show some of them sometimes when I give
a talk and making that process of a

part
movement that'd be fascinating that'd be

3980
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:01,880
movement that'd be fascinating that'd be
 

3981
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:03,870
movement that'd be fascinating that'd be
really fascinating because I I mean one

3982
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:03,880
really fascinating because I I mean one
 

3983
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,110
really fascinating because I I mean one
of the things I've kind of realized is

3984
01:20:06,110 --> 01:20:06,120
of the things I've kind of realized is
 

3985
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,669
of the things I've kind of realized is
um humans communicate with

3986
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
um humans communicate with
 

3987
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,629
um humans communicate with
movement a lot it's not just language

3988
01:20:12,629 --> 01:20:12,639
movement a lot it's not just language
 

3989
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:14,149
movement a lot it's not just language
there's a lot there's body language

3990
01:20:14,149 --> 01:20:14,159
there's a lot there's body language
 

3991
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:16,030
there's a lot there's body language
there's so many intricate little things

3992
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:16,040
there's so many intricate little things
 

3993
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:20,390
there's so many intricate little things
and totally and like that you know to to

3994
01:20:20,390 --> 01:20:20,400
and totally and like that you know to to
 

3995
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,950
and totally and like that you know to to
watch a human and spot communicate get

3996
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:22,960
watch a human and spot communicate get
 

3997
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,629
watch a human and spot communicate get
back and forth with movement is uh I

3998
01:20:25,629 --> 01:20:25,639
back and forth with movement is uh I
 

3999
01:20:25,639 --> 01:20:26,830
back and forth with movement is uh I
mean there's so many wonderful

4000
01:20:26,830 --> 01:20:26,840
mean there's so many wonderful
 

4001
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,350
mean there's so many wonderful
possibilities there but it's also a

4002
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,360
possibilities there but it's also a
 

4003
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:33,430
possibilities there but it's also a
challenge you know we we get asked to

4004
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
challenge you know we we get asked to
 

4005
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,910
challenge you know we we get asked to
have our robots perform with uh with

4006
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
have our robots perform with uh with
 

4007
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:40,070
have our robots perform with uh with
famous dancers and they can you know

4008
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,080
famous dancers and they can you know
 

4009
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,030
famous dancers and they can you know
they have 200 degrees of freedom or

4010
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:42,040
they have 200 degrees of freedom or
 

4011
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,430
they have 200 degrees of freedom or
something right every little Ripple and

4012
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:44,440
something right every little Ripple and
 

4013
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:45,790
something right every little Ripple and
thing and they have all this head and

4014
01:20:45,790 --> 01:20:45,800
thing and they have all this head and
 

4015
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,870
thing and they have all this head and
neck and shoulders and stuff and the

4016
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:47,880
neck and shoulders and stuff and the
 

4017
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,149
neck and shoulders and stuff and the
robots mostly don't have all that stuff

4018
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:50,159
robots mostly don't have all that stuff
 

4019
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,790
robots mostly don't have all that stuff
and it's it's a it's a daunting

4020
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:52,800
and it's it's a it's a daunting
 

4021
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,510
and it's it's a it's a daunting
challenge to not look stupid you know

4022
01:20:56,510 --> 01:20:56,520
challenge to not look stupid you know
 

4023
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,430
challenge to not look stupid you know
physically stupid next to them so we've

4024
01:20:59,430 --> 01:20:59,440
physically stupid next to them so we've
 

4025
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,149
physically stupid next to them so we've
we've pretty much avoided that kind of

4026
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:01,159
we've pretty much avoided that kind of
 

4027
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:04,149
we've pretty much avoided that kind of
performance but we'll we'll get to it I

4028
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:04,159
performance but we'll we'll get to it I
 

4029
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,629
performance but we'll we'll get to it I
think even with the limited degrees of

4030
01:21:05,629 --> 01:21:05,639
think even with the limited degrees of
 

4031
01:21:05,639 --> 01:21:07,470
think even with the limited degrees of
freedom we could still have some SASS

4032
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:07,480
freedom we could still have some SASS
 

4033
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,950
freedom we could still have some SASS
and flavor and so on you can figure out

4034
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:09,960
and flavor and so on you can figure out
 

4035
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,990
and flavor and so on you can figure out
your own thing even if you can't and we

4036
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:12,000
your own thing even if you can't and we
 

4037
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,229
your own thing even if you can't and we
can reverse things like if you watch a

4038
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:14,239
can reverse things like if you watch a
 

4039
01:21:14,239 --> 01:21:16,669
can reverse things like if you watch a
human do uh robot animation which is a

4040
01:21:16,669 --> 01:21:16,679
human do uh robot animation which is a
 

4041
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:18,430
human do uh robot animation which is a
dance style where you know you jerk

4042
01:21:18,430 --> 01:21:18,440
dance style where you know you jerk
 

4043
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,870
dance style where you know you jerk
around sort of and you po you pop and

4044
01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:20,880
around sort of and you po you pop and
 

4045
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,229
around sort of and you po you pop and
pop and lock and all that stuff I think

4046
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:23,239
pop and lock and all that stuff I think
 

4047
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:25,870
pop and lock and all that stuff I think
the robots could show up the D the

4048
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:25,880
the robots could show up the D the
 

4049
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,910
the robots could show up the D the
humans by uh you know doing unstable

4050
01:21:28,910 --> 01:21:28,920
humans by uh you know doing unstable
 

4051
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,189
humans by uh you know doing unstable
oscillations and things that are faster

4052
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
oscillations and things that are faster
 

4053
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:33,950
oscillations and things that are faster
than a person so that's sort of on my

4054
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:33,960
than a person so that's sort of on my
 

4055
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:37,510
than a person so that's sort of on my
you know my plan but we haven't quite

4056
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:37,520
you know my plan but we haven't quite
 

4057
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,950
you know my plan but we haven't quite
gotten there yet you you mentioned about

4058
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:39,960
gotten there yet you you mentioned about
 

4059
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,709
gotten there yet you you mentioned about
building teams and Robotics teams and so

4060
01:21:41,709 --> 01:21:41,719
building teams and Robotics teams and so
 

4061
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:43,430
building teams and Robotics teams and so
on how do you how do you find great

4062
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:43,440
on how do you how do you find great
 

4063
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:45,950
on how do you how do you find great
Engineers how do you hire gr Engineers I

4064
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:45,960
Engineers how do you hire gr Engineers I
 

4065
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,550
Engineers how do you hire gr Engineers I
think you need to have an environment

4066
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:47,560
think you need to have an environment
 

4067
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,350
think you need to have an environment
where interesting engineer well you know

4068
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:49,360
where interesting engineer well you know
 

4069
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:50,550
where interesting engineer well you know
it's a chicken and egg if you have an

4070
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:50,560
it's a chicken and egg if you have an
 

4071
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,590
it's a chicken and egg if you have an
environment where interesting

4072
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
environment where interesting
 

4073
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,550
environment where interesting
engineering is going on on then

4074
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:53,560
engineering is going on on then
 

4075
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,750
engineering is going on on then
Engineers want to work there and

4076
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:56,760
Engineers want to work there and
 

4077
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,550
Engineers want to work there and
uh uh you know I think it took a long

4078
01:21:59,550 --> 01:21:59,560
uh uh you know I think it took a long
 

4079
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:01,709
uh uh you know I think it took a long
time to develop that at Boston Dynamics

4080
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:01,719
time to develop that at Boston Dynamics
 

4081
01:22:01,719 --> 01:22:05,550
time to develop that at Boston Dynamics
in fact when we started uh although you

4082
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:05,560
in fact when we started uh although you
 

4083
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:06,950
in fact when we started uh although you
know I had the experience of building

4084
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
know I had the experience of building
 

4085
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,830
know I had the experience of building
things in the in the my in the leg lab

4086
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:08,840
things in the in the my in the leg lab
 

4087
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,149
things in the in the my in the leg lab
both at CMU and at MIT uh we weren't

4088
01:22:12,149 --> 01:22:12,159
both at CMU and at MIT uh we weren't
 

4089
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:15,189
both at CMU and at MIT uh we weren't
that sophisticated of uh an engineering

4090
01:22:15,189 --> 01:22:15,199
that sophisticated of uh an engineering
 

4091
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,390
that sophisticated of uh an engineering
thing compared to what Boston lamics is

4092
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:17,400
thing compared to what Boston lamics is
 

4093
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:20,149
thing compared to what Boston lamics is
now uh but it was our ambition to do

4094
01:22:20,149 --> 01:22:20,159
now uh but it was our ambition to do
 

4095
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,790
now uh but it was our ambition to do
that and you know Saros was another

4096
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:22,800
that and you know Saros was another
 

4097
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,270
that and you know Saros was another
robot company so I always thought of us

4098
01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:25,280
robot company so I always thought of us
 

4099
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,750
robot company so I always thought of us
as being uh this much on the Computing

4100
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:28,760
as being uh this much on the Computing
 

4101
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,390
as being uh this much on the Computing
side and this much on the hardware side

4102
01:22:31,390 --> 01:22:31,400
side and this much on the hardware side
 

4103
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,430
side and this much on the hardware side
and they were like this uh and then over

4104
01:22:34,430 --> 01:22:34,440
and they were like this uh and then over
 

4105
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,430
and they were like this uh and then over
the years we you know I think we

4106
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:36,440
the years we you know I think we
 

4107
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:39,910
the years we you know I think we
achieved the same or better uh levels of

4108
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:39,920
achieved the same or better uh levels of
 

4109
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,310
achieved the same or better uh levels of
engineering meanwhile you know sarov got

4110
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:42,320
engineering meanwhile you know sarov got
 

4111
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,189
engineering meanwhile you know sarov got
Acquired and then they went through all

4112
01:22:44,189 --> 01:22:44,199
Acquired and then they went through all
 

4113
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:46,390
Acquired and then they went through all
kinds of changes and uh I don't know

4114
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,400
kinds of changes and uh I don't know
 

4115
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,070
kinds of changes and uh I don't know
exactly what their current status is but

4116
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:49,080
exactly what their current status is but
 

4117
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,510
exactly what their current status is but
uh so it took it took many years is is

4118
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:51,520
uh so it took it took many years is is
 

4119
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,270
uh so it took it took many years is is
part of the answer m

4120
01:22:53,270 --> 01:22:53,280
part of the answer m
 

4121
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,910
part of the answer m
uh I think you get you got to find

4122
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:54,920
uh I think you get you got to find
 

4123
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:57,030
uh I think you get you got to find
people who love it in the early days we

4124
01:22:57,030 --> 01:22:57,040
people who love it in the early days we
 

4125
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,590
people who love it in the early days we
would we paid a little less so we only

4126
01:22:59,590 --> 01:22:59,600
would we paid a little less so we only
 

4127
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,629
would we paid a little less so we only
got people who were doing it because

4128
01:23:01,629 --> 01:23:01,639
got people who were doing it because
 

4129
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:03,550
got people who were doing it because
because they really loved it we also

4130
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:03,560
because they really loved it we also
 

4131
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:05,750
because they really loved it we also
hired people who might not have

4132
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:05,760
hired people who might not have
 

4133
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,390
hired people who might not have
professional degrees you know people who

4134
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:07,400
professional degrees you know people who
 

4135
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,270
professional degrees you know people who
were building bicycles and uh building

4136
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:10,280
were building bicycles and uh building
 

4137
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:12,510
were building bicycles and uh building
kayaks we have some people who come from

4138
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:12,520
kayaks we have some people who come from
 

4139
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:14,870
kayaks we have some people who come from
that M kind of the maker world and

4140
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
that M kind of the maker world and
 

4141
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,430
that M kind of the maker world and
that's really important uh uh for the

4142
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:17,440
that's really important uh uh for the
 

4143
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,189
that's really important uh uh for the
kind of work we do to have that be part

4144
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
kind of work we do to have that be part
 

4145
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,990
kind of work we do to have that be part
of the mix whatever that is the whatever

4146
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:22,000
of the mix whatever that is the whatever
 

4147
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,830
of the mix whatever that is the whatever
the magic ingredient that makes a great

4148
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:23,840
the magic ingredient that makes a great
 

4149
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,430
the magic ingredient that makes a great
Builder maker that that that's the big

4150
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:26,440
Builder maker that that that's the big
 

4151
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,110
Builder maker that that that's the big
part of it people who took who repaired

4152
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:28,120
part of it people who took who repaired
 

4153
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,590
part of it people who took who repaired
the car the cars or uh built or

4154
01:23:30,590 --> 01:23:30,600
the car the cars or uh built or
 

4155
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:32,830
the car the cars or uh built or
motorcycles or whatever in their garages

motorcycles or whatever in their garages
 

4157
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,870
motorcycles or whatever in their garages
when they were kids there's a kind of

4158
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:34,880
when they were kids there's a kind of
 

4159
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,629
when they were kids there's a kind of
like the robotics students grass

4160
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:36,639
like the robotics students grass
 

4161
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:38,709
like the robotics students grass
students and just roboticist that uh I

4162
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:38,719
students and just roboticist that uh I
 

4163
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:42,709
students and just roboticist that uh I
know and hang out with there's a kind of

4164
01:23:42,709 --> 01:23:42,719
know and hang out with there's a kind of
 

4165
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,590
know and hang out with there's a kind of
endless energy and like there're just

4166
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:45,600
endless energy and like there're just
 

4167
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,590
endless energy and like there're just
they're just happy like say uh I compare

4168
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:48,600
they're just happy like say uh I compare
 

4169
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:49,950
they're just happy like say uh I compare
it another group of people that are like

4170
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:49,960
it another group of people that are like
 

4171
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,470
it another group of people that are like
that are people that Skydive

4172
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:51,480
that are people that Skydive
 

4173
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,669
that are people that Skydive
professionally there's just like a

4174
01:23:53,669 --> 01:23:53,679
professionally there's just like a
 

4175
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:56,669
professionally there's just like a
excitement in general energy that I

4176
01:23:56,669 --> 01:23:56,679
excitement in general energy that I
 

4177
01:23:56,679 --> 01:23:58,270
excitement in general energy that I
think probably has to do with the fact

4178
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:58,280
think probably has to do with the fact
 

4179
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,510
think probably has to do with the fact
that they're just

4180
01:23:59,510 --> 01:23:59,520
that they're just
 

4181
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:02,590
that they're just
constantly first of all fail a lot and

4182
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:02,600
constantly first of all fail a lot and
 

4183
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,870
constantly first of all fail a lot and
then the the joy of building a thing

4184
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:04,880
then the the joy of building a thing
 

4185
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,030
then the the joy of building a thing
that you eventually works yeah talk

4186
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:07,040
that you eventually works yeah talk
 

4187
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,229
that you eventually works yeah talk
about being happy they used to be a time

4188
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:09,239
about being happy they used to be a time
 

4189
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:10,910
about being happy they used to be a time
when when I was doing the Machine Shop

4190
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:10,920
when when I was doing the Machine Shop
 

4191
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:13,390
when when I was doing the Machine Shop
work myself back in those JPL and

4192
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:13,400
work myself back in those JPL and
 

4193
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,390
work myself back in those JPL and
Caltech days when if I came home

4194

Caltech days when if I came home
 

4195
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,910
Caltech days when if I came home
smelling like the Machine Shop you know

4196

what he did with Tesla was just totally
 

4279
01:25:57,159 --> 01:25:59,470
what he did with Tesla was just totally
mindboggling that he could go from this

what uh what he's done so you got to
 

4293
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,669
what uh what he's done so you got to
give it to him then look at SpaceX you

4294
01:26:16,669 --> 01:26:16,679
give it to him then look at SpaceX you
 

4295
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:19,950
give it to him then look at SpaceX you
know he's basically replaced NASA if you

4296
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:19,960
know he's basically replaced NASA if you
 

4297
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,390
know he's basically replaced NASA if you
could that might be a little

4298

exaggeration but not by much um so you
 

4301
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:27,629
exaggeration but not by much um so you
know you got to admire the guy and uh

know you got to admire the guy and uh
 

4303
01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:29,390
know you got to admire the guy and uh
you know I wouldn't count him out for

4304
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:29,400
you know I wouldn't count him out for
 

4305
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,990
you know I wouldn't count him out for
for anything you know I don't think uh

4317
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,590
figure I think they're doing well and
they have a good team

4318
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:48,600
they have a good team
 

4319
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,430
they have a good team
uh I've visited EP tronic and I think

4320
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:51,440
uh I've visited EP tronic and I think
 

4321
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,790
uh I've visited EP tronic and I think
they're they haven't a good team and

4322
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:52,800
they're they haven't a good team and
 

4323
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,430
they're they haven't a good team and
they're doing well uh but Elon has a lot

4324
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:56,440
they're doing well uh but Elon has a lot
 

4325
01:26:56,440 --> 01:26:57,109
they're doing well uh but Elon has a lot
of

4326
01:26:57,109 --> 01:26:57,119
of
 

4327
01:26:57,119 --> 01:26:59,910
of
resources he has a lot of

4328
01:26:59,910 --> 01:26:59,920
resources he has a lot of
 

4329
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,430
resources he has a lot of
ambition i' like to take some credit for

4330
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:02,440
ambition i' like to take some credit for
 

4331
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,470
ambition i' like to take some credit for
his ambition I think uh I think if I

4332
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:05,480
his ambition I think uh I think if I
 

4333
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,790
his ambition I think uh I think if I
read between the lines it's hard not to

4334
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:07,800
read between the lines it's hard not to
 

4335
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,950
read between the lines it's hard not to
think that uh him seeing what Atlas is

4336
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:09,960
think that uh him seeing what Atlas is
 

4337
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,709
think that uh him seeing what Atlas is
doing is a little bit of an inspiration

4338
01:27:11,709 --> 01:27:11,719
doing is a little bit of an inspiration
 

4339
01:27:11,719 --> 01:27:14,149
doing is a little bit of an inspiration
I I hope so do you think Atlas and

4340
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:14,159
I I hope so do you think Atlas and
 

4341
01:27:14,159 --> 01:27:16,910
I I hope so do you think Atlas and
Optimus will will hang out at some point

this like robot playground you've built

4394
01:28:17,229 --> 01:28:17,239
this like robot playground you've built
 

4395
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:18,629
this like robot playground you've built
yeah you can come over and take a look

4396
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:18,639
yeah you can come over and take a look
 

4397

yeah you can come over and take a look
if you want that's great so it's like

4398

if you want that's great so it's like
 

4399
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,390
if you want that's great so it's like
all these kinds of robots legged arms it

4400
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:23,400
all these kinds of robots legged arms it
 

4401
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:24,950
all these kinds of robots legged arms it
doesn't feel that much like well there's

4402
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:24,960
doesn't feel that much like well there's
 

4403
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,550
doesn't feel that much like well there's
some areas that feel like a playground

4404
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:26,560
some areas that feel like a playground
 

4405
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:30,030
some areas that feel like a playground
but it's not like they're all Frolic

4406
01:28:30,030 --> 01:28:30,040
but it's not like they're all Frolic
 

4407
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:33,070
but it's not like they're all Frolic
together hey again maybe you'll arrange

4408
01:28:33,070 --> 01:28:33,080
together hey again maybe you'll arrange
 

4409
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:37,430
together hey again maybe you'll arrange
it uh a robot Meetup um but in general

4410
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:37,440
it uh a robot Meetup um but in general
 

4411
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:39,350
it uh a robot Meetup um but in general
what's your view on competition in the

4412
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:39,360
what's your view on competition in the
 

4413
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,990
what's your view on competition in the
space for especially like humanoid and

4414
01:28:40,990 --> 01:28:41,000
space for especially like humanoid and
 

4415
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,189
space for especially like humanoid and
leg of robots are you are you excited by

4416
01:28:44,189 --> 01:28:44,199
leg of robots are you are you excited by
 

4417
01:28:44,199 --> 01:28:46,709
leg of robots are you are you excited by
the competition or the the friendly

4418

doesn't you know I don't think I don't
think about competition that much uh you

4424
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:54,880
think about competition that much uh you
 

4425
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,070
think about competition that much uh you
know I'm not a commercial guy uh I think

know I'm not a commercial guy uh I think
 

4427
01:28:57,080 --> 01:28:58,750
know I'm not a commercial guy uh I think
for many years at Boston you know the

4428
01:28:58,750 --> 01:28:58,760
for many years at Boston you know the
 

4429
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,550
for many years at Boston you know the
many years I was at Boston Dynamics we

4430
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:01,560
many years I was at Boston Dynamics we
 

4431
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,870
many years I was at Boston Dynamics we
we didn't think about competition we

4432
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:02,880
we didn't think about competition we
 

4433
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,470
we didn't think about competition we
were just kind of doing our thing there

4434
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:04,480
were just kind of doing our thing there
 

4435
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,390
were just kind of doing our thing there
wasn't it wasn't like there were

products out there that we were
 

4439
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:09,590
products out there that we were
competing no you know maybe there was

competing no you know maybe there was
 

4441
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,669
competing no you know maybe there was
some competition for DARPA funding which

4442
01:29:12,669 --> 01:29:12,679
some competition for DARPA funding which
 

4443
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:14,390
some competition for DARPA funding which
we got you know got a lot of got very

4444
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,400
we got you know got a lot of got very
 

4445

good at at getting but even there uh in
 

4447
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,189
good at at getting but even there uh in
in a couple of cases where we might have

4448
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:21,199
in a couple of cases where we might have
 

4449
01:29:21,199 --> 01:29:22,990
in a couple of cases where we might have
competed we ended up just being the

4450
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:23,000
competed we ended up just being the
 

4451
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,270
competed we ended up just being the
robot provider that is for the little

4452
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:25,280
robot provider that is for the little
 

4453
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:28,189
robot provider that is for the little
dog program you know we we just made the

4454
01:29:28,189 --> 01:29:28,199
dog program you know we we just made the
 

4455
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:29,790
dog program you know we we just made the
robots we didn't participate as

4456
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:29,800
robots we didn't participate as
 

4457
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,750

challenge we didn't compete we uh
 

4463
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:42,430
challenge we didn't compete we uh
provided the robots so uh uh you know in

4464
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:42,440
provided the robots so uh uh you know in
 

4465
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,270
provided the robots so uh uh you know in
the AI world now now that we're working

4466
01:29:44,270 --> 01:29:44,280
the AI world now now that we're working
 

4467
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,310
the AI world now now that we're working
on cognitive stuff it feels much more

4468
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:46,320
on cognitive stuff it feels much more
 

4469
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:50,070
on cognitive stuff it feels much more
like a a competition you know the the

4470
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:50,080
like a a competition you know the the
 

4471
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,910
like a a competition you know the the
entry uh requirement ments in terms of

4472
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:52,920
entry uh requirement ments in terms of
 

4473
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:56,350
entry uh requirement ments in terms of
computing hardware and uh and the skills

4474
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:56,360
computing hardware and uh and the skills
 

4475
01:29:56,360 --> 01:30:00,070
computing hardware and uh and the skills
of the team are and and hiring Talent

4476
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:00,080
of the team are and and hiring Talent
 

4477

it's it's a much tougher place so I

4478
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
it's it's a much tougher place so I
 

4479
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:04,910
it's it's a much tougher place so I
think much more about competition now on

4480
01:30:04,910 --> 01:30:04,920
think much more about competition now on
 

4481
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,470
think much more about competition now on
the cognitive side on the physical side

4482
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:07,480
the cognitive side on the physical side
 

4483
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,350
the cognitive side on the physical side
it doesn't feel like it's that much

4484
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,360
it doesn't feel like it's that much
 

4485
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,709
it doesn't feel like it's that much
about competition yet obviously with 10

4486
01:30:11,709 --> 01:30:11,719
about competition yet obviously with 10
 

4487
01:30:11,719 --> 01:30:14,229
about competition yet obviously with 10
humanoid companies out there 10 or 12 I

4488
01:30:14,229 --> 01:30:14,239
humanoid companies out there 10 or 12 I
 

4489
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:15,350
humanoid companies out there 10 or 12 I
mean there's probably others that I

4490
01:30:15,350 --> 01:30:15,360
mean there's probably others that I
 

4491
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:19,629
mean there's probably others that I
don't know about um they're definitely

4492
01:30:19,629 --> 01:30:19,639
don't know about um they're definitely
 

4493
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:22,070
don't know about um they're definitely
in competition will be in competition

4494
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:22,080
in competition will be in competition
 

4495

how much room is there

4496
01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:24,360
how much room is there
 

4497
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:27,390
how much room is there
for a quadruped and especially a

4498

humanoid robot to become cheaper so like
 

4501
01:30:31,239 --> 01:30:35,709
humanoid robot to become cheaper so like
cutting cost and like how low can you

4502
01:30:35,709 --> 01:30:35,719
cutting cost and like how low can you
 

4503
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:38,310
cutting cost and like how low can you
go and how much of it is just mass

4504
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:38,320
go and how much of it is just mass
 

4505
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,350

other people selling quadrupeds is a
 

4531
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,350

the question I believe the question in
 

4535
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,149
the question I believe the question in
the users Minds is which quadruped do I

4536
01:31:17,149 --> 01:31:17,159
the users Minds is which quadruped do I
 

4537
01:31:17,159 --> 01:31:19,510

uh it's much more like that which is a a
great place for it to be yeah then then

4544
01:31:26,229 --> 01:31:26,239
great place for it to be yeah then then
 

4545
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,070

you're just you know doing doing the

4546
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:29,080
you're just you know doing doing the
 

4547
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,510
you're just you know doing doing the
things you normally do to make your

4548
01:31:30,510 --> 01:31:30,520
things you normally do to make your
 

4549
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,750
things you normally do to make your
product better and compete and sell

4550
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:32,760
product better and compete and sell
 

4551
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,109
product better and compete and sell
selling and all that stuff and that'll

4552
01:31:35,109 --> 01:31:35,119
selling and all that stuff and that'll
 

4553
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:36,550
selling and all that stuff and that'll
be the way it is with humanoids at some

4554
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:36,560
be the way it is with humanoids at some
 

4555
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,390
be the way it is with humanoids at some
point well there's a lot of humanoids

4556
01:31:38,390 --> 01:31:38,400
point well there's a lot of humanoids
 

4557
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,669
point well there's a lot of humanoids
and you're just not even it's like

4558
01:31:41,669 --> 01:31:41,679
and you're just not even it's like
 

4559
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,590
and you're just not even it's like
uh iPhone versus Android and people just

4560
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:44,600
uh iPhone versus Android and people just
 

4561
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,350
uh iPhone versus Android and people just
buying both and it's kind of just yeah

4562
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:47,360
buying both and it's kind of just yeah
 

4563
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,430
buying both and it's kind of just yeah
uh you're not really you're creating the

4564
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:49,440
uh you're not really you're creating the
 

4565
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,430
uh you're not really you're creating the
category you or the category is

4566
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,440
category you or the category is
 

4567
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,590
category you or the category is
happening

4568
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:52,600
happening
 

4569
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,310
happening
I mean right now the use cases you know

4570
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:55,320
I mean right now the use cases you know
 

4571
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,350
I mean right now the use cases you know
that that's the the key thing having

4572
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:57,360
that that's the the key thing having
 

4573
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,070
that that's the the key thing having
realistic use cases that are money

4574
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,080
realistic use cases that are money
 

4575
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,030
realistic use cases that are money
making uh in robotics is is a big

4576
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,040
making uh in robotics is is a big
 

4577
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:04,390
making uh in robotics is is a big
challenge you know there's the warehouse

4578
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:04,400
challenge you know there's the warehouse
 

4579
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,510
challenge you know there's the warehouse
use case that's probably the only thing

4580
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:06,520
use case that's probably the only thing
 

4581
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,910
use case that's probably the only thing
that makes anybody any money in robotics

4582
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:08,920
that makes anybody any money in robotics
 

4583
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:11,270
that makes anybody any money in robotics
at this point there's got to be a moment

4584
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:11,280
at this point there's got to be a moment
 

4585
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:12,470
at this point there's got to be a moment
there's old fashioned robot I mean

4586
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:12,480
there's old fashioned robot I mean
 

4587
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,070
there's old fashioned robot I mean
there's AR fixed arms doing

4588
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:14,080
there's AR fixed arms doing
 

4589
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:16,070
there's AR fixed arms doing
manufacturing I don't want to yes say

4590
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,080
manufacturing I don't want to yes say
 

4591
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:17,990

that they're not making money industrial

4592
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
that they're not making money industrial
 

4593
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,390
that they're not making money industrial
robotics yes but I there's got to be a

4594
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:20,400
robotics yes but I there's got to be a
 

4595
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:21,910
robotics yes but I there's got to be a
moment when social robotics starts

4596
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:21,920
moment when social robotics starts
 

4597
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,510
moment when social robotics starts
making real money meaning like a spot

4598
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:24,520
making real money meaning like a spot
 

4599
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:27,270

4603
01:32:28,639 --> 01:32:30,229
of millions of them in the home and
they're like you know I don't know how

4604
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:30,239
they're like you know I don't know how
 

4605
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:31,870
they're like you know I don't know how
many dogs there are in the United States

4606
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:31,880
many dogs there are in the United States
 

4607
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:35,830
many dogs there are in the United States
as pets but this feels many it feels

4608
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:35,840
as pets but this feels many it feels
 

4609
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,030
as pets but this feels many it feels
like there's something we love about

4610
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:38,040
like there's something we love about
 

4611
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,790
like there's something we love about
having a intelligent companion with us

4612
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
having a intelligent companion with us
 

4613
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,550

that remembers us that's excited to see

4614
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:42,560
that remembers us that's excited to see
 

4615
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,669
that remembers us that's excited to see
us all that kind of stuff but it's also

4616
01:32:44,669 --> 01:32:44,679
us all that kind of stuff but it's also
 

4617
01:32:44,679 --> 01:32:46,790
us all that kind of stuff but it's also
true that the companies making those

4618
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:46,800
true that the companies making those
 

4619
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:47,629
true that the companies making those
things there' have been a lot of

4620
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:47,639
things there' have been a lot of
 

4621
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:49,709
things there' have been a lot of
failures in recent times right there's

4622
01:32:49,709 --> 01:32:49,719
failures in recent times right there's
 

4623
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:51,189
failures in recent times right there's
that one year when I think three of them

4624
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:51,199
that one year when I think three of them
 

4625
01:32:51,199 --> 01:32:52,709
that one year when I think three of them
went under

4626
01:32:52,709 --> 01:32:52,719
went under
 

4627
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:55,270
went under
um so it's it's not that easy to do that

4628
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:55,280
um so it's it's not that easy to do that
 

4629
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:58,910
um so it's it's not that easy to do that
right getting you know getting uh

4630
01:32:58,910 --> 01:32:58,920
right getting you know getting uh
 

4631
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:01,870
right getting you know getting uh
performance safety and cost all to be

4632
01:33:01,870 --> 01:33:01,880
performance safety and cost all to be
 

4633
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,109
performance safety and cost all to be
where they need to be at the same time

4634
01:33:04,109 --> 01:33:04,119
where they need to be at the same time
 

4635
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:07,830
where they need to be at the same time
is uh that's that's hard but also some

4636
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:07,840
is uh that's that's hard but also some
 

4637
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,709
is uh that's that's hard but also some
of it is like you said you can have a

4638
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:09,719
of it is like you said you can have a
 

4639
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:12,629
of it is like you said you can have a
product but uh people might not be aware

4640
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:12,639
product but uh people might not be aware
 

4641
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,430
product but uh people might not be aware
of it so like also part of it is the

4642
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:14,440
of it so like also part of it is the
 

4643
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,709
of it so like also part of it is the
videos or however you connect with the

4644
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:16,719
videos or however you connect with the
 

4645
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:19,590
videos or however you connect with the
public the the culture and like create

4646
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:19,600
public the the culture and like create
 

4647
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,669
public the the culture and like create
the category make make people realize

4648
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:21,679
the category make make people realize
 

4649
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,390
the category make make people realize
this is the thing you want cuz from a

4650
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:23,400
this is the thing you want cuz from a
 

4651
01:33:23,400 --> 01:33:24,550
this is the thing you want cuz from a
you know there's a lot of negative

4652
01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:24,560
you know there's a lot of negative
 

4653
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,189
you know there's a lot of negative
perceptions you can have do you really

4654
01:33:26,189 --> 01:33:26,199
perceptions you can have do you really
 

4655
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:29,109
perceptions you can have do you really
want a system with a camera in your home

4656
01:33:29,109 --> 01:33:29,119
want a system with a camera in your home
 

4657
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:33,229
want a system with a camera in your home
walking around right um if if it's

4658
01:33:33,229 --> 01:33:33,239
walking around right um if if it's
 

4659
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:35,149
walking around right um if if it's
presented correctly and if there's like

4660
01:33:35,149 --> 01:33:35,159
presented correctly and if there's like
 

4661
01:33:35,159 --> 01:33:36,629
presented correctly and if there's like
the right kind of boundaries around it

4662
01:33:36,629 --> 01:33:36,639
the right kind of boundaries around it
 

4663
01:33:36,639 --> 01:33:38,189
the right kind of boundaries around it
that you understand how it works and so

4664
01:33:38,189 --> 01:33:38,199
that you understand how it works and so
 

4665
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:40,669
that you understand how it works and so
on that uh a lot of people would want to

4666
01:33:40,669 --> 01:33:40,679
on that uh a lot of people would want to
 

4667
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:42,109
on that uh a lot of people would want to
and if they don't they might be

4668
01:33:42,109 --> 01:33:42,119
and if they don't they might be
 

4669
01:33:42,119 --> 01:33:44,590
and if they don't they might be
suspicious of it so that that's an

4670
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:44,600
suspicious of it so that that's an
 

4671
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,390
suspicious of it so that that's an
important like we all use smartphones

4672
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:46,400
important like we all use smartphones
 

4673
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:47,950
important like we all use smartphones
and that has a camera that's looking at

4674
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:47,960
and that has a camera that's looking at
 

4675
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,750
and that has a camera that's looking at
us yeah it has two or three or four and

4676
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:50,760
us yeah it has two or three or four and
 

4677
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:53,149
us yeah it has two or three or four and
it's listening is very few people are

4678
01:33:53,149 --> 01:33:53,159
it's listening is very few people are
 

4679
01:33:53,159 --> 01:33:56,189
it's listening is very few people are
are uh you know suspicious about it they

4680
01:33:56,189 --> 01:33:56,199
are uh you know suspicious about it they
 

4681
01:33:56,199 --> 01:33:57,870
are uh you know suspicious about it they
kind of take it for granted and so on

4682
01:33:57,870 --> 01:33:57,880
kind of take it for granted and so on
 

4683
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,149
kind of take it for granted and so on
and I think robots would be the same

4684
01:33:59,149 --> 01:33:59,159
and I think robots would be the same
 

4685
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:00,990
and I think robots would be the same
kind of way I I

4686
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:01,000
kind of way I I
 

4687
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,830
kind of way I I
agree so as you work on the cognitive

4688
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:03,840
agree so as you work on the cognitive
 

4689
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:07,030
agree so as you work on the cognitive
aspect of uh of these robots do you

4690
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:07,040
aspect of uh of these robots do you
 

4691
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:07,990
aspect of uh of these robots do you
think we'll

4692
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:08,000
think we'll
 

4693
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,669
think we'll
ever get to human level or superhuman

4694
01:34:10,669 --> 01:34:10,679
ever get to human level or superhuman
 

4695
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:12,109
ever get to human level or superhuman
level

4696
01:34:12,109 --> 01:34:12,119
level
 

4697
01:34:12,119 --> 01:34:13,830
level
intelligence there's been a lot of

4698
01:34:13,830 --> 01:34:13,840
intelligence there's been a lot of
 

4699
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:16,990
intelligence there's been a lot of
conversations about this recently given

4700
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:17,000
conversations about this recently given
 

4701
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,149
conversations about this recently given
the rapid development in large language

4702
01:34:20,149 --> 01:34:20,159
the rapid development in large language
 

4703
01:34:20,159 --> 01:34:23,229
the rapid development in large language
models um I I think that intelligence is

4704
01:34:23,229 --> 01:34:23,239
models um I I think that intelligence is
 

4705
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:26,030
models um I I think that intelligence is
a lot of different things and I think

4706
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:26,040
a lot of different things and I think
 

4707
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,510
a lot of different things and I think
some things computers are already

4708
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:27,520
some things computers are already
 

4709
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,550
some things computers are already
smarter than people and some things

4710
01:34:30,550 --> 01:34:30,560
smarter than people and some things
 

4711
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,470
smarter than people and some things
they're not even close and you know I

4712
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:33,480
they're not even close and you know I
 

4713
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:37,310
they're not even close and you know I
think you need a menu of of detailed

4714
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:37,320
think you need a menu of of detailed
 

4715
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:40,990
think you need a menu of of detailed
categories to come up with uh with that

4716
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:41,000
categories to come up with uh with that
 

4717
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,030
categories to come up with uh with that
but I also think that the you know the

4718
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:44,040
but I also think that the you know the
 

4719
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:45,990
but I also think that the you know the
the the conversation that seems to be

4720
01:34:45,990 --> 01:34:46,000
the the conversation that seems to be
 

4721
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,470
the the conversation that seems to be
happening about agis puzzles me it's

4722
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:49,480
happening about agis puzzles me it's
 

4723
01:34:49,480 --> 01:34:52,590
happening about agis puzzles me it's
sort of soorry ask you a question do you

4724
01:34:52,590 --> 01:34:52,600
sort of soorry ask you a question do you
 

4725
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,030
sort of soorry ask you a question do you
think there's anybody smarter than you

4726
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:54,040
think there's anybody smarter than you
 

4727
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,950
think there's anybody smarter than you
in the world AB absolutely yes does do

4728
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
in the world AB absolutely yes does do
 

4729
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:59,950
in the world AB absolutely yes does do
you find that threatening no so I don't

4730
01:34:59,950 --> 01:34:59,960
you find that threatening no so I don't
 

4731
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,750
you find that threatening no so I don't
understand even if computers were

4732
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:02,760
understand even if computers were
 

4733
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:05,229
understand even if computers were
smarter than people why we should assume

4734
01:35:05,229 --> 01:35:05,239
smarter than people why we should assume
 

4735
01:35:05,239 --> 01:35:09,030
smarter than people why we should assume
that that's a threat uh especially since

4736
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,040
that that's a threat uh especially since
 

4737
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,629
that that's a threat uh especially since
they could easily be smarter but still

4738
01:35:11,629 --> 01:35:11,639
they could easily be smarter but still
 

4739
01:35:11,639 --> 01:35:13,629
they could easily be smarter but still
available to us or under our control

4740
01:35:13,629 --> 01:35:13,639
available to us or under our control
 

4741
01:35:13,639 --> 01:35:15,629
available to us or under our control
which is basically how computers

4742
01:35:15,629 --> 01:35:15,639
which is basically how computers
 

4743
01:35:15,639 --> 01:35:19,870
which is basically how computers
generally are I think the the fears that

4744
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:19,880
generally are I think the the fears that
 

4745
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:25,149
generally are I think the the fears that
they would be 10x 100 act smarter and um

4746
01:35:25,149 --> 01:35:25,159
they would be 10x 100 act smarter and um
 

4747
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:27,430
they would be 10x 100 act smarter and um
operating under different morals and

4748
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:27,440
operating under different morals and
 

4749
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,510
operating under different morals and
ethical codes that humans like naturally

4750
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:29,520
ethical codes that humans like naturally
 

4751
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:32,590
ethical codes that humans like naturally
do and so almost become

4752
01:35:32,590 --> 01:35:32,600
do and so almost become
 

4753
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,669
do and so almost become
misaligned in uh unintended ways and

4754
01:35:35,669 --> 01:35:35,679
misaligned in uh unintended ways and
 

4755
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:38,669
misaligned in uh unintended ways and
therefore harm humans in ways we just

4756
01:35:38,669 --> 01:35:38,679
therefore harm humans in ways we just
 

4757
01:35:38,679 --> 01:35:41,790
therefore harm humans in ways we just
can't predict and uh even if we program

4758
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:41,800
can't predict and uh even if we program
 

4759
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:44,550
can't predict and uh even if we program
them to do a thing as on the way of

4760
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:44,560
them to do a thing as on the way of
 

4761
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,229
them to do a thing as on the way of
doing that thing they would cause a lot

4762
01:35:46,229 --> 01:35:46,239
doing that thing they would cause a lot
 

4763
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:48,709
doing that thing they would cause a lot
of harm and when they're 100 times a

4764
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:48,719
of harm and when they're 100 times a
 

4765
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:51,070
of harm and when they're 100 times a
thousand times 10,000 times smarter than

4766
01:35:51,070 --> 01:35:51,080
thousand times 10,000 times smarter than
 

4767
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,109
thousand times 10,000 times smarter than
us we won't be able to stop it or we

4768
01:35:53,109 --> 01:35:53,119
us we won't be able to stop it or we
 

4769
01:35:53,119 --> 01:35:54,709
us we won't be able to stop it or we
won't be able to even see the harm as

4770
01:35:54,709 --> 01:35:54,719
won't be able to even see the harm as
 

4771
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:56,990
won't be able to even see the harm as
it's happening until it's too late that

4772
01:35:56,990 --> 01:35:57,000
it's happening until it's too late that
 

4773
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,550
it's happening until it's too late that
kind of stuff so you can construct all

4774
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:58,560
kind of stuff so you can construct all
 

4775
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,229
kind of stuff so you can construct all
kinds of like possible trajectories of

4776
01:36:01,229 --> 01:36:01,239
kinds of like possible trajectories of
 

4777
01:36:01,239 --> 01:36:03,270
kinds of like possible trajectories of
how the world ends because of super

4778
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:03,280
how the world ends because of super
 

4779
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:04,430
how the world ends because of super
intelligent

4780
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:04,440
intelligent
 

4781
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:06,870
intelligent
systems it's a little bit like that line

4782
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:06,880
systems it's a little bit like that line
 

4783
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,310
systems it's a little bit like that line
in the Oppenheimer

4784
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,320
in the Oppenheimer
 

4785
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,830
in the Oppenheimer
movie uh where they contemplate whether

4786
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:11,840
movie uh where they contemplate whether
 

4787
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,270
movie uh where they contemplate whether
the first time they set off a reaction

4788
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:14,280
the first time they set off a reaction
 

4789
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:18,270
the first time they set off a reaction
all matter on Earth is going to uh you

4790
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:18,280
all matter on Earth is going to uh you
 

4791
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,750
all matter on Earth is going to uh you
know go go up I don't remember what the

4792
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:20,760
know go go up I don't remember what the
 

4793
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:24,070
know go go up I don't remember what the
the verb they used was for uh for it uh

4794
01:36:24,070 --> 01:36:24,080
the verb they used was for uh for it uh
 

4795
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:28,950
the verb they used was for uh for it uh
the Chain Reaction right um yeah I guess

4796
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:28,960
the Chain Reaction right um yeah I guess
 

4797
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:31,750
the Chain Reaction right um yeah I guess
it's possible but uh I don't I don't

4798
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:31,760
it's possible but uh I don't I don't
 

4799
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,310
it's possible but uh I don't I don't
think I personally don't think it's

4800
01:36:33,310 --> 01:36:33,320
think I personally don't think it's
 

4801
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,510
think I personally don't think it's
worth worrying about that I think that

4802
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
worth worrying about that I think that
 

4803
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:37,830
worth worrying about that I think that
the you know it's an opportunity

4804
01:36:37,830 --> 01:36:37,840
the you know it's an opportunity
 

4805
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:40,430
the you know it's an opportunity
balancing opportunities in Risk I think

4806
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:40,440
balancing opportunities in Risk I think
 

4807
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,070
balancing opportunities in Risk I think
if you take any

4808
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:42,080
if you take any
 

4809
01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:44,390
if you take any
technology uh there's opportunity in

4810
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:44,400
technology uh there's opportunity in
 

4811
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,870
technology uh there's opportunity in
risk and you know it's easy to point

4812
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:45,880
risk and you know it's easy to point
 

4813
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:49,669
risk and you know it's easy to point
I'll point at the car uh they pollute

4814
01:36:49,669 --> 01:36:49,679
I'll point at the car uh they pollute
 

4815
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:53,830
I'll point at the car uh they pollute
and they um about what um 1.25 million

4816
01:36:53,830 --> 01:36:53,840
and they um about what um 1.25 million
 

4817
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,550
and they um about what um 1.25 million
people get killed every year around the

4818
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:55,560
people get killed every year around the
 

4819
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:59,229
people get killed every year around the
world because of them despite that I

4820
01:36:59,229 --> 01:36:59,239
world because of them despite that I
 

4821

useful we all love many of us love them
 

4825
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:07,629
useful we all love many of us love them
uh and those technical problems can be

4826
01:37:07,629 --> 01:37:07,639
uh and those technical problems can be
 

4827
01:37:07,639 --> 01:37:10,310
uh and those technical problems can be
solved I think they are becoming safer I

4828
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,320
solved I think they are becoming safer I
 

4829
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,910
solved I think they are becoming safer I
think they're becoming less polluting at

4830
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:11,920
think they're becoming less polluting at
 

4831
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,470
think they're becoming less polluting at
least some of them are um and every

least some of them are um and every
 

4833
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,270
least some of them are um and every
technology you can name has a story like

4834
01:37:18,270 --> 01:37:18,280
technology you can name has a story like
 

4835

tool have have you had people tell you
 

4881
01:38:11,159 --> 01:38:13,070
tool have have you had people tell you
about on the robotic side that like I

4882
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:13,080
about on the robotic side that like I
 

4883
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,350
about on the robotic side that like I
don't think you could do this the kind

4884

people would have to meet with me uh
 

4931
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,350
people would have to meet with me uh
once a semester or something and they

4932

once a semester or something and they
 

4933
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:19,550
once a semester or something and they
frequently would ask you know uh what

frequently would ask you know uh what
they should do and I think the advice I

4936
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:22,159
they should do and I think the advice I
 

4937
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:24,990
they should do and I think the advice I
used to give was something like uh well

4938
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:25,000
used to give was something like uh well
 

4939
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:28,550
used to give was something like uh well

can get you know the other version of
 

4955
01:39:43,159 --> 01:39:45,310
can get you know the other version of
that is you know try and figure out what

01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:45,320
that is you know try and figure out what
 

4957
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,229
that is you know try and figure out what
you want to do and and do that because I

you want to do and and do that because I
don't I don't think a lot of people

4960
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:49,080
don't I don't think a lot of people
 

4961
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:50,510
don't I don't think a lot of people
think that they're in a channel right

4962
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:50,520
think that they're in a channel right
 

4963
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:53,950
think that they're in a channel right
and there's a limited opportunities but

4964
01:39:53,950 --> 01:39:53,960
and there's a limited opportunities but
 

4965
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,870
and there's a limited opportunities but
yeah it's usually wider than they think

4966
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:56,880
yeah it's usually wider than they think
 

4967
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,390
yeah it's usually wider than they think
yeah the opportunities really are

4968
01:39:58,390 --> 01:39:58,400
yeah the opportunities really are
 

4969
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,550
yeah the opportunities really are
Limitless but like at the same time you

4970
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:00,560
Limitless but like at the same time you
 

4971
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,709
Limitless but like at the same time you
want

4972
01:40:01,709 --> 01:40:01,719
want
 

4973
01:40:01,719 --> 01:40:05,390
want
to pick a thing right and it's the the

4974
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:05,400
to pick a thing right and it's the the
 

4975

fact the some of the inspiration for the

4994
01:40:29,669 --> 01:40:29,679
fact the some of the inspiration for the
 

4995
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:33,990
fact the some of the inspiration for the
uh AI Institute is to say okay I've been

4996
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:34,000
uh AI Institute is to say okay I've been
 

4997
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,149
uh AI Institute is to say okay I've been
working in Locomotion for however many

4998
01:40:36,149 --> 01:40:36,159
working in Locomotion for however many
 

4999
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:39,950
working in Locomotion for however many
years it was uh let's do something else

5000
01:40:39,950 --> 01:40:39,960
years it was uh let's do something else
 

5001
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:43,430
years it was uh let's do something else
and uh it's it's a really fascinating

5002
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:43,440
and uh it's it's a really fascinating
 

5003
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:46,030
and uh it's it's a really fascinating
and interesting Challenge and and you uh

5004

and interesting Challenge and and you uh
 

5005
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,709
and interesting Challenge and and you uh
you're hoping to show it off also in the

5006
01:40:47,709 --> 01:40:47,719
you're hoping to show it off also in the
 

5007
01:40:47,719 --> 01:40:49,910
you're hoping to show it off also in the
same way as just about to start showing

5008
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:49,920
same way as just about to start showing
 

5009
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,669
same way as just about to start showing
some stuff off yeah

5010

some stuff off yeah
 

5011
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:53,430
some stuff off yeah
I hope we have YouTube channel I mean

5012
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:53,440
I hope we have YouTube channel I mean
 

5013

one of the challenges is it's one thing
 

5015
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,950
one of the challenges is it's one thing
to show athletic skills on YouTube

5016
01:40:58,950 --> 01:40:58,960
to show athletic skills on YouTube
 

5017
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:01,589
to show athletic skills on YouTube
showing cognitive function is a lot

5018
01:41:01,589 --> 01:41:01,599
showing cognitive function is a lot
 

5019
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:04,270
showing cognitive function is a lot
harder and I haven't quite figured out

5020
01:41:04,270 --> 01:41:04,280
harder and I haven't quite figured out
 

5021
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,790
harder and I haven't quite figured out
yet how that's going to work uh they

5022
01:41:06,790 --> 01:41:06,800
yet how that's going to work uh they
 

5023
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,910
yet how that's going to work uh they
might be a way there's a way there's a

01:41:08,910 --> 01:41:08,920
might be a way there's a way there's a
 

5025
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:12,589
might be a way there's a way there's a

5026
01:41:12,589 --> 01:41:12,599
way why not I also do
 

5027
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:15,270
way why not I also do
think sucking at a task is also

5028
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:15,280
think sucking at a task is also
 

5029
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,910
think sucking at a task is also
compelling like the uh incremental

better even in athletic intelligence

5036
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:24,560
better even in athletic intelligence
 

5037
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,229

01:41:29,229 --> 01:41:29,239
falling and slowly figuring that out I
 

5041
01:41:29,239 --> 01:41:30,390

especially with a cognitive task it's

the charm the CH there's charm and
there's something inspiring about a

01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:51,400
there's something inspiring about a
 

5061
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,229
there's something inspiring about a
robot sucking and then becoming less

5062
01:41:54,229 --> 01:41:54,239
robot sucking and then becoming less
 

5063
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:57,270
robot sucking and then becoming less
terrible slowly at a task no I think

5064
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:57,280
terrible slowly at a task no I think
 

5065
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,629
terrible slowly at a task no I think
you're right that kind of reveals

5066
01:41:58,629 --> 01:41:58,639
you're right that kind of reveals
 

5067
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:00,790
you're right that kind of reveals
something about about

5068
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:00,800
something about about
 

5069
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,109
something about about
ourselves and ultimately that's what's

5070
01:42:03,109 --> 01:42:03,119
ourselves and ultimately that's what's
 

5071
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:04,629
ourselves and ultimately that's what's
one of the coolest things about robots

5072
01:42:04,629 --> 01:42:04,639
one of the coolest things about robots
 

5073
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:07,350
one of the coolest things about robots
is it's kind of a mirror about what

5074
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:07,360
is it's kind of a mirror about what
 

5075
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,510
is it's kind of a mirror about what
makes humans special just by watching

5076
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:09,520
makes humans special just by watching
 

5077
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,189
makes humans special just by watching
how hard it is to make a robot do the

5078
01:42:12,189 --> 01:42:12,199
how hard it is to make a robot do the
 

5079
01:42:12,199 --> 01:42:14,189
how hard it is to make a robot do the
things that humans do you realize how

5080
01:42:14,189 --> 01:42:14,199
things that humans do you realize how
 

5081
01:42:14,199 --> 01:42:15,629
things that humans do you realize how
special we are

5082
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:15,639
special we are
 

5083
01:42:15,639 --> 01:42:18,750
