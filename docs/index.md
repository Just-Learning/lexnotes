## The Idea

I subscribed Lex's podcasts for a while, and found its very insightful, I'd like to consume more of his episodes, but most of them are 2-4 hours long, max 8 hours, very feel are less than 1 hour. there are 400+ episodes in total.

They are way to long

- The transcript of a 3 hour long episode is full of 120 pages of A4 with 12 pt font size
- 2x speed still takes a solid hour for each episode

Which episode to listen?
- I am not sure which episode I am insterested from the key notes
- I'd like to XRay the content before consuming
- There are some summery websites but none of them offers the feature I need
- So I decided to build one

Bonus
- learn LLM to solve a pain point for my own life
- Browse my XRay result rather than swipe TicTok
