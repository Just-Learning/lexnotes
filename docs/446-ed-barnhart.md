## The main arguments

- **Existence of Lost Civilizations**: Ed Barnhart argues that many lost civilizations, particularly in the Amazon rainforest, remain undiscovered. He references archaeological findings like Gobekli Tepe and Amazonian geoglyphs to illustrate that our understanding of ancient civilizations is still evolving, challenging the notion that human history is fully mapped out. This argument emphasizes the potential for future discoveries that could reshape our understanding of human history.

- **Migration to the Americas**: Barnhart suggests that the first humans migrated to the Americas much earlier than previously believed, possibly as far back as 60,000 years ago. This challenges traditional timelines and highlights the adaptability of early humans in harsh environments, suggesting a more complex narrative of human migration and settlement.

- **Pyramids in South America**: The discussion includes how pyramids in Peru, such as Huaca Prieta, were constructed hundreds of years before those in Egypt, dating back to 6000 BCE. This shifts the narrative of civilization's origins and architectural achievements away from the Old World, suggesting that significant advancements occurred independently in the Americas.

- **Role of Religion and Shamanism**: Barnhart emphasizes the importance of religion, particularly shamanism, in the development of early South American civilizations. He posits that the Amazon may have been a cultural cradle for religious ideas that influenced various cultures across the continent, highlighting the interconnectedness of spiritual beliefs and societal development.

- **Cultural Commonalities and Language Evolution**: Barnhart raises questions about the rapid diversification of languages in the Maya region, suggesting that a common writing system may have allowed for the coexistence of multiple languages. He speculates on the mechanics of language evolution during periods of acculturation and disease, indicating that there is still much to learn about the linguistic history of the Americas.

## Any notable quotes

- "For the vast majority of human existence, we’ve been nomadic... once humans figured out how to stay in a place, that’s the initial trigger to what would become civilization."
  - This quote highlights the pivotal transition from nomadic lifestyles to settled communities, marking a significant moment in human history.

- "I think there are civilizations that are just under the ocean, and just the wave action have destroyed them and what they haven’t destroyed buried deep."
  - Barnhart emphasizes the destructive power of nature on historical evidence, suggesting that much of our past may be lost to time.

- "There must have been a way that multiple languages understood the same writing system."
  - This reflects Barnhart's belief in the complexity of language evolution and the potential for shared linguistic systems among ancient cultures.

- "I think religion in South America began in the Amazon."
  - This statement underscores the Amazon's significance as a cultural and spiritual hub, challenging the focus on coastal civilizations.

- "The Inca had the quipu, this knotted string records, but it was definitely encoding more than just math."
  - Barnhart discusses the complexity of the quipu system, suggesting it served as a form of written language beyond mere numerical records.
