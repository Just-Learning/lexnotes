# 446 Ed Barnhart

## The main arguments

- **Existence of Lost Civilizations**: Ed Barnhart argues that many lost civilizations, particularly in the Amazon rainforest, remain undiscovered. He cites archaeological findings like Gobekli Tepe and Amazonian geoglyphs to illustrate that our understanding of ancient civilizations is still evolving. This challenges the notion that human history is fully mapped out and suggests that significant discoveries are yet to come.

- **Human Migration to the Americas**: Barnhart posits that the first humans may have migrated to the Americas as early as 60,000 years ago, supported by DNA evidence indicating complex migration patterns. This reshapes the narrative of human history and the development of civilizations, suggesting a more intricate timeline than previously accepted.

- **Civilization in North America**: He highlights that North America, particularly the Mississippi region, was home to complex societies like the Mound Builders, who constructed large earthen pyramids. This challenges the perception that significant civilizations only existed in Mesoamerica and South America.

- **Impact of Disease on Indigenous Populations**: Barnhart discusses the catastrophic effects of European diseases on Native American populations following contact, estimating that up to 90% of the population may have died. This loss of life also resulted in the erasure of vast amounts of cultural knowledge and practices.

- **Cultural and Religious Practices**: Barnhart emphasizes the role of religion and shamanism in shaping early civilizations, arguing that practices involving hallucinogens were crucial in forming cultural identities. He also challenges the view that ancient Andean religions were strictly polytheistic, suggesting a more nuanced understanding of their belief systems.

## Any notable quotes

  - This quote underscores the pivotal transition from nomadic lifestyles to settled communities, marking a significant moment in human history.

- "I think there are lost civilizations out there, and I think we’ll find them."
  - Barnhart expresses optimism about future archaeological discoveries, suggesting that our understanding of history is far from complete.

- "The power of nature and geology is really magical... there’s probably a lot that are just under the ocean."
  - This emphasizes the destructive power of natural forces in erasing evidence of past civilizations, underscoring the fragility of human achievements.

- "Ideas are more powerful than weapons."
  - Barnhart reflects on the transformative power of ideas, particularly in the context of religion and culture, suggesting that they shape societies more profoundly than physical might.

- "If you don’t stop thinking like a western European and start trying to put yourself in the mindset of these people, you will never understand any of it."
  - This quote highlights the importance of cultural perspective in understanding ancient civilizations, advocating for a more empathetic approach to historical interpretation.
