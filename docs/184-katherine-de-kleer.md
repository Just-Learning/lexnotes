- **Education**: University of California, Berkeley (2010–2017) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2005–2009)
- **Affiliation**: California Institute of Technology
- **Research interests**: Planetary Science and Astronomy


## The Main Arguments

- **Reclassification of Pluto**: Katherine discusses the reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, emphasizing that this change was driven by the discovery of other similar-sized objects in the Kuiper Belt. This highlights the evolving nature of scientific definitions and classifications, which can shift as new discoveries are made. The significance lies in understanding that science is not static but rather a dynamic field that adapts to new information.

- **Fluid Definitions in Planetary Science**: The conversation touches on the complexities of defining celestial bodies such as planets, moons, and asteroids. Katherine argues that while the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has set technical definitions, these categories are fluid and often overlap. This point underscores the challenges scientists face in categorizing celestial objects and reflects the ongoing debates within the scientific community.

- **Exploration of Moons vs. Planets**: Katherine expresses her belief that exploring moons, particularly in the outer solar system, represents the next frontier in planetary science. She argues that moons like Io and Europa offer unique insights into geological processes and potential habitability, which are often overlooked in favor of planets. This perspective encourages a shift in exploration priorities, advocating for a more balanced approach to studying both planets and their moons.

- **Tidal Heating and Geological Activity**: The discussion includes an explanation of tidal heating, particularly concerning Io and Europa. Katherine explains how gravitational interactions with Jupiter lead to geological activity on these moons, which is crucial for understanding their potential for hosting life. This argument emphasizes the importance of studying these processes to gain insights into the conditions that may support life beyond Earth.

- **Potential for Life on Europa and Enceladus**: Katherine discusses the potential for life on Europa and Enceladus, emphasizing the importance of subsurface oceans and hydrothermal activity. She argues that these environments could provide the necessary conditions for life, making them prime targets for future exploration. This point highlights the significance of astrobiology in understanding the broader implications of life in the universe.

## Any Notable Quotes

- "The declassification was really just a realization that it was in the same category as the other planets in the solar system."
  - This quote encapsulates the evolving nature of scientific understanding and classification, illustrating how new discoveries can reshape our views.

- "I just personally don't care; my level of interest in something has nothing to do with what it's classified as."
  - Katherine emphasizes the importance of scientific inquiry over rigid classifications, highlighting her passion for exploration and the joy found in the details of research.

- "The exploration of the moons in the outer solar system is the next frontier of solar system science."
  - This statement underscores her belief in the significance of studying moons for understanding planetary processes, advocating for a shift in exploration focus.

- "If any of those objects were in the inner solar system, they would be studied intently and would be very interesting."
  - This quote reflects the bias in exploration priorities and the potential for groundbreaking discoveries in less-studied regions of the solar system.

- "I would put money on there being aliens; I would not put money on us having definitive evidence of them in my lifetime."
  - Katherine expresses a hopeful yet realistic perspective on the search for extraterrestrial life, balancing optimism with the understanding of scientific limitations.
