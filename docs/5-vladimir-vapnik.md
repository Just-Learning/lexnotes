- **Place of birth**: Soviet Union
- **Affiliation**: NEC Laboratories
- **Research interests**: Machine Learning, Statistics, and Computer Science


## The Main Arguments

- **Instrumentalism vs. Realism in Science**: Vapnik discusses the philosophical positions of instrumentalism (theories as tools for prediction) and realism (theories as reflections of reality). He argues that machine learning primarily operates from an instrumentalist perspective, focusing on prediction rather than understanding the underlying reality.

- **Role of Mathematics**: Vapnik emphasizes the importance of mathematics in understanding reality, suggesting that mathematical structures can reveal fundamental truths about the world. He critiques the notion that human intuition can surpass mathematical reasoning, asserting that intuition is often limited and can lead to misconceptions.

- **Learning Mechanisms**: The conversation highlights two mechanisms of learning: strong convergence and big convergence. Vapnik argues that the latter, which incorporates predicates, is essential for effective learning and can significantly reduce the amount of training data required.

- **Critique of Deep Learning**: Vapnik expresses skepticism about deep learning, suggesting that it is often based on flawed interpretations and lacks a solid mathematical foundation. He argues that deep learning may not be the most efficient approach to solving learning problems and that simpler models could achieve similar results with less data.

- **Intelligence and Teaching**: Vapnik raises questions about the nature of intelligence and the role of teachers in the learning process. He posits that understanding how teachers convey knowledge and the predicates they use is crucial for advancing artificial intelligence and learning theories.

## Any Notable Quotes

- **On Instrumentalism vs. Realism**: "In philosophy, they distinguish between two positions: positions of instrumentalism, where you're creating theories of prediction, and position of realism, where you're trying to understand what God did." This quote encapsulates the philosophical underpinnings of Vapnik's approach to machine learning.

- **On Mathematics**: "If you try to very carefully look at all the equations which define conditional probability, you can understand something about reality more than from your fantasy." This highlights Vapnik's belief in the power of mathematics to uncover truths about the world.

- **On Human Intuition**: "The best human intuition is putting in axioms; then it is technical where you have to arrive." This statement underscores Vapnik's view that intuition is often limited and that rigorous mathematical reasoning is more reliable.

- **On Deep Learning**: "Mathematics does not know deep learning. Mathematics does not know neurons; it is just if you like to say piecewise linear function, say that and do it in a class of piecewise linear function." This critique emphasizes Vapnik's belief that deep learning lacks a solid mathematical foundation.

- **On Intelligence**: "To understand intelligence, first of all, try to understand what they will teach us, how a teacher teaches, why one teacher is better than another one." This quote reflects Vapnik's focus on the pedagogical aspects of learning and intelligence.
