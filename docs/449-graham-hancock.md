- **Born**: 1950 , Edinburgh, United Kingdom
- **Spouse**: Santha Faiia

## The main arguments

- **Existence of a Lost Civilization**: Hancock argues that an advanced civilization existed during the last Ice Age, which was destroyed by a global cataclysm around 12,000 years ago. This challenges the mainstream view that civilization developed independently in various regions after the Younger Dryas, suggesting a more complex prehistory that could reshape our understanding of human development.

- **Göbekli Tepe as Evidence**: Hancock presents Göbekli Tepe as a pivotal archaeological site that indicates advanced societal structures existed before known civilizations. He argues that its construction by hunter-gatherers demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of architecture and social organization, contradicting the belief that agriculture was necessary for complex societies.

- **Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis**: The discussion includes the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which posits that a cosmic event led to drastic climate changes and extinctions. Hancock links this to the potential loss of an advanced civilization, arguing that it provides a plausible explanation for abrupt changes in human and animal populations.

- **Ancient Maps and Navigation**: Hancock highlights ancient Portolano-style maps that depict Antarctica and show accurate relative longitudes, suggesting that ancient civilizations possessed advanced navigational skills. He speculates that these maps were based on older source maps that have not survived, indicating a sophisticated understanding of geography long before modern advancements.

- **Cultural Interconnectivity and Myths**: Hancock discusses the prevalence of similar myths and spiritual beliefs across different cultures, suggesting a shared heritage or common source of knowledge. This challenges the notion of isolated cultural development and implies a deeper, interconnected human history.

## Any notable quotes

- **"The big question for me in that timeline is why didn’t we do it sooner?"**
  This quote encapsulates Hancock's inquiry into the delayed emergence of civilization, highlighting gaps in our understanding of human history.

- **"Göbekli Tepe was a game changer, but I think it’s a game changer for everything."**
  Hancock emphasizes the significance of Göbekli Tepe in redefining our understanding of early human societies and their capabilities.

- **"The Younger Dryas really ticks all the boxes as a worldwide disaster."**
  This statement underscores the catastrophic nature of the Younger Dryas event and its implications for human history, suggesting a global impact.

- **"I think there is an urge to explore in all of humanity."**
  Hancock reflects on the intrinsic human desire to explore and understand the world, which he believes has been a driving force in human evolution and migration.

- **"Oral traditions... are able to preserve information for very long periods of time."**
  This quote highlights the value of oral history in transmitting knowledge across generations, challenging the primacy of written records in understanding human culture.

## Relevant topics or themes

- **Lost Civilizations**: The episode explores the concept of lost civilizations, particularly during the Ice Age, and how their existence could reshape our understanding of human history. Hancock's hypothesis invites listeners to consider advanced societies that have left little trace.

- **Archaeological Discoveries**: The discussion of Göbekli Tepe and other archaeological findings illustrates the evolving nature of archaeology and how new discoveries can challenge established narratives. Hancock's field experiences provide a personal connection to these themes.

- **Climate Change and Extinction Events**: The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis serves as a focal point for discussing the relationship between environmental changes and human development. Hancock connects these events to the potential collapse of advanced societies, raising questions about resilience and adaptation.

- **Cultural Interconnectivity**: Hancock's exploration of shared myths and spiritual beliefs across cultures suggests a deeper interconnectedness in human history. This theme encourages a broader view of cultural evolution, emphasizing the exchange of ideas and knowledge.

- **Astronomy and Human Civilization**: The significance of astronomical knowledge in ancient cultures is a recurring theme, with Hancock arguing that understanding celestial events was crucial for societal development. This perspective highlights the importance of the cosmos in shaping human narratives and practices.

- **Shamanism and Consciousness**: Hancock posits that shamanism is the origin of civilization, suggesting that early humans' exploration of altered states of consciousness through psychedelics led to the development of complex societies. This theme connects to broader discussions about the role of consciousness in human evolution and societal structures.

Overall, the episode presents a thought-provoking exploration of human history, challenging conventional narratives and inviting listeners to consider the complexities of our past. Hancock's engaging storytelling and willingness to question established beliefs make for a compelling discussion.
