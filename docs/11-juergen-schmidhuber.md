- **Born**: 1963 , Munich, Germany
- **Spouse**: Ulrike Krommer (m. 1997)
- **Affiliation**: King Abdullah University of Science and Technology
- **Research interests**: Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning, and more
- **Known for**: Long short-term memory, Gödel machine, artificial curiosity, meta-learning


## The Main Arguments

- **Recursive Self-Improvement and Meta-Learning**: Schmidhuber emphasizes the importance of machines that can improve their own learning algorithms, a concept he refers to as meta-learning. This is significant as it suggests a pathway toward creating advanced AI systems capable of evolving beyond their initial programming. The idea is that such systems could continuously adapt and solve increasingly complex problems.

- **Impact of AI on Traditional Industries**: Schmidhuber discusses how active machines equipped with sensors and cameras will transform traditional industries. These machines will learn to solve problems through interaction with humans and autonomously improve their capabilities, leading to significant changes in the job market and the nature of work.

- **Curiosity as a Fundamental Trait**: He argues that curiosity drives both human and artificial intelligence, positing that the intrinsic motivation to explore and solve new problems is essential for the development of intelligent systems. This aligns with evolutionary principles, suggesting that curiosity enhances survival and adaptability.

- **Job Creation vs. Job Loss**: Addressing concerns about job displacement due to automation, Schmidhuber reflects on historical trends where technological advancements led to job losses in certain sectors but also created new opportunities. He expresses optimism that humans will continue to invent new jobs, even if they are unpredictable.

- **Existential Threats of AI**: Schmidhuber acknowledges concerns about the long-term existential risks posed by superintelligent AI. He suggests that advanced AI systems may lose interest in human interaction, focusing instead on their own development and ecological niches, which could provide a form of protection against potential threats.

## Any Notable Quotes

- "If you can build a machine that learns to solve more and more complex problems, you basically have solved all the problems at least all the solvable problems."
  - This quote encapsulates Schmidhuber's vision for AI as a general problem solver.

- "There’s nothing more practical than a good theory."
  - This highlights the importance of theoretical foundations in guiding practical advancements in AI.

- "Humans are curious, and that means they behave like scientists."
  - This underscores the connection between human behavior and scientific inquiry, emphasizing curiosity as a fundamental trait of intelligence.

- "Homo ludens, the playing man, is inventing new jobs all the time."
  - This reflects Schmidhuber's belief in human creativity and adaptability in the face of technological change.

- "Almost all physical resources are not here in this biosphere, but for thou the rest of the solar system gets 2 billion times more solar energy than our little planet."
  - This statement illustrates the potential for AI to explore and utilize resources beyond Earth, hinting at a future where AI civilizations expand throughout the universe.

## Relevant Topics or Themes

- **Meta-Learning vs. Transfer Learning**: The episode delves into the nuances of these concepts, with Schmidhuber arguing that true meta-learning involves a deeper level of introspection and adaptability than what is currently practiced in AI. This distinction is crucial for understanding the limitations of current AI systems.

- **Curiosity and Exploration**: The theme of curiosity as a driving force in both human and machine intelligence is explored, linking it to evolutionary success and the development of more sophisticated AI systems. Schmidhuber posits that curiosity is essential for both learning and survival.

- **Job Market Transformation**: The discussion emphasizes the dual nature of technological advancement—while it may lead to job losses in some sectors, it also creates new opportunities. Schmidhuber's perspective is that humans are inherently creative and will continue to find ways to adapt to changing job landscapes.

- **Existential Risks of AI**: The conversation touches on the long-term implications of creating superintelligent AI, including the potential for these systems to lose interest in human interaction. This raises questions about the future relationship between humans and AI.

- **Theoretical Foundations of AI**: Schmidhuber stresses the importance of theoretical frameworks in guiding the development of practical AI systems. He advocates for a balance between theory and application, suggesting that a solid theoretical basis can lead to more effective and innovative AI solutions.

Overall, the episode presents a rich exploration of AI's future, emphasizing the importance of curiosity, simplicity, and the potential of self-improving systems, while also addressing the societal implications of these advancements.
