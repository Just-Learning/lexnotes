- **Born**: 1978
- **Books**: Galileo's Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness
- **Affiliation**: Durham University
- **Research interests**: Philosophy of Mind, Metaphysics, Consciousness, and more
- **Main interests**: Philosophy of mind
- **Notable ideas**: Panpsychism


## The Main Arguments

- **Panpsychism as a Fundamental View**: Goff argues that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of the universe, suggesting that even the smallest particles possess some form of consciousness. This challenges traditional views that see consciousness as an emergent property of complex systems, such as human brains. The significance lies in its potential to reshape our understanding of consciousness and its role in the universe.

- **Limitations of Scientific Methodology**: Goff posits that consciousness cannot be fully explained by conventional scientific methods, which rely on public observation. He emphasizes that consciousness is qualitatively different and primarily privately observable, meaning that subjective experiences cannot be directly accessed by others. This highlights the need for a broader conception of science that can accommodate the unique nature of consciousness.

- **Distinction Between Public and Private Observation**: Goff elaborates on the difference between publicly observable phenomena (like physical behaviors) and privately observable experiences (like feelings and thoughts). He argues that while science can study behaviors, it cannot directly study consciousness, complicating the scientific approach to understanding it.

- **Critique of Daniel Dennett's Views**: Goff contrasts his panpsychist view with Daniel Dennett's narrative theory of consciousness, which suggests that consciousness arises from complex cognitive processes. Goff argues that Dennett's approach fails to account for the subjective quality of experiences, which he believes is essential to understanding consciousness.

- **Ethical Implications of Consciousness**: Goff raises questions about the moral status of non-human entities, suggesting that if consciousness is ubiquitous, it may lead to a reevaluation of how we treat animals and artificial intelligences. This challenges existing ethical frameworks and encourages a more compassionate approach to all conscious beings.

## Any Notable Quotes

- "I think consciousness is the ultimate nature of matter."
  - This encapsulates Goff's central thesis that consciousness is not merely a byproduct of physical processes but a fundamental aspect of reality.

- "Consciousness is not publicly observable."
  - This statement underscores the unique challenge that consciousness presents to scientific inquiry, emphasizing the need for new methodologies.

- "The thing we are trying to explain is not publicly observable."
  - Goff highlights the paradox of studying consciousness, complicating traditional scientific approaches.

- "If consciousness is ubiquitous, it changes how we think about moral value."
  - This points to the broader implications of panpsychism for ethics and our treatment of other beings.

- "We need to sharply distinguish the ontological question from the epistemological question."
  - This reflects Goff's nuanced approach to understanding consciousness, emphasizing the complexity of determining what is conscious and how we know it.

## Relevant Topics or Themes

- **Consciousness and Reality**: The episode delves into the nature of consciousness, exploring how it relates to the physical world. Goff's panpsychism suggests a radical rethinking of consciousness as a fundamental property of all matter, which could have profound implications for philosophy and science.

- **Scientific Methodology**: Goff critiques the limitations of the scientific method in studying consciousness, advocating for a more expansive approach that can accommodate subjective experiences. This raises questions about the nature of scientific inquiry and its ability to address complex phenomena.

- **Ethics and Morality**: The discussion touches on the ethical implications of panpsychism, particularly regarding how we treat animals and artificial intelligences. Goff's views challenge listeners to reconsider their moral frameworks and the value of consciousness in ethical considerations.

- **Philosophical Debates**: The episode engages with contemporary philosophical debates, particularly the contrast between Goff's panpsychism and Dennett's narrative theory. This highlights the ongoing discourse in the philosophy of mind and the diverse perspectives on consciousness.

- **The Nature of Self and Identity**: Goff's exploration of consciousness also leads to discussions about selfhood and identity, particularly how consciousness shapes our understanding of what it means to be a person. This connects to broader existential questions about human experience and meaning.

- **The Role of Communication in Science**: Goff critiques the scientific community for poor communication of complex ideas, emphasizing the importance of making philosophical concepts accessible to the public. This theme underscores the need for scientists and philosophers to engage with broader audiences to inspire understanding and dialogue.

Overall, the episode presents a rich and nuanced exploration of consciousness, blending philosophical inquiry with ethical considerations and scientific challenges. Goff's insights encourage listeners to reflect on their own beliefs about consciousness and its implications for understanding reality and morality.

## Additional Insights

- **Philosophical Zombies and Consciousness**: Goff discusses the concept of philosophical zombiesâ€”entities that behave like humans but lack consciousness. He raises epistemological questions about how we can determine which beings are conscious, emphasizing the difficulty of assessing consciousness in non-human entities.

- **Future of Consciousness Studies**: Goff expresses hope for interdisciplinary collaboration among scientists, philosophers, and engineers to further explore consciousness. He suggests that engineering intelligent systems could provide insights into the nature of consciousness and free will.

- **Simulation Hypothesis**: The conversation touches on the idea of living in a simulation, with Goff arguing that consciousness is tied to the physical substrate of the brain, challenging the notion that consciousness could be replicated purely through software.

- **Meaning and Purpose**: Goff reflects on the search for meaning in life, suggesting that consciousness is central to understanding value and purpose. He advocates for a hopeful perspective on existence, even amidst uncertainty.

- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Goff emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach to studying consciousness, integrating insights from neuroscience, philosophy, and artificial intelligence to deepen our understanding of this complex phenomenon.

This episode serves as a thought-provoking exploration of consciousness, ethics, and the philosophical implications of emerging technologies, encouraging listeners to engage with these profound questions in their own lives.
