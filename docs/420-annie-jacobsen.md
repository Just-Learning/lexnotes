# 420 Annie Jacobsen

## The main arguments

- **Nuclear War's Catastrophic Potential**: Jacobsen emphasizes that nuclear war could result in billions of deaths, not only from immediate explosions but also from subsequent nuclear winter and starvation. This argument underscores the urgent need for reform in nuclear weapons policies and global disarmament discussions, highlighting the existential threat posed by nuclear arsenals.

- **Launch on Warning Policy**: Jacobsen critiques the U.S. "Launch on Warning" policy, which allows the president only six minutes to respond to a perceived nuclear threat. She argues that this policy places an immense psychological burden on leaders, increasing the risk of hasty decisions that could escalate into nuclear conflict.

- **Deterrence Theory's Fragility**: Jacobsen challenges the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence, asserting that the strategy of mutually assured destruction is inherently fragile. She posits that once the first missile is launched, the entire premise of deterrence collapses, raising doubts about its reliability in maintaining peace.

- **Tactical vs. Strategic Nuclear Weapons**: Jacobsen highlights the distinction between tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, warning that the use of tactical nuclear weapons could lead to full-scale nuclear war. This blurring of lines between conventional and nuclear warfare poses significant risks to global security.

- **Human Error and Miscommunication**: The discussion includes historical close calls, such as the 1979 incident where a training tape was mistaken for a real threat. Jacobsen uses this example to illustrate the potential for human error in nuclear command and control systems, emphasizing the precariousness of global security and the need for improved communication protocols.
