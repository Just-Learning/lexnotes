## The Main Arguments

- **Mathematics as a Creative Tool**: Po-Shen Loh emphasizes that mathematics should be seen as a tool for creative problem-solving rather than just a set of formulas to memorize. This perspective is significant as it advocates for a shift in math education towards fostering creativity and critical thinking, which can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of the subject.

- **Innovative Contact Tracing with Novid**: Loh discusses the development of Novid, an app designed for anonymous contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike traditional methods, Novid allows users to proactively manage their exposure risk, highlighting the importance of user incentives in public health technology. This approach represents a significant advancement in how technology can be utilized for public health.

- **Feedback Loops in Disease Control**: Loh explains how traditional disease control methods often create negative feedback loops, leading to involuntary isolation. In contrast, Novid aims to create a positive feedback loop by empowering individuals to manage their exposure risk voluntarily, promoting proactive health behaviors and potentially improving public health outcomes.

- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Loh stresses the necessity of collaboration among mathematicians, software engineers, and public health experts to effectively address pandemics. This interdisciplinary approach is crucial for developing solutions that are both mathematically sound and practically applicable, showcasing the importance of diverse expertise in tackling complex problems.

- **Voting Theory and Decision-Making**: The discussion delves into the complexities of voting systems, particularly the concept of a voting tree. Loh presents a theoretical framework for conducting elections through a structured system of runoffs, emphasizing the challenges of determining a fair winner in elections with multiple candidates. This exploration highlights the intersection of mathematics and social systems, raising questions about how we can improve democratic processes.

## Any Notable Quotes

- "I think the interesting thing about the math is that you can see a question that you didn't know how to start doing it before and over a course of thinking about it you can come up with a way to solve it."
  - This quote encapsulates Loh's philosophy on mathematics as a tool for invention and problem-solving.

- "The distance between you and a disease is not measured in feet or seconds; it's measured in terms of how many close physical relationships separate you."
  - This statement reframes our understanding of disease transmission, emphasizing the relational aspect of public health.

- "If you can make a system of incentives so that everybody trying to maximize their own situation somehow contributes to the whole, that's a game's theoretic solution to a very hard problem."
  - Loh articulates the essence of his approach to public health, highlighting the importance of aligning individual incentives with collective well-being.

- "There's always a candidate who beats at least half of the other people."
  - This mathematical fact about voting systems illustrates the underlying principles of fairness and representation in elections.

- "I wanted to maximize a certain score which was for how many person years after I'm no longer here anymore did what I do matter."
  - This quote reflects Loh's perspective on legacy and the impact of one's work on future generations.
