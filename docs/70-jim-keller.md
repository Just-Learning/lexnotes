## The Main Arguments

- **Comparison of Human Brains and Computers**: Keller emphasizes the differences between human cognition and computer architectures, noting that while computers operate on a global memory model, human brains are a complex network of interconnected neurons. This distinction is significant as it highlights the limitations of current AI systems, which, despite being modeled after neural networks, lack the depth of human understanding.

- **Abstraction Layers in Computer Engineering**: Keller discusses the various abstraction layers in computer engineering, from atoms to transistors to microarchitectures. He argues that a deep understanding of these layers is essential for building efficient computers, underscoring the complexity of computer design and the need for interdisciplinary knowledge.

- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Stability**: Keller points out that while instruction sets like x86 have remained stable for decades, the underlying implementations have evolved significantly. This stability provides a consistent foundation for new technologies, emphasizing the importance of foundational knowledge in engineering.

- **The Role of Parallelism in Computing**: Keller differentiates between found parallelism (where dependencies are discovered in a sequential narrative) and given parallelism (where tasks can be executed simultaneously). This distinction is crucial for understanding modern processor design, particularly in GPUs, which are optimized for handling large datasets and complex computations.

- **Moore's Law and Its Future**: Keller reflects on Moore's Law, suggesting that while it has been predicted to end for years, innovations in semiconductor technology continue to push boundaries. He argues that the future of computing will involve not just shrinking transistors but also new architectures and methodologies that effectively leverage the increasing number of transistors.

## Any Notable Quotes

- "Computers are... two things: memory and computation."
  This quote encapsulates Keller's view on the fundamental components of computer architecture, emphasizing the dual nature of computing.

- "The way a modern computer works is you fetch large numbers of instructions... and then you execute in independent units."
  This highlights the complexity of modern computing and the shift from simple sequential processing to sophisticated methods of instruction execution.

- "If you look at a program and it runs, 90% of the execution is on 25 opcodes."
  This statement underscores the efficiency of modern programming and the importance of optimizing a small set of instructions for performance.

- "The best computer architects aren't that interested in people."
  Keller reflects on the human aspect of engineering, suggesting that successful teams require a balance of technical and interpersonal skills.

- "Every order of magnitude changes the computation fundamentally."
  This quote emphasizes the transformative impact of advancements in computing power on the nature of computation itself.
