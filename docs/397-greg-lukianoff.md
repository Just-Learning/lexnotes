# 397 Greg Lukianoff

## The Main Arguments

- **Definition of Cancel Culture**: Lukianoff defines cancel culture as campaigns aimed at getting individuals fired or de-platformed for speech that would typically be protected under the First Amendment. This definition is significant as it highlights the growing climate of fear surrounding free speech, particularly in academic settings.

- **Shift in Censorship Dynamics**: He notes a shift in censorship dynamics over the past two decades, where students and fellow professors have increasingly initiated cancellation campaigns, rather than just administrators. This evolution underscores the systemic nature of the issue and the growing involvement of various stakeholders in censorship.

- **Viewpoint Discrimination**: Lukianoff emphasizes that viewpoint discrimination—allowing freedom of speech except for certain opinions—is a significant issue. This argument is vital as it underscores the philosophical and moral implications of selective censorship, which can undermine the very foundation of free speech.

- **Censorship and Group Polarization**: He argues that censorship does not change people's opinions but drives them underground, leading to group polarization. This is crucial for understanding the long-term effects of cancel culture on societal discourse, as it can create echo chambers that stifle genuine dialogue.

- **Role of Education in Free Speech**: Lukianoff expresses concern over the lack of viewpoint diversity in academia, which can lead to a culture that does not value dissenting opinions. This lack of diversity can inhibit critical thinking and the pursuit of truth, which are essential in educational environments.

- **Cultural vs. Legal Free Speech**: He distinguishes between free speech law and free speech culture, arguing that a culture that does not value free speech will ultimately undermine legal protections. This distinction points to the need for a societal commitment to free speech beyond legal frameworks.

- **Administrative Involvement in Censorship**: Lukianoff discusses how deplatforming often involves coordination between students and administrators, suggesting that the problem is systemic rather than isolated. This insight is critical for understanding the dynamics of free speech issues in educational institutions.
