## The main arguments

- **Historical Purpose and Class Struggle**: Liulevicius discusses Marx's view that history is driven by class struggles, suggesting a purposeful trajectory toward the liberation of the proletariat. This perspective frames Marxism as a historical narrative that justifies revolutionary violence, influencing various movements throughout history.

- **Contradictions in Marxism**: The episode highlights the inherent contradictions within Marx's theories, particularly the tension between advocating for revolutionary violence and the ultimate goal of achieving a peaceful, classless society. This contradiction raises questions about the practicality of achieving utopia through violent means, which is crucial for understanding the failures of various communist regimes.

- **Fascism vs. Communism**: Liulevicius explores the ideological battle between fascism and communism, noting their significant differences despite both seeking to overthrow liberal democracy. Fascism emphasizes nationalism and racial purity, while communism focuses on class struggle and the abolition of class distinctions.

- **Totalitarianism**: The discussion includes the concept of totalitarianism, as articulated by Hannah Arendt, describing regimes that seek total control over society. Liulevicius argues that both Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, despite their ideological differences, shared characteristics of totalitarian governance, including the suppression of dissent and the demand for absolute loyalty.

- **The Role of Ideology in Governance**: Liulevicius examines how ideologies like communism and fascism can take on religious characteristics, with leaders treated as savior figures. This notion challenges the perception of these ideologies as purely secular, suggesting they can embody a form of secular religion that deeply influences societal structures and individual beliefs.
