## The Main Arguments

- **Comparison of Putin and Stalin**: Kotkin argues that while Vladimir Putin cannot be directly compared to Joseph Stalin due to the scale of Stalin's atrocities, both leaders share geopolitical ambitions and a historical context of Russian power dynamics. This comparison is significant as it highlights recurring themes in Russian leadership, particularly the tension between aspirations for greatness and the reality of diminished power.

- **Perpetual Geopolitics**: Kotkin introduces the concept of "perpetual geopolitics," suggesting that Russia's aggressive foreign policy is a strategic choice rather than an inherent cultural tendency. This reframes the narrative around Russian aggression, emphasizing that it is a conscious decision made by leaders rather than a deterministic outcome of Russian culture.

- **Western Perception and Responsibility**: Kotkin critiques the notion that the West is solely to blame for Russia's aggressive actions, arguing that this perspective ignores the agency of Russian leaders. He emphasizes that NATO's expansion does not justify Russia's invasions, as countries have the right to choose their alliances, complicating the understanding of international relations.

- **Psychological Factors in Leadership**: Kotkin discusses the psychological motivations behind Putin's actions, suggesting that a sense of historical grievance and a desire for national greatness drive his regime. This insight sheds light on the internal dynamics of authoritarian regimes and how leaders manipulate national narratives to justify aggressive policies.

- **Consequences of Authoritarianism**: The conversation touches on the broader implications of authoritarian rule, particularly how it stifles a nation's potential for growth and innovation. Kotkin argues that the greatest victims of Putin's regime are not just those in Ukraine but also the Russian people, who suffer under a repressive system that limits their freedoms and opportunities.
