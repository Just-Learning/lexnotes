- **Research interests**: Machine Learning, Data mining, Disease Informatics, and more


## The Main Arguments

- **Viruses as Machines**: Korkin posits that viruses should be viewed as highly efficient machines rather than living organisms. This perspective emphasizes their evolutionary adaptations that allow them to survive and replicate with minimal resources. This framing is significant as it shifts the focus from merely treating viruses as pathogens to understanding their complex biology.

- **Natural vs. Engineered Viruses**: Korkin expresses a greater concern for naturally occurring viruses, arguing that their evolutionary processes pose a more significant threat than engineered viruses. This highlights the need for vigilant monitoring of natural viral evolution, especially in the context of emerging infectious diseases.

- **Computational Biology's Role**: Korkin underscores the importance of computational methods in virology, particularly in reconstructing the 3D structures of viral proteins. This understanding is crucial for developing antiviral drugs and vaccines, as it allows researchers to predict how viruses interact with human proteins.

- **Universal Vaccines**: The discussion includes the aspiration to create universal vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of viruses, particularly influenza. Korkin argues that achieving this goal would represent a major advancement in public health, reducing the need for annual vaccinations and improving overall disease management.

- **Scientific Collaboration**: Korkin emphasizes the collaborative nature of scientific research, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid sharing of data and findings among scientists has accelerated the understanding of the virus and the development of treatments and vaccines, showcasing the importance of open communication in science.
