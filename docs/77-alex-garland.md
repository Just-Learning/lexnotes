## The Main Arguments

- **Subjective Reality vs. Simulation**: Garland argues against the notion that we live in a simulation, emphasizing the subjective nature of human perception. He suggests that our brains create educated guesses about reality, which can lead to a distorted understanding. This argument is significant as it challenges the popular belief in simulated existence and grounds the discussion in the tangible aspects of our universe.

This raises questions about consciousness and the nature of reality, suggesting that altered states do not necessarily lead to enlightenment.

He emphasizes that artists are influenced by scientific discoveries, highlighting the interplay between art and science and how narratives in film can reflect complex scientific ideas.

This highlights the importance of ethical considerations in AI development and the potential for positive outcomes if approached responsibly.
